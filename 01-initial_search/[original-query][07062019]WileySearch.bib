abstract = {Summary Cloud forensics analyzes digital evidence obtained from cloud computing environments. In the cloud, the traditional forensic focus of acquiring and analyzing snapshots of digital artifacts becomes significantly less relevant as many of the artifacts are ephemeral, while the history of state changes become pervasive. Thus, over the medium-to-long term, the task of forensically reconstructing prior events will become easier as a growing fraction of the relevant information will be explicitly recorded. However, in the short term, the shift to cloud computing necessitates a paradigm change for forensic acquisition and processing tools from primarily artifact-centric to primarily log-centric. As the discussion will show, existing tools are ill-equipped to deal with the situation and we urgently need a new generation of cloud-focused forensic tools.}

Therefore, secure protocols are essentially necessary for the RFID tags to guarantee privacy and authentication among them and the reader. This paper inspects privacy in the RFID systems. First, we survey four new-found RFID authentication protocols, and then, their weaknesses in formal privacy model are analyzed. Although the authors of the schemes claimed that their protocols completely resist privacy attacks, we formally prove that all of them suffer from the family of traceability attacks. Furthermore, not only are the four improved protocols proposed to prevent the aforementioned attacks, but also we provide formal analysis to guarantee the security and privacy of the proposed enhancements.

abstract = {ABSTRACTWireless mesh networks (WMNs) have emerged as a promising technology that provides low-cost broadband access to the Internet for fixed and mobile wireless end users. An orthogonal evolution in computer networking has been the rise of peer-to-peer (P2P) applications such as P2P data sharing. It is of interest to enable effective P2P data sharing in this type of networks. Conventional P2P data sharing systems are not cognizant of the underlying network topology and therefore suffer from inefficiency. We argue for dual-layer mesh network architecture with support from wireless mesh routers for P2P applications. The main contribution of this paper is P2PMesh: a topology-aware system that provides combined architecture and efficient schemes for enabling efficient P2P data sharing in WMNs. The P2PMesh architecture utilizes three schemes: (i) an efficient content lookup that mitigates traffic load imbalance at mesh routers; (ii) an efficient establishment of download paths; and (iii) a data transfer protocol for multi-hop wireless networks with limited capacity. We note here that the path establishment and data transfer schemes are specific to P2P traffic and that other traffic would use routes determined by the default routing protocol in the WMN. Simulation results suggest that P2PMesh has the potential to improve the performance of P2P applications in a wireless multi-hop setting; specifically, we focused on data sharing, but other P2P applications can also be supported by this approach.

abstract = {Abstract Dynamic environments pose a challenge for traditional access control models where permissions are granted or revoked merely based on predefined and static access policies making them incapable of dynamically adapting to changing conditions. Risk adaptive access control models have been gaining more attention in the research community as an alternative approach to overcome the limitations of traditional access control models. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is an emerging technology widely utilized in both physical and logical access control systems because of its contactless nature, low cost, high read/write speed and long distance operation. Serverless RFID system architecture offers better availability assurance and lower implementation cost, while access rights management is easier in server-based architecture. In this study, we continue to build on our previous research on the privacy and security of RFID access control systems without a backend database in order to overcome its limitations. We propose a hybrid design for a risk adaptive RFID access control system; that is, dynamically alternating between two access control modes, online (server-based) and offline (serverless), to adapt to the level of risk depending on rule-based risk scenarios and current risk value. The proposed design combines features of both serverless and risk adaptive access control systems. Copyright � 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Ground delay programs are air traffic flow management initiatives put in place when airport arrival demand is expected to exceed arrival capacity for an extended length of time, e.g. 4 h. Most of the problems we study can be modeled as assignment problems, where flights are assigned to arrival slots. In the context we analyze, however, these problems have important special structure, which allows us to develop special solution properties. In particular, solutions are measured both in terms of efficiency (delay minimization) and equity (delay distribution). We show that the theory of majorization provides a powerful tool in addressing solution equity. We consider problems with flight deletions and develop special solution properties and parametric methods. � 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. NETWORKS, 2009},

The architecture of DockerAnalyser is designed to crawl Docker images from a remote Docker registry, to analyse each image by running an analysis function, and to store the results into a local database. Users can build their own image analysers by instantiating DockerAnalyser with a custom analysis function and by configuring the architecture. More precisely, the steps needed to obtain new analysers are (1) replacing the analysis function used to analyse crawled Docker images, (2) setting the policy for crawling Docker images, and (3) setting the scalability options for obtaining a scalable architecture. In this paper, we also present 2 different use cases, ie, 2 different analysers of Docker images created by instantiating DockerAnalyser with 2 different analysis functions and configuration options. The 2 use cases show that DockerAnalyser decreases the effort required to obtain new analysers versus building them from scratch.},

abstract = {Summary The rapid progress of multi/many-core architectures has caused data-intensive parallel applications not yet fully optimized to deliver the best performance. In the advent of concurrent programming, frameworks offering structured patterns have alleviated developers' burden adapting such applications to multithreaded architectures. While some of these patterns are implemented using synchronization primitives, others avoid them by means of lock-free data mechanisms. However, lock-free programming is not straightforward, ensuring an appropriate use of their interfaces can be challenging, since different memory models plus instruction reordering at compiler/processor levels can interfere in the occurrence of data races. The benefits of race detectors are formidable in this sense; however, they may emit false positives if are unaware of the underlying lock-free structure semantics. To mitigate this issue, this paper extends ThreadSanitizer, a race detection tool, with the semantics of 2 lock-free data structures: the single-producer/single-consumer and the multiple-producer/multiple-consumer queues. With it, we are able to drop false positives and detect potential semantic violations. The experimental evaluation, using different queue implementations on a set of � benchmarks and real applications, demonstrates that it is possible to reduce, on average, 60\% the number of data race warnings and detect wrong uses of these structures.},

abstract = {Summary Cloud Functions, often called Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), pioneered by AWS Lambda, are an increasingly popular method of running distributed applications. As in other cloud offerings, cloud functions are heterogeneous due to variations in underlying hardware, runtime systems, as well as resource management and billing models. In this paper, we focus on performance evaluation of cloud functions, taking into account heterogeneity aspects. We developed a cloud function benchmarking framework, consisting of one suite based on Serverless Framework and one based on HyperFlow. We deployed the CPU-intensive benchmarks: Mersenne Twister and Linpack. We measured the data transfer times between cloud functions and storage, and we measured the lifetime of the runtime environment. We evaluated all the major cloud function providers: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, and IBM Cloud Functions. We made our results available online and continuously updated. We report on the results of the performance evaluation, and we discuss the discovered insights into resource allocation policies.},

abstract = {Summary In a typical data center, electrical energy is used to operate Information and Communication Technology (ICT) equipment and its supporting facilities. This chapter describes energy use that accelerates global warming and results in climate changes, flood, drought, and food shortage. It introduces strategic planning of data centers applying best practices in design and operations. Rapidly increasing electricity demand by data centers for information processing and mobile communications outpaces improvements in energy efficiency. The chapter addresses lessons learned from natural disasters. Training plays a vital role in successful energy-efficient design and safe operations. By collective effort, we can apply best practices to radically accelerate speed of innovation to plan, design, build, and operate data centers. In addition to natural disasters, terrorist attack to the Internet's physical infrastructure is vulnerable and could be devastating. It is imperative to have detailed business continuity (BC) and disaster recovery (DR) plans well prepared and executed.}

abstract = {Summary Cloud computing is an emerging computing paradigm that is changing software engineering. It offers scalable virtual compute resources at low prices, thus attracting many software developers interested in reducing their infrastructure and operational costs. Even though acquiring and using cloud solutions can be simple, a common difficulty developers face is how to best configure their applications at the architectural level, given a myriad of cloud services and resource types available, specially when considering different attributes such as cost, scalability, and performance. An inappropriate architectural decision can lead to a significant cost increase or a deployment option that does not meet the minimum required performance. This paper focuses on the problem of finding the best cloud deployment options for a given application that meet a given set of well-known nonfunctional requirements. To address this problem, the paper presents Cloud Application Architecture Appraiser (CA3), a multicriteria optimization approach and tool that relies on nonfunctional requirements as key drivers for assessing and selecting the best architectural options for deploying applications in the cloud. Results from the assessment of a real web application (WordPress), deployed using several different architectural options in a popular cloud provider (Amazon), are also presented to illustrate the use and benefits of the proposed method and tool.},

In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a new virtual storage system, Storage@desk, which can aggregate a large number of distributed machines within an organization to provide storage services with quality of service guarantees. Because storage virtualization is the prominent goal, Storage@desk provides clients with the abstraction of a hard drive by utilizing the Internet SCSI protocol. As such, data access to new storage services is transparent so that clients do not need to modify any existing applications nor change their current practices. Storage@desk replicates data and employs version-based journaling for high availability. It utilizes a market-based model for resource management and a feedback controller for automated performance control. We have developed a prototype of Storage@desk that implements the core components. Copyright � 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We contribute findings from several studies examining visualization sequencing and reception. In our first study, people made decisions between various possible structures as they ordered a set of related visualizations (consisting of either bar charts or thematic maps) into what they considered the clearest sequence for showing the data. We find that most people structure visualization sequences hierarchically: they create high level groupings based on shared data properties like time period, measure, level of aggregation, and spatial region, then order the views within these groupings. We also observe a tendency for certain types of similarities between views, like a common spatial region or aggregation level, to be seen as more appropriate categories for organizing views in a sequence than others, like a common time period or measure. In a second study, we find that viewers� perceptions of the quality and intention of different sequences are largely consistent with the perceptions of the users who created them. The understanding of sequence preferences and perceptions that emerges from our studies has implications for the development of visualization authoring tools and sequence recommendations for guided analysis.},

The assessment and monitoring of LCMS accessibility are vital for the guarantee of universal accessibility in education. This article presents a comparative study of the accessibility of three web-based, open-source LCMSs: Moodle, ATutor, and Sakai. Results of the study indicate that barriers to accessibility are present in each of the three systems evaluated. A primary aim of the study is to help detect and correct these barriers such that the goal of universal access in educational environments may one day be achieved. � 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Summary During the past five decades, computers have fundamentally transformed every aspect of aviation and aerospace. These impacts fall into three main classes. First, computing has completely transformed the design and manufacturing processes. Second, the advent of microprocessors with ever-increasing power has transformed the actual aircraft and spacecraft themselves, with computers taking over every aspect of the flight control and navigation systems. The third way in which computers have transformed aviation is that the major aspects of aircraft operations are now controlled by computing systems such as electronic reservation and ticketing systems and automatic check-in. This chapter discusses in detail each of these aspects. The development of digital Fly-By-Wire (FBW) systems has revolutionized the operation of both military and commercial aircraft. Computer systems are equally crucial to airline management and operations, and are also used for online flight tracking.}

abstract = {Summary Data-driven applications are essential to handle the ever-increasing volume, velocity, and veracity of data generated by sources such as the Web and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Simultaneously, an event-driven computational paradigm is emerging as the core of modern systems designed for database queries, data analytics, and on-demand applications. Modern big data processing runtimes and asynchronous many task (AMT) systems from high performance computing (HPC) community have adopted dataflow event-driven model. The services are increasingly moving to an event-driven model in the form of Function as a Service (FaaS) to compose services. An event-driven runtime designed for data processing consists of well-understood components such as communication, scheduling, and fault tolerance. Different design choices adopted by these components determine the type of applications a system can support efficiently. We find that modern systems are limited to specific sets of applications because they have been designed with fixed choices that cannot be changed easily. In this paper, we present a loosely coupled component-based design of a big data toolkit where each component can have different implementations to support various applications. Such a polymorphic design would allow services and data analytics to be integrated seamlessly and expand from edge to cloud to HPC environments.},

abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we describe a novel method to automatically generate synchronized dance motion that is perceptually matched to a given musical piece. The proposed method extracts 30 musical features from musical data as well as 37 motion features from motion data. A matching process is then performed between the two feature spaces considering the correspondence of the relative changes in both feature spaces and the correlations between musical and motion features. Similarity matrices are introduced to match the amount of relative changes in both feature spaces and correlation coefficients are used to establish the correlations between musical features and motion features by measuring the strength of correlation between each pair of the musical and motion features. By doing this, the progressions of musical and dance motion patterns and perceptual changes between two consecutive musical and motion segments are matched. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we designed and carried out a user opinion study to assess the perceived quality of the proposed approach. The statistical analysis of the user study results showed that the proposed approach generated results that were significantly better than those produced using a random walk through the dance motion database.

abstract = {Summary Networked Music Performance (NMP) systems involve musicians located in different places who perform music while staying synchronized via the Internet. The maximum end-to-end delay in NMP applications is called Ensemble Performance Threshold (EPT) and should be less than 25 milliseconds. Due to this constraint, NMPs require ultra�low-delay solutions for audio coding, network transmission, relaying, and decoding, each one a challenging task on its own. There are two directions for study in the related work referring to the NMP systems. From the audio perspective, researchers experiment on low-delay encoders and transmission patterns, aiming to reduce the processing delay of the audio transmission, but they ignore the network performance. On the other hand, network-oriented researchers try to reduce the network delay, which contributes to reduced end-to-end delay. In our proposed approach, we introduce an integration of dynamic audio and network configuration to satisfy the EPT constraint. The basic idea is that, the major components participating in an NMP system, the application and the network interact during the live music performance. As the network delay increases, the network tries to equalize it by modifying the routing behavior using Software-Defined Networking principles. If the network delay exceeds a maximum affordable threshold, the network reacts by informing the application to change the audio processing pattern to overcome the delay increase, resulting in below EPT end-to-end delay. A full prototype of the proposed system was implemented and extensively evaluated in an emulated environment.},

SPSC queues have been widely studied, mostly for applications such as streaming data or network monitoring, where the main goal is maximizing throughput. There are now many applications, such as virtual-machine�virtual-machine communication, software-defined networking, and message-based kernels, where low latency is also important, and the tradeoffs between high-throughput and low-latency algorithms have not been studied equally well. Furthermore, at high or variable transaction rates, the effect of memory hierarchies and cache coherence subsystems may be dominant and yield surprising results. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we provide a comprehensive study of the two main families of SPSC queues, namely, �Lamport� and �FastForward� queues, with a detailed analytical and experimental characterization of their behavior in terms of operating regimes, throughput, latency, and cache misses. Second, we propose two new queue variants, namely, improved FastForward and batched improved FastForward, which have better worst-case behavior than other variants in terms of cache misses, which is an important feature for a number of applications. Together, these two contributions provide practical guidelines to choose the best solution depending on the application requirements.},

abstract = {Abstract Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) have emerged recently as a technology for next-generation wireless networking. They consist of mesh routers and clients, where mesh routers are almost static and form the backbone of WMNs. WMNs provide network access for both mesh and conventional clients. In this paper, we propose DSA-Mesh, a fully distributed security architecture that provides access control for mesh routers as well as a key distribution scheme that supports layer-2 encryption to ensure security and data confidentiality of all communications that occur in the backbone of the WMN. DSA-Mesh exploits the routing capabilities of mesh routers: after connecting to the access network as generic wireless clients, new mesh routers authenticate to a key management service (consisting of several servers) implemented using threshold cryptography, and obtain a temporary key that is used both to prove their credentials to neighbor nodes and to encrypt all the traffic transmitted on wireless backbone links. A key feature in the design of DSA-Mesh is its independence from the underlying wireless technology used by network nodes to form the backbone. Furthermore, DSA-Mesh enables seamless mobility of mesh routers. Since it is completely distributed, DSA-Mesh permits to deploy automatically and incrementally large WMNs, while increasing, at the same time, the robustness of the system by eliminating the single point of failure typical of centralized architectures. DSA-Mesh has been implemented in Network Simulator, and extensive simulations have been performed in large-scale network scenarios, comparing it to a static key approach and to a centralized architecture where a single key server is deployed. Numerical results show that our proposed architecture considerably increases the WMN security and reliability, with a negligible impact on the network performance, thus representing an effective solution for wireless mesh networking.

In this article, we address a heuristic solution of the parallel drone scheduling traveling salesman problem, recently introduced by Murray and Chu. In this problem, deliveries are split between a vehicle and drones. The vehicle performs a classical delivery tour, while the drones are constrained to perform back and forth trips. The objective is to minimize completion time. We propose an iterative two-step heuristic, composed of: a coding step that transforms a solution into a customer sequence, and a decoding step that decomposes the customer sequence into a tour for the vehicle and trips for the drones. Decoding is expressed as a bicriteria shortest path problem and is carried out by dynamic programming. Experiments conducted on benchmark instances confirm the efficiency of the approach and give some insights on this drone delivery system.},

abstract = {Summary Distributed virtual environments provide a shared sense of time and space to geographically distributed users. They depend on a limited ability to ensure system nodes at different locations maintain consistent state data. This paper presents system models and algorithms designed to find optimal update scheduling parameters that minimize the effects of inconsistent simulation state data. The first model is concerned with ensuring distributed virtual environments that present a fair experience to all users while simultaneously providing adequate levels of system performance. In the second model, we introduce the concept of plausibility limits and address their use in ensuring all participants in an interaction to see the same result.},

The 2013 panel features panelists prepared to address audience questions on such topics as the traditional academic job market, alternative career paths including post-doctoral opportunities, the development of personal research agendas, and the challenges of online instruction. The function of this panel is to provide an interactive platform for faculty members at all stages of their careers to provide advice and input for doctoral students nearing the completion of their doctoral work. This panel will provide valuable insight on finishing the dissertation, weighing post-doctoral opportunities, entering the job market, and beginning an academic career. The format will allow participants to ask questions anonymously that may otherwise be embarrassing to ask. The panel will be of greatest use to those doctoral students at the end of their doctoral program, but, as proven in 2012, will also be of interest to doctoral students beginning their doctoral work and new assistant professors.},

abstract = {SUMMARY This paper discusses the applicability of agile methods to aircraft embedded software development. It presents the main results of an experiment that combines agile practices from Scrum with model-based development and distributed development. The experiment consists of the development of an aircraft cockpit display system divided in five distributed teams. Three features are analysed and quantified, using the output artefacts of each team: the artefacts' quality, the adherence to agile methods, and the adherence to standard DO-178C. The main conclusion of the experiment is that there is a high correlation between the adherence to agile methods and the artefacts' quality, motivating the use of agile methods in aircraft industry. Also, the experiment evinced that agile methods does not specifically address the integration of distributed teams and the hardware/software integration. This lacuna affects the artefacts' quality. The results of the experiment emphasize the importance of concentrating future work in the proposal of specific agile practices for these activities. Copyright � 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {SUMMARY This paper introduces a new process for a rigorous component-centered development of trustworthy systems. The rationale for our perspective of the process is two-fold. The activities prescribed in a conventional software engineering development process are neither suitable nor sufficient for developing component-based systems. Component-based development methods that are currently practised do not support the explicit specification of trustworthiness properties, and are not based on rigorous principles. Hence they are not suitable for developing trustworthy systems. Trustworthiness is regarded as a composite nonfunctional property comprising the four attributes safety, security, availability, and reliability. They must be rigorously defined for components and systems composed from them. It is essential that the process enforces a direct evidence of trustworthiness in the systems that are developed following the process. Consequently, the development process, in addition to being reuse-oriented, component-oriented, and rigorous in all phases of the system lifecycle, should maintain the chain of evidence that the trustworthiness properties are preserved in every activity of every phase of system development. The proposed process includes several parallel interrelated tracks including component development, component assessment, component reuse, and component-based system development and prescribes specific activities and tools for ensuring trustworthiness in all activities.

abstract = {Summary Low-power devices are usually highly constrained in terms of CPU computing power, memory, and GPGPU resources for real-time applications to run. In this paper, we describe RAPID, a complete framework suite for computation offloading to help low-powered devices overcome these limitations. RAPID supports CPU and GPGPU computation offloading on Linux and Android devices. Moreover, the framework implements lightweight secure data transmission of the offloading operations. We present the architecture of the framework, showing the integration of the CPU and GPGPU offloading modules. We show by extensive experiments that the overhead introduced by the security layer is negligible. We present the first benchmark results showing that Java/Android GPGPU code offloading is possible. Finally, we show the adoption of the GPGPU offloading into BioSurveillance, a commercial real-time face recognition application. The results show that, thanks to RAPID, BioSurveillance is being successfully adapted to run on low-power devices. The proposed framework is highly modular and exposes a rich application programming interface to developers, making it highly versatile while hiding the complexity of the underlying networking layer.},

In recent years, health care has become one of the most important services due to the continuous increases in its costs. This has motivated extensive research on health care CPS, and some of that research has focused on describing the software architecture behind these systems. However, there is no secondary study to consolidate the research. This paper aims to identify and compare existing research on software architectures for health care CPS in order to determine successful solutions that could guide other architects and practitioners in their health care projects. We conducted a systematic literature review and compared the selected studies based on a characterization schema. The research synthesis results in a knowledge base of software architectures for health care CPS, describing their stakeholders, functional and non-functional features, quality attributes architectural views and styles, components, and implementation technologies. This systematic literature review also identifies research gaps, such as the lack of open common platforms, as well as directions for future research.},

Then, we explore their recent applications to the criminal analytics domain, and discuss the challenges arising from these innovative applications. We also extend our study to big data analytics which provides some state-of-the-art technologies to reshape criminal investigations. In this paper, we review the recent literature, and examine the potentials of big data analytics for security intelligence under a criminal analytics framework. We examine some common data sources, analytics methods, and applications related to two important aspects of social network analysis namely, structural analysis and positional analysis that lay the foundation of criminal analytics. Another contribution of this paper is that we also advocate a novel criminal analytics methodology that is underpinned by big data analytics.

It makes it clear that the DFR should concentrate on the critical and major failures. This prevents us from solving easy problems and ignoring the complex ones.

The technologies stop the script kiddies, the ankle biters, the desultory attackers who don't really know what they're doing. The book also explains that the only way to maintain security in the face of the technological limitations is to build security processes. And that these security processes are not reasonable to build inside an organization, and will most likely be outsourced to cyberspace security professionals. Given that security is all about limiting risk, organizations need to trust entities that limit their risk. This means entities that come with insurance. Trusted entities will also have things like a proven track record, a good reputation, and independent certifications and audits.}

The Integrated Display System (IDS) design enables RSM to exploit existing data communications facilities, displays, global positioning system (GPS), ground surveillance system information, and data links. Since most air safety incidents occur on or near runways, the RSM plays a key role in accident avoidance. RSM is not intended to prevent incursions, but to detect them and alert the pilots.

However, fundamental advances in the computing and communications industry has has catalyzed the transformation of cloud computing from a mere plausibility to a hard-reality and a survival necessity, especially for small and medium business enterprises. It has fueled numerous business opportunities in service industry as well as innovation across verticals that were previously in the realm of beyond available computing resources. It is now time to embrace the dawn of such evolution to develop innovative solutions to address the ever-growing and seemingly unsurmountable challenge faced by the digital forensics community.}

Fly-by-wire (FBW) systems are built according to very strict requirements of dependability both in terms of safety (the system must not produce erroneous output signals) and availability. Most of these requirements come directly from official services. This chapter is structured around the threats to safety and system availability, namely: breakdowns due to physical failures, such as short-circuit or mechanical breakdown, errors in design and production, specific risks, such as engine explosion, and human-machine interface problems. For each threat, the chapter presents a summary of the applicable airworthiness requirements and a description of methods used on FBW Airbus, as well as the challenges and future trends.

abstract = {Summary The current mobile devices have become smart and are increasingly being used for conducting business and personal activities. Also, there is increasing number of attacks targeting such mobile devices. The term mobile botnet refers to group of mobile devices that are compromised and controlled by the attacker that can be used for generating distributed denial-of-service attacks. The security protocols that have been proposed for wireless and mobile networks have several weaknesses that can be exploited by the attacker to obtain unauthorized access and generate attacks. Also, there is growing number of malicious applications that are aimed to compromise smartphones and using them for generating different types of attacks. In this paper, we propose techniques to counteract distributed denial-of-service attacks on wireless mobile devices. We describe the operation and architectural components of our model. We will show that our model is able to efficiently deal with the attacks by dropping the attack traffic before it targets the victim mobile node, can prevent the attack traffic at the upstream nodes, and also deal with the attack cases that involve mobility of the attacking and victim nodes.

abstract = {Summary Cloud computing has grown to become a popular distributed computing service offered by commercial providers. More recently, edge and fog computing resources have emerged on the wide-area network as part of Internet of things (IoT) deployments. These three resource abstraction layers are complementary, and offer distinctive benefits. Scheduling applications on clouds has been an active area of research, with workflow and data flow models offering a flexible abstraction to specify applications for execution. However, the application programming and scheduling models for edge and fog are still maturing, and can benefit from learnings on cloud resources. At the same time, there is also value in using these resources cohesively for application execution. In this article, we offer a taxonomy of concepts essential for specifying and solving the problem of scheduling applications on edge, fog, and cloud computing resources. We first characterize the resource capabilities and limitations of these infrastructure and offer a taxonomy of application models, quality-of-service constraints and goals, and scheduling techniques, based on a literature review. We also tabulate key research prototypes and papers using this taxonomy. This survey benefits developers and researchers on these distributed resources in designing and categorizing their applications, selecting the relevant computing abstraction(s), and developing or selecting the appropriate scheduling algorithm. It also highlights gaps in literature where open problems remain.},

abstract = {Summary Statistical counter offers the appeal of an efficient and scalable counting mechanism on multi-core architectures where parallelism has been increasing sharply. Statistical counter has been widely used in practice (eg, in high-end network devices to count the number of packets received) despite the truth that it can only provide weak consistency guarantee on the counting results it returns, that is, statistical counter could miscount and the returned results may be inaccurate. As hardware and its parallelism advances, the miscount issue has raised concerns in both industry and academy. This paper is motivated by this real-world miscount issue that we were facing when building a high-speed intrusion detection system on a commercial multi-core server with 40Gbps NICs. To tackle the problem, we first systematically analyze the miscount issue and quantify the miscounts in counting results. Then, we present a novel counting algorithm that (1) is competitive to statistical counter in performance on multi-core architectures and (2) provides strong consistency guarantee on counting results returned. Experiments show that it takes the new counting algorithm 10ns and 1,500ns to perform an update and a read operation, respectively. Moreover, the counting results returned are accurate.},

abstract = {Abstract Vibration-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is one of the most popular solutions to assess the safety of civil infrastructure. SHM applications all begin with measuring the dynamic response of structures, but displacement measurement has been limited by the difficulty in requiring a fixed reference point, high cost, and/or low accuracy. Recently, researchers have conducted studies on vision-based structural health monitoring, which provides noncontact and efficient measurement. However, these approaches have been limited to stationary cameras, which have the challenge of finding a location to deploy the cameras with appropriate line-of-sight, especially to monitor critical civil infrastructures such as bridges. The Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) can potentially overcome the limitation of finding optimal locations to deploy the camera, but existing vision-based displacement measurement methods rely on the assumption that the camera is stationary. The displacements obtained by such methods will be a relative displacement of a structure to the camera motion, not an absolute displacement. Therefore, this article presents a framework to achieve absolute displacement of a structure from a video taken from an UAS using the following phased approach. First, a target-free method is implemented to extract the relative structural displacement from the video. Next, the 6 degree-of-freedom camera motion (three translations and three rotations) is estimated by tracking the background feature points. Finally, the absolute structural displacement is recovered by combining the relative structural displacement and the camera motion. The performance of the proposed system has been validated in the laboratory using a commercial UAS. Displacement of a pinned-connected railroad truss bridge in Rockford, IL subjected to revenue-service traffic loading was reproduced on a hydraulic simulator, while the UAS was flown from a distance of 4.6 m (simulating the track clearance required by the Federal Railroad Administration), resulting in estimated displacements with an RMS error of 2.14 mm.},

abstract = {Abstract A recurrent neural network (RNN) called CrackNet-R is proposed in the article for fully automated pixel-level crack detection on three-dimensional (3D) asphalt pavement surfaces. In the article, a new recurrent unit, gated recurrent multilayer perceptron (GRMLP), is proposed to recursively update the internal memory of CrackNet-R. Unlike the widely used long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), GRMLP is intended for deeper abstractions on the inputs and hidden states by conducting multilayer nonlinear transforms at gating units. CrackNet-R implements a two-phase sequence processing: sequence generation and sequence modeling. Sequence generation is specifically developed in the study to find the best local paths that are most likely to form crack patterns. Sequence modeling predicts timely probabilities of the input sequence being a crack pattern. In terms of sequence modeling, GRMLP slightly outperforms LSTM and GRU by using only one more nonlinear layer at each gate. In addition to sequence processing, an output layer is proposed to produce pixel probabilities based on timely probabilities predicted for sequences. The proposed output layer is critical for pixel-perfect accuracy, as it accomplishes the transition from sequence-level learning to pixel-level learning. Using 3,000 diverse 3D images, the training of CrackNet-R is completed through optimizing sequence modeling, sequence generation, and the output layer serially. The experiment using 500 testing pavement images shows that CrackNet-R can achieve high Precision (88.89\%), Recall (95.00\%), and F-measure (91.84\%) simultaneously. Compared with the original CrackNet, CrackNet-R is about four times faster and introduces tangible improvements in detection accuracy.},

abstract = {Summary Coupled scientific simulation workflows are composed of heterogeneous component applications that simulate different aspects of the physical phenomena being modeled and that interact and exchange significant volumes of data at runtime. As the data volumes and generation rates keep growing, the traditional disk I/O�based data movement approach becomes cost prohibitive, and workflow requires more scalable and efficient approach to support the data movement. Moreover, the cost of moving large volume of data over system interconnection network becomes dominating and significantly impacts the workflow execution time. Minimize the amount of network data movement and localize data transfers are critical for reducing such cost. To achieve this, workflow task placement should exploit data locality to the extent possible and move computation closer to data. In this paper, we investigate applying in-memory data staging and data-centric task placement to reduce the data movement cost in large-scale coupled simulation workflows. Specifically, we present a distributed data sharing and task execution framework that (1) co-locates in-memory data staging on application compute nodes to store data that needs to be shared or exchanged and (2) uses data-centric task placement to map computations onto processor cores that a large portion of the data exchanges can be performed using the intra-node shared memory. We also present the implementation of the framework and its experimental evaluation on Titan Cray XK7 petascale supercomputer.},

If one's new features have a new service associated with it the Service Interface Layer (SIL) will need to expose that service. The SIL will be responsible for routing the right app to the right version of the service. The Data Abstraction Layer (DAL) work would have been done prior to service deployment into testing and production. Depending on how one has built their DAL, some of the physical components may be deployed in the Service Layer (SL), and some in the Data Layer (DL).}

abstract = {Abstract This chapter covers how the Swift language is used in one of these cloud environments, namely event-driven, or server-less, environments. There are many other advantages to using microservices. Because the ideally designed microservice is small and focused in function, it is easier for developers to understand and troubleshoot. Inter-module communication can be more challenging, or at least require more careful consideration, in a microservices application. Monolithic applications can rely on fast in-process method invocations between modules, and they frequently evolve into rather “chatty- implementations. The key thing about serverless computing that makes it attractive to developers is that they can concentrate solely on application business logic development and avoid spending any time whatsoever dealing with infrastructure or application environment provisioning or deployment. OpenWhisk is an open source project that provides a distributed compute service to execute application logic in response to events. It delivers an event-driven platform within which one can execute code in response to the occurrence of some event.}

The chapter examines both technology-agnostic plays that everyone can adopt as needed and technology-speci?c plays that are tailored for speci?c technology-driven needs and constraints. Two-speed IT implies that some applications go faster, and others slower. Bimodal, on the other hand, implies that the requirements of applications are either stable or ever changing. Both of these classi?cation approaches are limited. The applications that deliver core business services have a lower risk tolerance and hence need to be on the optimization track. Innovative apps, on the other hand, have a higher risk tolerance. There is a set of core themes that have their roots in Lean and form the basis of most of the DevOps plays represented in this book. Before going into the plays themselves, it is essential to understand these themes and appreciate their importance as the core of DevOps. The ultimate goal of DevOps is to reduce waste to optimize the entire delivery pipeline.}

The enthusiasm and contributions from the Swift open technology community have produced really impressive and rapid growth in Swift-based code assets and frameworks. One of the goals for Swift is code consistency between client and server. Mobile application developers using Swift will have extensive familiarity with the Apple Xcode Integrated Developer Environment (IDE). In order to assist these developers with the creation of cloud-hosted Swift code, ICT for Swift complements a developer's familiar Xcode environment and therefore helps improve programmer productivity. One of several critical areas of evolution for Swift is building a solid foundation of server-side APIs needed for the next wave of cloud frameworks, microservices, and Swift-based server packages. A key aspect of enhancing the server-side frameworks is to untangle dependencies, adding the missing APIs that are not in the initial framework.}

The objective of NFV is to separate software that defines the virtualized network function (VNF) from hardware and generic software that creates a generic hosting network functions virtualization infrastructure (NFVI). This chapter focuses on the basic building blocks of NFV. ETSI working group has defined a few use cases for NFV. The chapter also introduces the high-level description of each use case in telecom network. NFV management and orchestration component, that is, management and network orchestration (MANO), is an integral piece of NFV architecture and a critical component to the success of NFV. According to ETSI's MANO working group, it contains three key components: the NFV orchestrator, VNF manager, and virtualized infrastructure manager (VIM). The chapter further discusses the challenges in virtualizing the NFs and using them in telecom network.}

It is important to establish a balance between the freedom of movement and the right of control through visas and passports of each State, under the principle of proportionality, intended to pursue travelers and migrants. European passports standardize the rules in the matter of biometrics, while limiting the freedom of movement. Since 2014, border police have been using drone devices to limit illegal immigration. Drones have worked with video surveillance. In the United States, there are multiple intelligent video surveillance projects. It includes TrapWire or INDECT, which use surveillance cameras, but also drones, armed, mostly, with biometric facial recognition technology, which can identify an individual according to size, age, and gender and skin color. The acceptance of surveillance drones poses the same political, sociological and legal questions as video protection.}

DGPS runs in a long wave radio frequency in the band 285 kHz to 325 kHz. It is commonly used for land and air navigation, marine radio in waterways. This chapter introduces different types of DGPS and AGPS. There are two types of DGPS: Real-time DGPS and Post-process DGPS. Real-time DGPS makes use of ground based stations to broadcast the difference between the actual position and estimated position from satellites' signals while post-process DGPS is based on the received position logs at a known location to calibrate the position. There are two major modes to assisted GPS known as Mobile Station Based (MSB) and Mobile Station Assisted (MSA) GPS. The chapter also covers the iPhone implementation about AGPS, compass and the map.

IPv6 provides improved internetworking capabilities compared with what is presently available with IPv4. �Autoconfiguration� is a new characteristic of the IPv6 protocol that facilitates network management and system setup tasks by users. The use of network - layer encryption mechanism nearly doubles IP operational overhead. Header Compression (HC) is, therefore, of interest. Obviously, streaming audio and video requires low latency and high throughput. Quality of service (QoS) is supported in IPv6. While the infrastructure is in place for IPv4 and IPv6 systems to run in parallel, widespread adoption of IPv6 has been slow because the two systems are not directly compatible, and there been so far rather limited economic incentive for providers and end-user firms to introduce the technology.

For many customers, it is nice to have a fully developed plan that you can follow throughout the project's lifetime. This chapter describes some indicators that mean a predictive project may be successful. The indicators include user involvement, clear vision, limited size, experienced team, and established technology. The chapter describes a few other things that might indicate a predictive project will not succeed: incomplete requirements, unclear requirements, changing requirements, and no resources. The chapter describes some predictive software development models such as waterfall model, waterfall with feedback, sashimi model, incremental waterfall model, V-model and software development life cycle. The incremental waterfall model uses a series of waterfalls. Each waterfall produces an increment, a new version of the application that is incrementally improved over the previous version.}

A handful of common service quality metrics that characterize application service quality are detailed. These user service key quality indicators (KQIs) are considered in depth. A simple cloud-based application with a pool of frontend components distributing work across a pool of backend components is illustrated. The chapter then focuses on two high-level application service boundaries: Application's customer facing service (CFS) boundary and Application's resource facing service (RFS) boundary. While different applications offer different functionality to end users, the primary service KQIs across the application's customer facing service boundary for end users of applications generally include one or more of the following: service availability; service latency; service reliability; service accessibility; service retainability; service throughput; service timestamp accuracy and application specific service quality measurements.}

Anti-hacking legislation is particularly a concern for companies that experience widespread theft of their trade secrets and other confidential information. The chapter discusses laws that provide government prosecutors with the ability to bring criminal charges against individuals who hack computers without authorization. The CFAA is the primary U.S. federal statute that prohibits and penalizes certain forms of computer hacking. Most states have similar anti-hacking laws that apply to hacking that occurs within their boundaries. Some state laws predate the CFAA, and often prohibit activities that are not addressed by the CFAA.}

Security tests verify that a control is functioning properly. These tests include automated scans, tool-assisted penetration tests, and manual attempts to undermine security. Security testing should take place on a regular schedule, with attention paid to each of the key security controls protecting an organization. The security team may wish to complement those automated scans with a manual penetration test performed by an external consultant for a significant fee. Those tests may occur on an annual basis to minimize costs and disruption to the business. Security assessments normally include the use of security testing tools but go beyond automated scanning and manual penetration tests. They also include a thoughtful review of the threat environment, current and future risks, and the value of the targeted environment. When conducting an audit or assessment, the team performing the review should be clear about the standard that they are using to assess the organization. The standard provides the description of control objectives that should be met, and then the audit or assessment is designed to ensure that the organization properly implemented controls to meet those objectives.}

Other question relates to Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT), a framework for information technology (IT) management and governance. The readers are asked as to which data management role is most likely to select and apply COBIT to balance the need for security controls against business requirements. Another question relates to an organization that regularly handles three types of data, including information that it shares with customers, information that it uses internally to conduct business, and trade secret information that offers the organization significant competitive advantages.}

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is trying to modernize its en route air traffic control (ATC) system for installation in air route traffic control centers (ARTCCs) throughout the country. One technical observation is included for your consideration. It seems that software engineering professionals have been striving for years to find ways to deal with increasing complexity. As part of their search, they have borrowed, without knowing it, �abstraction techniques� from the field of systems engineering and uniquely applied them to the field of software engineering.}
