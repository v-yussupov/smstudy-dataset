The absorption spectra were evaluated with respect to synthetic ligand concentration, time of complexation and pH. Therefore according the absorbance values, 0.015mmolL−1 BSIIOT, 10min after mixing and pH 8.0 were used as optimum values. The complex formation between BSIIOT ligand and the cations Cu2+ and Pb2+ by application of rank annihilation factor analysis (RAFA) were investigated. Daubechies-4 (db4), discrete Meyer (dmey), Morlet (morl) and Symlet-8 (sym8) continuous wavelet transforms for signal treatments were found to be suitable among the wavelet families. The applicability of new synthetic ligand and selected mother wavelets were used for the simultaneous determination of strongly overlapped spectra of species without using any pre-chemical treatment. Therefore, CWT signals together with zero crossing technique were directly applied to the overlapping absorption spectra of Cu2+ and Pb2+. The calibration graphs for estimation of Pb2+ and Cu 2+were obtained by measuring the CWT amplitudes at zero crossing points for Cu2+ and Pb2+ at the wavelet domain, respectively. The proposed method was validated by simultaneous determination of Cu2+ and Pb2+ ions in red beans, walnut, rice, tea and soil samples. The obtained results of samples with proposed method have been compared with those predicted by partial least squares (PLS) and flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (FAAS)."

Ionic complexes HPEP were formulated with varying reagent concentration, pH and time of color formation for completion of complexation reactions. It was found that, at 5.0×10−4molL−1 of HPEP, pH 9.5 and 10min after mixing the complexation reactions were completed. The spectral data were analyzed using partial response plots, and identified non-linearity modeled using FFNN. Reducing the number of OPA-FFNN and CWT-FFNN inputs were simplified using dissimilarity pure spectra of OPA and selected wavelet coefficients. Once the pure dissimilarity plots ad optimal wavelet coefficients are selected, different ANN models were employed for the calculation of the final calibration models. The performance of these two approaches were tested with regard to root mean square errors of prediction (RMSE %) values, using synthetic solutions. Under the working conditions, the proposed methods were successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of metal ions in different vegetable and foodstuff samples. The results show that, OPA-FFNN and CWT-FFNN were effective in simultaneously determining Fe3+, Mn2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ concentration. Also, concentrations of metal ions in the samples were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The amounts of metal ions obtained by the proposed methods were in good agreement with those obtained by FAAS."

This chapter presents Crew Resource Management (CRM) primarily from the perspective of the United States (US) regulatory system, administered by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA and other regulatory authorities around the world recognize the importance of CRM as a necessary and significant contributor to aviation safety. It opens up with a brief primer of the underlying philosophy of aviation regulation as a form of risk management. It describes the history and philosophical basis of some of the key aviation regulations in the US system. It then focuses on specific aspects of CRM—crew coordination and communication, error management, and flight crew monitoring. The chapter discusses how these aspects of CRM fit into the regulatory structure for equipment design, flight crew training, and flight crew procedures. A discussion of future examples is presented where implementation of CRM is important and concludes with a description of where regulatory material for resource management is applied to other areas besides flight crews. This propagation of resource management considerations throughout the regulatory material reflects the growing understanding of the importance of this area—but it needs to be even more widespread. Applications of CRM concepts to air traffic personnel, to the communication and coordination between pilots and ATS, among pilots, maintenance, dispatchers, cabin crew, and others remain important and can be improved even further."

abstract = "Background
The goals of surgical treatment of traumatic femoral artery aneurysm (FAA) are to isolate and excise the aneurysm, prevent distal embolization, and allow effective revascularization. During recent years, endovascular surgery has become a valid alternative to open repair. We aimed to compare early outcomes of the stent graft in the treatment of traumatic FAA and open surgical procedures.
Methods
This was a prospective study on 20 patients admitted to our hospital during the period from April 2016 to September 2017 with specific criteria of traumatic FAA. The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups with a one to one ratio between open repair (group I) and endovascular therapy (group II). We used the duplex scan in early follow-up 1 week and 1 month and 3 months postoperatively.
Results
Twenty FAAs were treated as follows: Excision of the aneurysm in patients of group I and repair by primary sutures or bypass with no graft failure occurred intraoperatively. Ten stents were placed in ten FAAs in group II. An early patency rate of 100% in 1 week was found in both groups, and thrombosis in 1 stent graft occurred after 1 month and 3 months (95%). The mean time of surgical operations was 107.5 min, and the mean time of endovascular procedures was 85 min. The group I had a significantly longer mean hospital stay time (8 days) than group II (4.25 days); P value < 0.05.
Conclusions
FAA treatment can be performed easily and safely by surgery or endovascular procedures. Although the endovascular approach has several advantages, the incidence of thrombosis and high cost of stent grafts should be considered."

The method is based on the fact that Cr(VI) and Mn(VII) oxyanions could be adsorbed on the Ni–Al(NO3−) LDH and/or exchanged with LDH interlayer NO3− ions at pH 6.0, whereas Cr(III) and Mn(II) cations pass through the LDH-packed column without retention. The determinations of total Cr and Mn, and hence indirectly Cr(III) and Mn(II), involve the pre-oxidations of Cr(III) and Mn(II) to Cr(VI) and Mn(VII) with H2O2 and acidic solution of KIO4, respectively. Several important factors affecting the retention efficiency were investigated and optimized.

The range of inhibition efficiency (IE) in 2 mol · L−1 HCl was found to be 75.88 % − 87.88% for Reax 88A, 10.72% − 60.32% for Reax 88B, and 51.32% − 63.03% for Reax 100M, after immersed at 298 K for 24 h time."

This review provides a comprehensive treatment of literature data dealing with asymmetric synthesis of FAAs via homologation of chiral and achiral Ni(II) complexes of glycine and alanine Schiff bases using fluorinated electrophilic reagents. The homologation approaches include: (1) alkyl halide alkylations; (2) aldol; (3) Michael and (4) Mannich addition reactions. Furthermore, Ni(II) complexes of Schiff bases of FAAs can be used for deracemization of racemic FAAs and (S) to (R) interconversion, providing additional synthetic opportunities for preparation of enantiomerically pure FAAs. Particular attention is given to the mechanistic considerations where fluorine can significantly influence the stereochemical outcome of the asymmetric transformation, as compared with the reactions of fluorine-free substrates. Aspects of practicality, cost-structure and large-scale synthesis of FAAs using this methodology are critically discussed."

To perform a complete characterization of PM2.5 and PM10 samples collected in Buenos Aires, Argentina black carbon, metals and metalloids were also determined. Due to the particularly complex chemical composition of atmospheric aerosols several analytical techniques were employed. Levoglucosan was extracted from filters and determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). It was detected in a wide range of concentrations, from 2.0ngm−3 to 4.90μgm−3 (PM2.5) and 6.0ngm−3 to 1.86μgm−3 (PM10). Equivalent black carbon concentrations were determined by reflectromety and varied between 3.3 and 8.9μgm−3. Other tracer of biomass burning such as Potassium was determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). Potassium was mainly detected in the coarse fraction varying from <0.56 to 3.51μgm−3. In addition, 17 minor, major and trace elements (Al, As, Ba, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn, Ti, V and Zn) were determined by plasma-based techniques namely, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

This study evaluates the concentrations of PGE in stream sediments of the Hex River, which drains the mining area of the Bushveld Igneous Complex (South Africa), at four sampling points. Major, minor and trace elements (Fe, Ca, Al, Mg, Mn, V, Cr, Zn, Cu, As, Co, Ni, Cd, and Pb) were analyzed by FAAS and ETAAS in suspended particulate matter and different sediment fractions (<63, 63–500 and 500–2000 μm), and Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ir were measured by ICP-MS after removal of interfering elements (cation exchange resin 50W-DOWEX-X8). Procedures were blank-corrected and accuracy checked using reference materials. Nickel, Cr, Pt, Pd, Rh and Ir show concentrations 3-, 13- 18-, 28-, 48- and 44- fold the typical upper continental crust levels, respectively, although lower than concentrations reported for the parent rocks. The highest concentrations were observed closer to the mining area, decreasing with distance and in the <63 μm fraction, probably derived from atmospheric deposition and surface runoff of PGE-rich particles released from mining activities. Thus, mining activities are causing some disturbance of the surface PGE geochemical cycle, increasing the presence of PGE in the fine fraction of river sediments. We propose that indicators such as airborne particulate matter, and soil and river sediment quality, should be added to the protocols for evaluating the sustainability of mining activities."

The limits of detections (3 × sblank/m, n:10) were 0.3 μg L−1 for Ni(II) and 0.2 μg L−1 for Co(II) with relative standard deviation <3.1% for real samples. The method was validated by analysis of two standard reference materials (SRMs), and recovery tests based on spiking at two levels. Lastly, the method was reliably applied for the determination of trace Ni and Co in chocolate-based samples, with amounts in range of 1.5–192.7 μg L−1 and in range of 3.8–152 μg L−1, respectively."

The method is based on ion-pair formation between anionic citrate chelates of each analyte and triphenylmethane group dicationic dye, Methyl green (MeG2+) at pH 5.5, and then extraction of the formed complexes into micro-drops of extraction solvent. Natural deep eutectic solvent (NADES) as extraction solvent was easily synthesized by mixing citric acid-sucrose at mole ratio of 3:2, and used in extraction process. Some parameters affecting extraction efficiency were studied and optimized in detail. Under the optimum conditions, good linear working ranges (0.9–1050 μg kg−1 for Cu, 1.5–675 μg kg−1 for Cd, and 3–1200 μg kg−1 for Pb) was obtained when considered 0.5 g of sample and 1.5 mL of the pre-treated sample solution after dilution of 5-fold for Cd and 25-fold for Cu and Pb, and the limits of detection and quantification were in the range of 0.23–0.87 and 0.78–2.94 μg kg−1 for the analytes, respectively. From analysis results, it was observed that the accuracy (as recovery %), and intra-day/inter-day precision (as relative standard deviation%) were in the range of 90.3–98.4% and 2.0–5.2%, respectively. The method was statistically validated by analysis of a certified reference material. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of low levels of Cu, Cd and Pb in selected honey samples."

They are primarily utilized for the synthesis of seed-storage proteins, but also serve as precursors for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and as a source of energy. Here, we aimed at describing the knowledge accumulated in recent years describing the changes occurring in the contents of free amino acids (FAAs) during seed development. Since several essential amino acids are found in low levels in seeds (e.g., Lys, Met, Thr, Val, Leu, Ile and His), or play unique functional roles in seed development (e.g., Pro and the non-proteinogenic γ-aminobutyrate [GABA]), we also briefly describe studies carried out in order to alter their levels in seeds and determine the effects of the manipulation on seed biology. The lion share of these studies highlights strong positive correlations between the biosynthetic pathways of FAAs, meaning that when the levels of a certain amino acid change in seeds, the contents of other FAAs tend to elevate as well. These observations infer a tight regulatory network operating in the biosynthesis of FAAs during seed development."

Characterization of the prepared adsorbent was carried out using various techniques such as XRD, FT-IR, SEM, EDS mapping and BET analyses. Central composite design (CCD) under response surface methodology (RSM) was used for obtaining the most important parameters and probable interactions between variables. In this favor, parameters including adsorbent dosage, pH, adsorption time and desorption time using ultrasound were optimized. Sonication had an important role in shortening the adsorption and desorption times of lead (II) and cadmium (II) ions by enhancing the dispersion of adsorbent in solution. Under optimum conditions, the proposed method represented linear ranges of 2.0–130.0 and 5.0–150.0 μg l−1 for lead and cadmium, respectively; while their corresponding values for limit of detection (LOD) using this method were found to be 0.93 and 1.08 μg l−1.

abstract = "An efficient, innovative preconcentration method, dual-cloud point extraction (d-CPE) has been developed for the extraction and preconcentration of copper (Cu2+) in serum samples of different viral hepatitis patients prior to couple with flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The d-CPE procedure was based on forming complexes of elemental ions with complexing reagent 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphthol (PAN), and subsequent entrapping the complexes in nonionic surfactant (Triton X-114). Then the surfactant rich phase containing the metal complexes was treated with aqueous nitric acid solution, and metal ions were back extracted into the aqueous phase, as second cloud point extraction stage, and finally determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry using conventional nebulization. The multivariate strategy was applied to estimate the optimum values of experimental variables for the recovery of Cu2+ using d-CPE. In optimum experimental conditions, the limit of detection and the enrichment factor were 0.046μgL−1 and 78, respectively. The validity and accuracy of proposed method were checked by analysis of Cu2+ in certified sample of serum (CRM) by d-CPE and conventional CPE procedure on same CRM. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of Cu2+ in serum samples of different viral hepatitis patients and healthy controls."

The Al3+ was complexed with 8-hydrooxyquinoline (oxine) (L1) and 3,5,7,2′-4′ pentahydroxy flavone (morin) (L2) separately and then extracted by IL at temperature (50±2.0°C). Some effective factors that influence the TIL-DLLME efficiency such as pH, ligands concentrations, volume of IL, ionic strength, and incubation time were investigated and optimized by multivariate analysis. In the optimum experimental conditions, the limit of detection (3s) and enhancement factor were 0.56μgL−1, 0.64μgL−1 and 85, 73 for both ligands, respectively. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for six replicate determinations of 100μgL−1 Al3+ complexed with oxine and morin were found to be 3.88% and 4.74%, respectively. The developed method was validated by the analysis of certified reference material of human hair (NCSZC81002).and applied satisfactorily to the determination of Al3+ in acid digested scalp hair samples of AD patients and healthy controls. The resulted data shows significant higher level in scalp hair samples of AD male patients with related to referents of same age and socioeconomic status."

Consumer-grade GPS units without differential correction have a published horizontal positional accuracy of approximately 10–15m (average positional accuracy). An attractive option for differential correction for these GPS units is the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS). Most consumer-grade GPS units on the market are WAAS capable. According to the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), the WAAS broadcast message provides integrity information about the GPS signal as well as accuracy improvements, which are reported to improve accuracy to 3–5m. Limited empirical evidence has been published on the accuracy of WAAS-enabled GPS compared to autonomous GPS. An empirical study was conducted comparing the horizontal and vertical accuracy of WAAS-corrected GPS and autonomous GPS under ideal conditions using consumer-grade receivers. Data were collected for 30-min time spans over accurately surveyed control points. Metrics of median, 68th and 95th percentile, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and average positional accuracy in the horizontal and vertical dimensions were computed and statistically compared. No statistically significant difference was found between WAAS and autonomous position fixes when using two different consumer-grade units. When using WAAS, a third unit type exhibited a statistically significant improvement in positional accuracy. Analysis of data collected for a 27-h time span indicates that while WAAS is altering the estimated position of a point compared to an autonomous position estimate, WAAS augmentation actually appears to decrease the positional accuracy."

To determine whether EEG occipital alpha and frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) distinguishes outpatients with major depression (MDD) from controls, predicts antidepressant treatment outcome, and to explore the role of gender.
Methods
In the international Study to Predict Optimized Treatment in Depression (iSPOT-D), a multi-center, randomized, prospective open-label trial, 1008 MDD participants were randomized to escitalopram, sertraline or venlafaxine-extended release. The study also recruited 336 healthy controls. Treatment response was established after eight weeks and resting EEG was measured at baseline (two minutes eyes open and eyes closed).
Results
No differences in EEG alpha for occipital and frontal cortex, or for FAA, were found in MDD participants compared to controls. Alpha in the occipital and frontal cortex was not associated with treatment outcome. However, a gender and drug-class interaction effect was found for FAA. Relatively greater right frontal alpha (less cortical activity) in women only was associated with a favorable response to the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors escitalopram and sertraline. No such effect was found for venlafaxine-extended release.
Conclusions
FAA does not differentiate between MDD and controls, but is associated with antidepressant treatment response and remission in a gender and drug-class specific manner.
Significance
Future studies investigating EEG alpha measures in depression should a-priori stratify by gender."

To curb the growth of GHG emissions from air travel, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has created a policy to achieve carbon neutral growth by 2020 relative to the 2005 baseline. If the airline industry is to both grow and meet the objectives set by this policy, new and innovative aircraft designs, operational efficiencies, and widespread use of alternate fuels are required. To accomplish this would require large research and development investment. The federal government and state governments have passed legislations that provide tax breaks and other incentives to encourage investments in new technologies. One such tax policies is cap and trade system. This had partial success in reducing GHG emissions in certain industries but was not successful in the airline industry. This paper presents alternate methods to raise capital to invest in GHG emissions reduction projects in the airline sector. The four methodologies presented here monetizes the GHG emissions resulting from differences in load factor (ratio of number of passengers to number of seats) and GHG emissions per passenger-mile among different airlines, among different flight sectors, etc. to raise the capital. Based on 2012 air travel data, these methodologies could raise more than $300 million dollars annually to invest in GHG emissions reduction projects."

abstract = "The National Airspace System (NAS) Enterprise Architecture (EA) describes Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) goals, operational changes, planned infrastructure changes, and guidance materials. While the primary focus of the NAS EA is on infrastructure delivery, one of the main functions of human factors is to proactively assess and respond to the anticipated impacts of NextGen changes on end-users. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Human Factors Research and Engineering Division (ANG-C1) has strengthened the presence of human factors activities in NextGen products through the Human Systems Integration (HSI) Roadmap and other NAS EA Roadmaps. This paper will present the en route air traffic control (ATC) portion of the HSI Roadmap and explore potential NextGen human factors integration opportunities to support future en route operations. Opportunities have been identified through the analysis of operational improvements (OIs), decision points, and information obtained through stakeholder interviews. When examining the en route domain, 52 OI-actor pairings were identified with 14 describing automation enhancing situation awareness, 3 describing procedural changes, and 35 describing mixed changes."

abstract = "High pressure (HP) offers potential industrial applications in cheese preservation, but it is essential to provide knowledge concerning their effects on the ripening process and sensory characteristics. In this study, we investigated the effect of different HP treatments (200–500MPa at 14°C for 10min on day 7) on proteolysis, texture, colour, volatile compounds and sensory characteristics of semi-hard raw ewe milk cheese. HP treatments did not affect pH or dry matter values of 60-day-old cheeses. Treatments at pressure levels up to 400MPa led to significant (P<0.01) increases in the total free amino acids (FAA) content at 60days, compared to control cheese, although the cell-free aminopeptidase activity was lower. HP retarded the formation of some volatile compounds in cheeses, the number of compounds affected by HP being higher as the pressure level increased. Cheeses pressurized at 300–500MPa had lower levels of 2-butanone, 2-butanol, 2-propen-1-ol, 1-butanol and acetic acid than control cheese, cheeses pressurized at 400–500MPa lower levels of 1-propanol, 2-pentanol, and butyric and hexanoic acids, and cheeses pressurized at 500MPa lower levels of ethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol and 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol. All HP-treated cheeses showed higher fracturability values, and higher Hue angle and lower a* values than control cheese. Despite the differences detected by instrumental analyses between HP-cheeses and control cheese, few significant differences were found between the sensory characteristics of HP-cheeses and control cheese. Only the pressurization of cheese at 500MPa affected significantly (P<0.01) some of the sensory characteristics, with a negative effect on taste intensity but a positive effect on aroma quality. In summary, HP treatments at 200 and 300MPa showed the mildest effects on the characteristics of semi-hard raw ewe milk cheese. HP treatment of this cheese variety at 300, 400 and 500MPa prevented late blowing defect caused by Clostridium tyrobutyricum (Ávila et al., 2016, Food Microbiol. 60, 165–173). Thus, it may be concluded that HP treatment at 300MPa is the most adequate procedure, able to prevent late blowing with minimum changes in cheese characteristics."

abstract = "Biodiesel is considered an alternative energy because it is produced from fats and vegetable oils by means of transesterification. Furthermore, it consists of fatty acid alkyl esters (FAAS) which have a great influence on biodiesel fuel properties and in the storage lifetime of biodiesel itself. The biodiesel storage stability is directly related to the oxidative stability parameter (Induction Time – IT) which is determined by means of the Rancimat® method. This method uses condutimetric monitoring and induces the degradation of FAAS by heating the sample at a constant temperature. The European Committee for Standardization established a standard (EN 14214) to determine the oxidative stability of biodiesel, which requires it to reach a minimum induction period of 6h as tested by Rancimat® method at 110°C. In this research, we aimed at developing a fast and simple alternative method to determine the induction time (IT) based on the FAAS ultrasonic-accelerated oxidation. The sonodegradation of biodiesel samples was induced by means of an ultrasonic homogenizer fitted with an immersible horn at 480Watts of power and 20 duty cycles. The UV–Vis spectrometry was used to monitor the FAAS sonodegradation by measuring the absorbance at 270nm every 2. Biodiesel samples from different feedstock were studied in this work. In all cases, IT was established as the inflection point of the absorbance versus time curve. The induction time values of all biodiesel samples determined using the proposed method was in accordance with those measured through the Rancimat® reference method by showing a R2=0.998."

The present study was investigated to employ ashes of Sırnak BCW (burned coal waste) as an ion exchange in removal of important toxic metal, Lead (Pb), in high yields by adsorption. The ion exchange characteristics of lead onto BCW from aqueous solution were investigated with respect to the changes in pH of solution, adsorbent dosage, initial metal ion concentration, contact time and temperature of solution. For the adsorption of lead, the Langmuir isotherm model fitted to equilibrium data better than the Freundlich isotherm model. Thermodynamic functions, the change of free energy (ΔG°), enthalpy (ΔH°) and entropy (ΔS°) of adsorption were also calculated for lead. These parameters showed that the adsorption was feasible, spontaneous and exothermic at 293–333K. Experimental data were also evaluated in terms of kinetic characteristics of adsorption. The batch kinetic data were correlated to the pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order models. The data fitted better to the pseudo-second order equation. The activation energy of systems was determined. Experimental data have shown that BCW that was used in unmodified form; as low cost, readily available ion exchange; can be used for removal of lead from industrial waste waters. Analysis was determined using Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (FAAS)."

The washed sludges have been precalcined in a rotary furnace at 900°C and fritted at three different temperatures of 850°C, 900°C and 950°C. The amounts of additives were adjusted to provide different acidic and basic oxide ratios in the precalcined sludge-additive mixtures. Leaching tests were conducted according to the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure Method 1311 of US-EPA. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS) and flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) have been used to determine the physical and chemical changes in the products. Calculated oxide molar ratios in the precalcined sludge-additive mixtures and their leaching results have been used to optimize the stabilization process and to determine the intervals of the required oxide ratios which provide end-products resistant to leaching procedure of US-EPA. The developed immobilization-process provides lower energy consumption than sintering-vitrification processes of glass–ceramics."

Due to mixture between honeys, authentication is an important aspect of quality control and its regard with the origin guarantee in terms of source and geographical documentation needs to be determined. We therefore determined the free amino acids (FAA) by GC-MS to elucidate the contribution of plant-sucking insects (Tachardiella sp.) and Apis mellifera bees to the Bhh in order to classify this honey from five different geographic areas of Santa Catarina, using chemometric approach. The results showed that proline is provided exclusively by Apis mellifera bees, and this honey could be differentiated into geographic regions based on the FAA profile. Principal component analysis identified the main FAA responsible for clustering of the samples in these regions (the sum of the first 2 principal components account for 82% of the total variance) and provided a similar discrimination of the geographical location map, particularly with regard to the northern and southern geographical orientations. This method is therefore a reliable analytical strategy for the authentication of this honey."

OA increased with increasing stress period up to 33 days and the increase was more rapid in the high OA (HOA) genotypes. HOA genotypes also had higher leaf RWC and ELWRC and maintained higher leaf water potentials (Ψl) compared to LOA genotypes under water deficit. Genotypes with HOA accumulated greater levels of proline, total soluble sugars (TSS), total free amino acids (FAA) and potassium than those with LOA in response to water deficit. Contribution of TSS was the maximum (61%), compared to FAA (17%), proline (12%) and potassium (2.8%) to the Ψs at 33 days after imposing water deficit indicating that sugars were the major contributors towards OA in castor leaves. A positive relationship existed between OA of expanded leaf 33 days after imposing stress (r=0.8539) and total seed yield under water-limited conditions in various castor genotypes tested and HOA genotypes had higher total seed yield than genotypes with LOA. Genotype variability exists for OA and it is a heritable trait in castor. Hybrids followed their superior parents in terms of OA. HOA genotypes of castor produced significantly higher seed yield than LOA genotypes. Accumulation of TSS contributed largely to the OA in castor."

Current approaches include antiangiogenic drugs, which prevent growth of new vessels, and tumor vascular disrupting drugs, which further compromise the function of tumor vasculature and induce vascular failure. Preclinical studies have led to the development of the two main classes of tumor vascular disrupting agent—tubulin polymerization inhibitors such as combretastatin A4 phosphate (CA4P) and the flavonoid class that includes flavone acetic acid (FAA) and ASA404 (vadimezan). Each class of drug has shown antitumor activity in preclinical models of lung cancer, including both rodent tumors and human tumor xenografts. Tubulin polymerization inhibitors act primarily by disrupting the tubulin network of the endothelial cell cytoskeleton, leading to shape changes and increased vascular permeability, but these agents also affect the actin cytoskeleton and endothelial cell junctions. Flavonoid vascular disrupting agents appear to accentuate pathologic signaling by cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, leading to changes in the actin cytoskeleton, increased vascular permeability, and endothelial apoptosis. Several approaches to the measurement of vascular disrupting effects in preclinical models have been developed. They include measurement of tumor blood flow, the induction of tumor hypoxia, and the release of serotonin from platelets, measured in plasma as the metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Both classes of agent combine with standard cytotoxic drugs in the treatment of experimental tumors, but consideration of the timing of combination administration is important because tumor vascular disruption will affect delivery of a second agent."

Solvent extraction and Fe (III) precipitation with addition of NH3 assisted in minimizing the interference by eliminating Fe and other gangue minerals. Before solvent extraction and Fe (III) precipitation, the FAAS gold analysis result for HG sample was 3.18g/t and gold was not detected for LG sample.

abstract = "β-Type titanium alloys with a low elastic modulus are a potential strategy to enhance bone remodeling and to mitigate the concern over the risks of osteanabrosis and bone resorption caused by stress shielding, when used to substitute irreversibly impaired hard tissue. Hence, in this study, a Ti–45Nb alloy with low Young's modulus and high strength was developed, and microstructure, mechanical properties, corrosion behaviors, cytocompatibility and in vivo osteo-compatibility of the alloy were systematically investigated for the first time. The results of mechanical tests showed that Young's modulus of the Ti–Nb alloy was reduced to about 64.3GPa (close to human cortical bone) accompanied with higher tensile strength and hardness compared with those of pure Ti. Importantly, the Ti–Nb alloy exhibited superior corrosion resistance to Ti in different solutions including SBF, MAS and FAAS (MAS containing NaF) media. In addition, the Ti–Nb alloy produced no deleterious effect to L929 and MG-63 cells, and cells performed excellent cell attachment onto Ti–Nb surface, indicating a good in vitro cytocompatibility. In vivo evaluations indicated that Ti–Nb had comparable bone tissue compatibility to Ti determined from micro-CT and histological evaluations. The Ti–Nb alloy with an elasticity close to human bone, thus, could be suitable for orthopedic/dental applications."

We assessed food intake microstructure and meal pattern, and locomotor activity and rearing as markers of food anticipatory activity (FAA). Schedule fed mice reduced their caloric intake from control diet during the first hours of the dark phase but not during the 3-h period immediately preceding the scheduled feed. Large meal/binge-like eating behaviour during the 2-h scheduled feed was characterised by increases in both meal number and meal size. Rearing was increased during the 2-h period running up to scheduled feeding while locomotor activity started to increase 1 h before, indicating that schedule-fed mice display FAA. Meal number and physical activity changes were sustained when HFD was withheld during the anticipated scheduled feeding period, and mice immediately binged when HFD was represented after a week of this “withdrawal” period. These findings provide important context to our previous studies suggesting that energy balance systems in the hypothalamus are not responsible for driving these large, binge-type meals. Evidence of FAA in HFD dark phase schedule-fed mice implicates anticipatory processes in binge eating that do not involve immediately preceding hypophagia or regulatory homeostatic signalling."

Several parameters affecting the extraction efficiency of the procedure were investigated including the type and concentrations of surfactant, the concentration of HNO3, and the other operational conditions (emulsion breaking time and temperature). The limits of detection of 1.1 and 1.0μgL−1 were observed for zinc when aqueous standard and oil-based standards were added to the emulsions for calibration, respectively.

PepT1 mRNA expression was assessed in pyloric caeca (S1) and the remainder of the intestine divided into four equally long segments (S2–S5). PepT1 transcripts were found in all segments, indicating that the whole intestine is involved in peptide absorption. Differences in the regional expression profile of PepT1 were found. Under control diet (FM diet) conditions, fish exhibited a reduced expression in S5 compared to S2. In fish fed FAA and UFR diets, PepT1 mRNA levels were higher in S2 and S3 compared to other regions. These data suggest that PepT1 may be variably recruited along the whole intestine, including the most distal part, in response to changes in the luminal protein source content. This adaptive response might be functional to keep a maximal efficiency of protein absorption at the intestinal level."

This in turn results in inefficient use of airline resources such as aircraft, crew, and ground personnel. Taxi-out time prediction is also a first step in enabling schedule modifications that would help mitigate congestion and reduce emissions. The dynamically changing operation at the airport makes it difficult to accurately predict taxi-out time. In this paper we investigate the accuracy of taxi out time prediction using a nonparametric reinforcement learning (RL) based method, set in the probabilistic framework of stochastic dynamic programming. A case-study of Tampa International Airport (TPA) shows that on an average, with 93.7% probability, on any given day, our predicted mean taxi-out time for any given quarter, matches the actual mean taxi-out time for the same quarter with a standard error of 1.5min. Also, for individual flights, the taxi-out time of 81% of them were predicted accurately within a standard error of 2min. The predictions were done 15min before gate departure. Gate OUT, wheels OFF, wheels ON, and gate IN (OOOI) data available in the Aviation System Performance Metric (ASPM) database maintained by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was used to model and analyze the problem. The prediction accuracy is high even without the use of detailed track data."

The present paper deals with the taxonomy, anatomy, powder study pertaining to organoleptic, microscopic, and physical constant evaluations of Amaranthus spinosus Linn (Amaranthaceae). It is a glabrous herb found in tropical and sub-tropical regions of India. The decoction of the leaves is diuretic and febrifuge. Leaves and stems are also used for treating eye diseases and diabetes. Methods: In the present study macroscopic, microscopic, ash values and extractive values were carried out to develop the diagnostic parameters for quality control of leaf and stem. The required samples of different organs were cut and removed from the plant and fixed in FAA (Formalin - 5 ml + acetic acid - 5ml + 70% Ethyl alcohol - 90ml). After 24 hrs of fixing, the specimens were dehydrated with graded series of tertiary - butyl alcohol. The specimens were castled into paraffin blocks. Results: Powder showed epidermal cell, anamocytic stomata, calcium oxalate crystals and cross section of leaf and stem showed the bundle sheath cells, median bundle, phloem fibers, vessels, periderm, secondary xylem and pith. Phytochemically, the methanol and aqueous extracts of A. spinosus showed maximum phytochemicals like alkaloids, glycosides, steroids, flavonoids, saponin, tannin and phenolic compounds, terpenoids, carbohydrates, etc. The average extractive values of leaf and stem can also be used for determine the quality of raw material of A. spinosus. Conclusion: The results of this study should provide a standard for identification and preparation of monograph of this drug."

abstract = "Introduction
This study provides new public health data concerning the US commercial air tour industry. Risk factors for fatality in air tour crashes were analyzed to determine the value of the FIA Score in predicting fatal outcomes.
Methods
Using the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) General Aviation and Air Taxi Survey and National Transportation Safety Board data, the incidence of commercial air tour crashes from 2000 through 2010 was calculated. Fatality risk factors for crashes occurring from 2000 through 2011 were analyzed using regression methods. The FIA Score, Li and Baker's fatality risk index, was validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.
Results
The industry-wide commercial air tour crash rate was 2.7 per 100,000 flight hours. The incidence rates of Part 91 and 135 commercial air tour crashes were 3.4 and 2.3 per 100,000 flight hours, respectively (relative risk [RR] 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–2.1, P=0.015). Of the 152 air tour crashes that occurred from 2000 through 2011, 30 (20%) involved at least one fatality and, on average, 3.5 people died per fatal crash. Fatalities were associated with three major risk factors: fire (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 5.1, 95% CI 1.5–16.7, P=0.008), instrument meteorological conditions (AOR 5.4, 95% CI 1.1–26.4, P=0.038), and off-airport location (AOR 7.2, 95% CI 1.6–33.2, P=0.011). The area under the FIA Score's ROC curve was 0.79 (95% CI 0.71–0.88).
Discussion
Commercial air tour crash rates were high relative to similar commercial aviation operations. Disparities between Part 91 and 135 air tour crash rates reflect regulatory disparities that require FAA action. The FIA Score appeared to be a valid measurement of fatal risk in air tour crashes. The FIA should prioritize interventions that address the three major risk factors identified by this study."

Firstly, the effect on FAA composition during growth was assessed and it was found that the composition of total free amino acids (TFAA) and individual FAA changed dramatically during growth of the seeds to the seedling at 7days with the highest content of TFAA. Secondly, 7-day-old seedlings were HP-treated at various pressure levels (200–800MPa for 3min at 5°C). As expected the HP-treatment did not affect the amino acids as no changes in TFFA were found immediately after pressurisation. In this line, HP-treatment up to 800MPa had minor, but significant, effect on the FAA concentrations of 10 FAA (Ala, Asp, Glu, Gly, Leu, Phe, Pro, Ser, Trp and Tyr) and no significant changes were found for 7 of the FAA (Asn, Gln, His, Ile, Lys, Thr, and Val) concluding that the short pressure time (3min) was insufficient to activate indigenous proteolytic enzymes. Furthermore, changes in the FAA content and composition of HP-treated seedlings during storage (0, 1, 2, and 4days at 4±2°C) were evaluated in order to assess changes in the proteolytic enzyme activity. It was found that the changes in FAA differed according to the specific amino acids as well as the HP processing conditions and the subsequent storage time. These results suggest that HP treatment affects proteolysis and/or certain amino acids metabolism pathways in Brussels sprouts seedlings after HP treatment and during subsequent storage."

This work aimed to look for a standardized histological technique and to develop a protocol for histological studies of foliose Parmeliaceae under light microscopy. Four common pantropical species of Parmeliaceae, abundant in the Brazilian cerrado vegetation, were processed in several ways in relation to fixing and inclusion media, sectioning thicknesses, and staining, including both fresh and 2-year-old herbarium specimens. The best technique found for anatomical studies of Parmeliaceae under light microscopy is represented by 2 or 3μm thick sections of fresh or herbarium samples, desiccated and fixed in FAA 50, infiltrated and embedded in glycol-methacrylate resin (Leica), and stained by Toluidine Blue or Methylene Blue."

The present study evaluates the pesticides Atrazine and Roundup (glyphosate) on biochemical and molecular aspects of Biomphalaria alexandrina snails. The results showed that LC10 of these two pesticides caused considerable reduction in survival rates and egg production of treated snails. Additionally, Atrazine proved to be more toxic to B. alexandrina snails than Roundup. In treated snails, glucose concentration (GL) in the hemolymph as well as lactate (LT) and free amino acid (FAA) in soft tissues of treated snails increased while glycogen (GN), pyruvate (PV), total protein (TP), nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) levels in snail’s tissues decreased. The activities of glycogen phosphorylase (GP), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR), succinic dehydrogenase (SDH), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and phosphatases (ACP and ALP) enzymes in homogenate of snail’s tissues were reduced in response to the treatment with the two pesticides while lipid peroxide (LP) and transaminases (GOT and GPT) activity increased (P<0.001). The changes in the number, position and intensity of DNA bands induced by pesticides may be attributed to the fact that pesticide can induce genotoxicity through DNA damage. It was concluded that the pollution of the aquatic environment by Atrazine and Roundup pesticides, would adversely affect the metabolism of the B. alexandrina snails, and have adverse effects on its reproduction."

Yet, the mineral composition of this species is still poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify the content of essential elements in edible tissues of specimens from the Scottish Coast and English Channel and to compare such values with the Dietary Reference Intakes. Crabs caught off Scottish Coast had higher Na, Cl, K, Cu, Zn and Se content, while specimens harvested in the English Channel showed higher Mn concentrations. Females were better sources of Cu, Zn and Se, whereas males had higher concentrations of Na, Cl, K, Ca and Mn. Hepatopancreas showed higher contents of most elements, except Mn, Zn and Se than muscle and gonads. These results are certainly related to the crabs’ physiological needs and the bioavailability of the elements in water and diet. In general, C. pagurus is an excellent source of macro (Na, Cl and Ca) and trace elements (Fe, Cu, Zn and Se) for human consumption. The present study highlights the importance to take into consideration all edible tissues of crustaceans to evaluate their nutritional quality given consumers’ habits."

There was a significant effect (P < 0.0001) between all interaction groups on FAA profile and BAs formation in lupin seeds. Solid state fermentation showed a higher effectiveness in comparison to submerged due to lower total BAs contents in most samples. Optimization of the fermentation process (selection of the microorganisms, the lupin variety, and the fermentation conditions) allows to improve safety of high-quality proteinaceous ingredients."

abstract = "This paper proposes an endpoint video combiner architecture in a multipoint control unit (MCU) system for high definition multiparty video conferencing. The proposed architecture addresses the current reliability, computational and quality drawbacks of a conventional centralized based video combiner architecture. This is achieved by redesigning the MCU video to move away the video combiner from the bridge and into the client endpoints. Moreover, the proposed architecture represents a serverless system and is able to scale a large number of clients at high resolutions in a multipoint video conferencing session. In order to realize this design, this paper also proposes a custom robust sustainable session management protocol which allows a dynamic multi-port management between the MCU video and client endpoints. In addition, the proposed custom session management protocol includes recommendation for a session protection structure. Experimental results suggest that the proposed architecture exhibits significant computational frame rate performance gains of up to 762.95% in comparison with the conventional centralized video combiner architecture based on a series of four and eight high definition combined video assessments. Moreover, reliability analysis suggests that the proposed architecture is also able to consistently sustain a high frame rate performance within a long duration high definition multipoint video conferencing session."

abstract = "In this paper, we consider abelian functor calculus, the calculus of functors of abelian categories established by the second author and McCarthy. We carefully construct a category of abelian categories and suitably homotopically defined functors, and show that this category, equipped with the directional derivative, is a cartesian differential category in the sense of Blute, Cockett, and Seely. This provides an abstract framework that makes certain analogies between classical and functor calculus explicit. Inspired by Huang, Marcantognini, and Young's chain rule for higher order directional derivatives of functions, we define a higher order directional derivative for functors of abelian categories. We show that our higher order directional derivative is related to the iterated partial directional derivatives of the second author and McCarthy by a Faà di Bruno style formula. We obtain a higher order chain rule for our directional derivatives using a feature of the cartesian differential category structure, and with this provide a formulation for the nth layers of the Taylor tower of a composition of functors F∘G in terms of the derivatives and directional derivatives of F and G, reminiscent of similar formulations for functors of spaces or spectra by Arone and Ching. Throughout, we provide explicit chain homotopy equivalences that tighten previously established quasi-isomorphisms for properties of abelian functor calculus."

The coal samples were dried and dissolved using microwave-assisted digestion technique. The validity of the method was tested using standard reference material and certified values were found in the limits of 95% confidence level. Since the concentrations of matrix elements of coal other than carbon are low enough not to cause any spectral interferences, the linear calibration method was applied in all quantifications without any problem. The calibration standards were prepared in sulphuric acid. The method was accurate, fast, simple and sensitive. The limit of detection (LOD, 3δ, N=10) and the limit of quantification (LOQ, 10δ, N=10) were found to be 0.01 and 0.03% (w/w), respectively. The sulphur concentrations of various kinds of the coal samples received around Turkey were determined. The sulphur contents of the coal samples were ranged from ≤LOQ to 1.2%."

Primary melanocortin neurons releasing melanocortin receptor ligands residing in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus are regulated by nutrient-sensing and metabolic signals. A smaller group of primary neurons releasing melanocortin agonists in the nucleus tractus solitarius in the brainstem are also regulated by signals of metabolic state. Two melanocortin receptors regulate energy homeostasis. Melanocortin-4 receptors regulate satiety and autonomic outputs controlling peripheral metabolism. The functions of melanocortin-3 receptors (MC3R) expressed in hypothalamic and limbic structures are less clear. Here we discuss published data and preliminary observations from our laboratory suggesting that neural MC3R regulate inputs into systems governing the synchronization of rhythms in behavior and metabolism with nutrient intake. Mice subjected to a restricted feeding protocol, where a limited number of calories are presented at a 24h interval, rapidly exhibit bouts of increased wakefulness and activity which anticipate food presentation. The full expression of these responses is dependent on MC3R. Moreover, MC3R knockout mice are unique in exhibiting a dissociation of weight loss from improved glucose homeostasis when subject to a restricted feeding protocol. While mice lacking MC3R fed ad libitum exhibit normal to moderate hyperinsulinemia, when subjected to a restricted protocol they develop hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia. Collectively, our data suggest that the central nervous melanocortin system is a point convergence in the control of energy balance and the expression of rhythms anticipating nutrient intake. The paper represents an invited review by a symposium, award winner or keynote speaker at the Society for the Study of Ingestive Behavior [SSIB] Annual Meeting in Pittsburg, July 2010."

In the current study, for the first time, solid phase extraction combined with solvent-based de-emulsification dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (SPE-SD-DLLME) was developed for preconcentration and trace detection of cadmium in water samples using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (FAAS). The adsorbed cadmium ions on prepared SPE (75mL of aqueous solution) were eluted by optimized elution solvent and introduced to the second microextraction step. The effective variables of SPE including the pH of sample, flow rates, type, concentration and volume of the eluent and the effect of potentially interfering ions of the separation of cadmium were evaluated and optimized. Also, several factors that influence the SD-DLLME step such as pH, neocuproine concentration (the cadmium binding ligand), type of dispersed/de-emulsifier solvent, volume of disperser/de-emulsifier solvent and type and volume of extraction solvents were investigated. SPE-SD-DLLME provides a preconcentration factor of 165 for cadmium ions. Calibration plot was linear in the range of 0.1–50μgL−1 with correlation of determination (r2) of 0.988. The precision and limit of detection of proposed method were 5.1% (RSD%, n=8) and 0.03μgL−1, respectively."

The calibration of the SS-GFAAS analysis was possible with the application of the three-point-estimation standard addition method, while the SB methods were mostly calibrated against matrix-matched and/or acidic standards. Spectral and non-spectral interferences were studied in SB-GFAAS after digestion of the samples. The SS-GFAAS method required the use of less sensitive spectral lines of the analytes and a higher internal furnace gas (Ar) flow rate to decrease the sensitivity for crystal samples of higher (doped) analyte content. The chemical forms of the matrix produced at various stages of the graphite furnace heating cycle, dispensed either as a solid sample or a solution (after digestion), were studied by means of the X-ray near-edge absorption structure (XANES). These results revealed that the solid matrix vaporized/deposited in the graphite furnace is mostly present in the metallic form, while the dry residue from the solution form mostly vaporized/deposited as the oxide of niobium."

abstract = "In recent years, there has been an increase in the production of sheep milk in our country, which has been used mainly in cheese-making. This production, however, is not well standardised, as there are neither defined protocols nor well-characterised products for this procedure. Previously, different methodologies for making two types of sheep cheeses were developed at our institute. In the present work, the levels of free amino acids, organic acids, free fatty acids and volatile compounds for these sheep cheeses were studied in order to thoroughly characterise them. Therefore, we have produced two types of cheeses: one using a starter of Streptococcus thermophilus, in which the curd was cut into 5-mm pieces, washed and then heated to 43°C (S cheeses); the other one using a mixed starter composed of S. thermophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, in which the curd was cut into smaller pieces, was not washed and was heated to 47°C (L cheeses). These cheeses were analysed at 2 and 180 days of ripening. Free amino acids (FAAs) and organic acids were studied by HPLC, free fatty acids (FFAs) were quantified by GC and volatile compounds were analysed by SPME-GC-FID/MS. The concentrations of all FAAs were significantly higher in the L cheeses than in the S cheeses, and this was evident from the beginning of the ripening. Both types of cheeses showed similar changes in the concentrations of some FAAs during ripening, but S cheeses were characterised by higher percentages of Phe, Leu and Val, while L cheeses had higher percentages of Pro, Ile, His and Asp. Lactic and citric acid were the most important organic acids present in both types of cheeses. At the end of the ripening, L cheeses presented higher levels of succinic and formic acids, while S cheeses showed a much higher amount of acetic acid. The levels of FFAs increased during ripening, and myristic, palmitic, stearic and oleic acids were the most abundant ones in both types of cheeses. L cheeses showed significantly higher levels of all FFAs at the end of the ripening and presented a greater increase in the percentages of short-chain fatty acids during ripening compared to S cheeses. Regarding volatile compounds, higher levels of aldehydes and ketones characterised the L cheeses, whereas S cheeses had higher proportions of esters and alcohols. Both types of cheeses presented similar areas in the most compounds of acids group, but the levels of butanoic and hexanoic acids were significantly higher in S cheeses than in L cheeses. The results of the present work offer an important contribution to this field: they have provided a better understanding of the changes that occur during the ripening of the two sheep cheeses manufactured with technologies developed in our group. These technologies could also be used by small sheep farm producers located in our region with the aim of increasing the economic yield of their products."

A correct approach to sampling procedure is always a critical issue in scientific investigation. In particular, in food geographical traceability studies, where the cause–effect relations between the soil of origin and the final foodstuff is sought, a representative sampling of the territory under investigation is certainly an imperative. This research concerns a pilot study to investigate the field homogeneity with respect to both field extension and sampling depth, taking also into account the seasonal variability. Four Lambrusco production sites of the Modena district were considered. The X-Ray diffraction spectra, collected on the powder of each soil sample, were treated as fingerprint profiles to be deciphered by multivariate and multi-way data analysis, namely PCA and PARAFAC. The differentiation pattern observed in soil samples, as obtained by this fast and non-destructive analytical approach, well matches with the results obtained by characterization with other costly analytical techniques, such as ICP/MS, GFAAS, FAAS, etc. Thus, the proposed approach furnishes a rational basis to reduce the number of soil samples to be collected for further analytical characterization, i.e. metals content, isotopic ratio of radiogenic element, etc., while maintaining an exhaustive description of the investigated production areas."

abstract = "It is well known that toxic blooms of Prymnesium parvum result in widespread fish mortalities. An assemblage of fatty acid amides (FAAs) has been shown to be toxic metabolites of P. parvum. Several compounds and compound classes have been implicated in P. parvum toxicity, but unlike FAAs, thus far none have been shown to accumulate to lethal levels at ichthyotoxic bloom events. The purpose of this study is to characterize the hemolytic activity, cytotoxicity, and ichthyotoxicity of the fatty acid amides identified from P. parvum using mammalian red blood cells, mouse neuroblastoma cells, and rainbow trout gill cells. We also investigate the effect of abiotic factors (divalent cations and pH) on fatty acid amide toxicity. Samples from P. parvum bloom events with fish kills were analyzed in order to demonstrate that fatty acid amides are found in lethal levels at fish kills. Hemolytic and cytoxicity assays were completed with the introduction of abiotic factors to assess fatty acid amides toxicity. Our results show that fatty acid amides are detected in toxicologically significant quantities in samples from at least one fish kill event. We also show that the toxicity of oleamide and linoleamide in cell culture is increased in the presence of divalent cations and increasing pH, demonstrating that multiple abiotic factors affect the toxicity of fatty acid amides. Fatty acid amides possess the hemolytic and cytotoxic properties previously attributed to P. parvum toxins throughout history. After fatty acid amides have been released into the environment, multiple abiotic factors can increase their toxicity."

The proportions of liquid-phase of the slurries composed by HCl, HNO3 and Triton X-100 solutions have been optimized applying a constrained mixture design. The optimized conditions were 200mg of sample ground in a tungsten carbide balls mill (particle size<100μm), dilution in a liquid-phase composed by 2.0molL−1 nitric, 2.0molL−1 hydrochloric acid and 2.5% Triton X-100 solutions (in the proportions of 50%, 12% and 38% respectively), sonication time of 10min and final slurry volume of 50.0mL. This method allowed the determination of manganese and zinc by FAAS, with detection limits of 0.46 and 0.66μgg−1, respectively. The precisions, expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD), are 6.9 and 5.5% (n=10), for concentrations of manganese and zinc of 20 and 40μgg−1, respectively. The accuracy of the method was confirmed by analysis of the certified apple leaves (NIST 1515) and spinach leaves (NIST 1570a). The proposed method was applied for the determination of manganese and zinc in tea leaves used for the preparation of infusions. The obtained concentrations varied between 42 and 118μgg−1 and 18.6 and 90μgg−1, respectively, for manganese and zinc. The results were compared with those obtained by an acid digestion procedure and determination of the elements by FAAS. There was no significant difference between the results obtained by the two methods based on a paired t-test (at 95% confidence level)."

Data are reported here on the quantities of 20 free amino acids (FAAs) and three purine alkaloids (measured by UHPLC), total polyphenols (measured by Folin-Ciocalteu assay), and antioxidant activity (DPPH). The total amounts of FAAs in non-Camellia tea (0.62–18.99mg/g) are generally less than that of Camellia tea (16.55–24.99mg/g). However, for certain FAAs, the quantities were much higher in some non-Camellia teas, such as γ-aminobutyric acid in teas from Ampelopsis grossedentata, Isodon serra and Hibiscus sabdariffa. Interestingly, theanine was detected in tea from Potentilla fruticosa (1.16±0.81mg/g). Furthermore, the content of polyphenols in teas from A. grossedentata, Acer tataricum subsp. ginnala are significantly higher than those from Camellia tea; teas from I. serra, Pistacia chinensis and A. tataricum subsp. ginnala have remarkable antioxidant activities similar to the activities from green tea (44.23μg/mL). Purine alkaloids (caffeine, theobromine and theophylline) were not detected in non-Camellia teas. The investigation suggest some non-Camellia teas may be great functional natural products with potential for prevention of chronic diseases and aging, by providing with abundant polyphenols, antioxidants and specific FAAs."

The extraction efficiency by modified cloud point extraction (m-CPE) was compared with conventional cloud point extraction (c-CPE) method. The procedure for both CPE methods was comprised of formation of metal complexes with a hydrophobic chelating agent, dithizone, followed by entrapment of the chelates in a nonionic surfactant, Triton X-114. For c-CPE, the surfactant rich phase was treated with ethanolic solution of nitric acid and analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectrometer (FAAS). Whereas for m-CPE, aqueous nitric acid was used to back extract the metal ions from the surfactant rich phase and finally determined. The efficiency of the methods was tested by analyzing certified reference material and standard addition to a real sample. All the experimental parameters were optimized. At optimized experimental conditions, preconcentration and enhancement factors were 62.5 and 78.0 to 83.0 respectively for m-CPE, 25.0 and 56.0% higher than that of c-CPE. This improvement might be due to elimination of the effects of surfactant on the signal of analytes by FAAS. The developed method of m-CPE was applied successfully for analysis of the selected heavy metals in water and muscle tissues samples of fish of different lakes in Sindh, Pakistan."

A solvent known as tunable polarity solvent (TPS), mixture of 1,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]-undec-7-ene (DBU) and 1-decanol, has been employed as extractant in aqueous medium. In first step this mixture can be made polar by slowly bubbling the antisolvent trigger (CO2) through the solution, which makes a monophasic solution. During this step hydrophobic complexes of the metals with 8-hydroxy quinoline (8-HQ) were extracted by TPS. Then the mixture was switched back to hydrophobic one by heating and/or bubbling nitrogen, turning the mixture into two phases again. In second phase the metals were leached out from the complexes entrapped in TPS, by treating with a solution of nitric acid and exposing the mixture to CO2, which switched the mixture into single phase. Then N2 purging and/or heating again turned the mixture into two phases. The acidic aqueous phase containing the metals was introduced to FAAS for analysis, whereas TPS was recycled for next experiment. Different parameters, affecting the efficiency the technique, were optimized by multivariate approach. The method was applied to certified reference material of water and to a real sample spiked with standards of known concentration, to confirm its validity and accuracy. LOD obtained for Pb and Cd were 0.560 and 0.056μgL−1 respectively. The developed method was applied successfully to the real water samples of two lakes of Sindh, Pakistan."

Compared to the few professional astronauts, cosmonauts, and taikonauts who have flown in space through government programs in the past six decades, the number of these new spaceflight participants (SFPs) will rapidly expand. The SFP cohort will have a much greater age range than traditional astronauts and may also have a much greater prevalence of medical problems. To date, regulation regarding medical screening, certification, or guidelines for suborbital and orbital SFPs has been relegated to the commercial space companies. However, many organizations, ranging from space advocacy groups to academic institutions to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), have offered input and recommendations for medical screening of SFPs for the industry’s consideration. Simultaneously, governmental space agencies have made progress in defining appropriate preflight medical testing and medical standards and for those commercial providers that plan to provide access to the International Space Station (ISS). There is limited information available with regard to the effect of spaceflight-related stressors like acceleration, microgravity, and altered atmospheric pressure and breathing gas mixtures on individuals with medical conditions. To date, most research on humans exposed to challenging or extreme environments has focused on a healthy, young, and predominately male population. However, recent studies funded in part by the FAA and conducted by university programs have examined the effect of certain medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and back problems in the acceleration environment. While the numbers are small, the early data from these studies examining the effects of acceleration are reassuring. There is still much for space medicine providers to learn from this new cohort of individuals that will soon be participating in commercial space activities. With appropriate training and treatment or stabilization of medical liabilities, most of those who desire to fly in space will be able to safely accomplish their dream."

While the FEO entrains to fasting/feeding related cues and drives FAA independently of the pacemaker in the SCN, it must disengage the suppressing signals of the SCN for the behavioural and physiological manifestations of meal anticipation to occur outside of the typical period of arousal. This review provides a brief overview of mammalian circadian biology before summarizing experimental data demonstrating several mechanisms by which this may occur, including: reducing activation of SCN cells receiving retinal input, transient disorganization of SCN outputs, and reduced sensitivity to SCN signals in hypothalamic sites responsible for integrating homeostatic and circadian information. Further investigation of these mechanisms will be key to elucidating pharmacological or behavioural interventions that suppress the negative psychological and health effects of light-driven circadian rhythms in humans, specifically those with work schedules that do not conform to the solar day."

Here it was investigated with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss W.) juveniles 1) if the molecular form of the ingested nitrogen (free (F) AA, peptides or proteins) may also affect the dietary protein quality; 2) if this possible influence may be affected by juvenile size and adaptation to the diet; and 3) what is the optimum synthetic FAA to protein ratio. Two experiments were carried out at 15°C (3 tanks/treatment) in which 1050 small juveniles (0.70g) and 450 large juveniles (2.85g) were randomly assigned to fifteen 15l-tanks (70 fish/tank) and to fifteen 45l-tanks (30 fish/tank), respectively. In both experiments, fish were fed twice a day to satiation for 9, 17 and 25 feeding days (3periods) five isoenergetic and isonitrogenous (412g crude protein/kg dry matter (DM)) diets containing graded levels of coated FAA, replacing 0, 25, 50, 75 or 100% (D0–D100) of the cod muscle meal, an intact protein. Compared to D0, growth rate (DGC, % per day) and feed intake (g DM/kg0.75 per day) were significantly reduced only for small juveniles and large juveniles fed diets containing at least 50 and 75% of FAA, respectively. Protein deposition (g/kg0.75 per day) was not significantly reduced for juveniles fed diets D25–D50, but well for juveniles fed diets D75–D100. The decrease of growth rate and protein deposition at FAA inclusion rate below 75% was largely explained by a reduction of voluntary feed intake while nitrogen retention efficiency was significantly reduced only for diet D100. The maximum FAA level that still ensured reasonable growth (85% of maximum) was 65%, at both juvenile sizes, after an adaptation period of 17days. Larger juveniles tolerated higher FAA dietary levels than smaller juveniles, indicating ontogeny-related changes in FAA utilization efficiencies. Finally fish accustomed to FAA-rich diets were able to tolerate higher FAA dietary levels but the maximum FAA inclusion level was modulated by fish size. In conclusion, here we show that the dietary protein quality is dependent of the molecular form of the ingested nitrogen in rainbow trout juveniles and that this quality is modulated by the ratio of synthetic FAA to protein (or FAA inclusion rate), the adaptation of the fish to the diet and the fish size."

Femoral arterial access (FAA) during diagnostic coronary angiography (CAG) and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) are associated with several vascular complications (VC). VC rate in our experience a decade ago was 3.02% and higher in women (4.7% in women, and 1.67% in men, p < 0.0006), with an OR of 2.81 (95% CI: 1.51–5.22).
Methods
Patients who underwent CAG and PCI utilizing FAA (n = 2617) were separated into Period 1 (2005 to 2008; 1970 patients; Male 1045; Female 925) and Period 2 (2016–2017; 647 patients; Male 357; Female 290). FA access was preceded by anatomic FA localization during Period 1 vs. additional fluoroscopic marking of femoral head during Period 2. Ultrasound guidance was not utilized during either period. VCs were defined as hematoma>3 cm, major bleeding requiring blood transfusion or hemoglobin drop >2 g, retroperitoneal bleed, pseudoaneurysm, AV fistula, arterial thrombosis, distal embolism, dissection, and transient limb ischemia.
Results
Rate of VCs did not differ from Periods 1 to 2 (2.44% vs. 2.32%, p = 1.0). An elevated rate of VCs experienced by women in Period 1 (Female 3.68% vs. Male 1.34%, p < 0.05) is no longer noted in Period 2(Female 2.07% vs. Male 2.52%, p = 0.79). Vascular closure device (VCD) use was protective in both Periods 1 and 2.
Conclusions
The use of fluoroscopic marking of femoral head prior to access, smaller sheath size, and being a high femoral volume center may have contributed to the reduced incidence of VCs in women. VCD utilization is continuing to reduce VC rates in both men and women."

The target list included 13 emerging contaminants (EC): thiabendazole, acesulfame, fenofibric acid, valsartan, irbesartan, salicylic acid, diclofenac, carbamazepine, 4-aminoantipyrine (4-AA), 4-acetyl aminoantipyrine (4-AAA), 4-formyl aminoantipyrine (4-FAA), venlafaxine and benzoylecgonine. The aqueous and solid phases of the sewage sludge were analyzed making use of Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE) and UltraSonic Extraction (USE) for sample treatment, respectively. The methods were validated at three concentration levels: 0.2, 2 and 20μgL−1 for the aqueous phase, and 50, 500 and 2000μgkg−1 for the solid phase of the sludge. In general, the method was satisfactorily validated, showing good recoveries (70–120%) and precision (RSD<20%). Regarding the limit of quantification (LOQ), it was below 0.1μgL−1 in the aqueous phase and below 50μgkg−1 in the solid phase for the majority of the analytes. The method applicability was tested by analysis of samples from a wider study on degradation of emerging pollutants in sewage sludge under anaerobic digestion. The key benefits of these methodologies are: • SPE and USE are appropriate sample procedures to extract selected emerging contaminants from the aqueous phase of the sewage sludge and the solid residue. • LC–MS/MS is highly suitable for determining emerging contaminants in both sludge phases. • Up to our knowledge, the main metabolites of dipyrone had not been studied before in sewage sludge."

In particular, the quality characteristics determined proximal and gas compositions, melanosis scores, pH, total volatile basic-nitrogen (TVB-N), thiobarbituric acid (TBA) as well as free amino acid (FAA). In addition, the emergent data were compared to those subject to vacuum packaging as well as conventional preservative method of sulphite treatment (SUL). Most determined qualities exhibited quantitative differences with storage. By comparisons, while pH and TVB-N statistically varied between treatments (P<0.05) and TBA that ranged between ∼0.15 and 0.30mgMDA/kg appeared least at end of storage for 100% N2 treated-group, the latter having decreased melanosis scores showed such treatments with high promise to keep the colour of GRS sample hence, potential replacement for SUL group.

abstract = "In the present work, a novel and efficient method, namely in-tube electro-membrane extraction followed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (IEME-FAAS), is used for the selective determination of chromium(VI) ions in some environmental samples. In this approach, which is based upon the electro-kinetic migration of ionized compounds, by applying an electrical potential difference, the analyte is extracted from an aqueous sample solution through a supported liquid membrane (SLM) into an acceptor solution. A thin polypropylene (PP) sheet placed inside a tube acts as a support for the membrane solvent used, and 100μL of an aqueous acceptor solution is separated by this solvent from 5.0mL of an aqueous donor solution. In order to achieve the best extraction efficiency, the effective parameters involved including the voltage magnitude, SLM solvent, extraction time, and pH range are optimized. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the IEME-FAAS method provides a good linearity in the range of 10.0–600ngmL−1, a low limit of detection (3.0ngmL−1), and good extraction repeatabilities (RSDs below 8.6%, n=5). Finally, the developed method is used for the selective determination of chromium(VI) ions in the tap, river, and mineral water samples."

abstract = "Accidents in twin-engine aircraft carry a higher risk of fatality compared with single engine aircraft and constitute 9% of all general aviation accidents. The different flight profile (higher airspeed, service ceiling, increased fuel load, and aircraft yaw in engine failure) may make comparable studies on single-engine aircraft accident causes less relevant. The objective of this study was to identify the accident causes for non-commercial operations in twin engine aircraft. A NTSB accident database query for accidents in twin piston engine airplanes of 4–8 seat capacity with a maximum certified weight of 3000–8000lbs. operating under 14CFR Part 91 for the period spanning 2002 and 2012 returned 376 accidents. Accident causes and contributing factors were as per the NTSB final report categories. Total annual flight hour data for the twin engine piston aircraft fleet were obtained from the FAA. Statistical analyses employed Chi Square, Fisher’s Exact and logistic regression analysis. Neither the combined fatal/non-fatal accident nor the fatal accident rate declined over the period spanning 2002–2012. Under visual weather conditions, the largest number, n=27, (27%) of fatal accidents was attributed to malfunction with a failure to follow single engine procedures representing the most common contributing factor. In degraded visibility, poor instrument approach procedures resulted in the greatest proportion of fatal crashes. Encountering thunderstorms was the most lethal of all accident causes with all occupants sustaining fatal injuries. At night, a failure to maintain obstacle/terrain clearance was the most common accident cause leading to 36% of fatal crashes. The results of logistic regression showed that operations at night (OR 3.7), off airport landings (OR 14.8) and post-impact fire (OR 7.2) all carried an excess risk of a fatal flight. This study indicates training areas that should receive increased emphasis for twin-engine training/recency. First, increased training should be provided on single engine procedures in the event of an engine failure. Second, more focus should be placed on instrument approaches and recovery from unusual aircraft attitude where visibility is degraded. Third, pilots should be made aware of appropriate speed selection for inadvertent flights in convective weather. Finally, emphasizing the importance of conducting night operations under instrument flight rules with its altitude restrictions should lead to a diminished proportion of accidents attributed to failure to maintain obstacle/terrain clearance."

Entrainment to food is mediated by a food entrainable circadian oscillator (FEO) that is formally and mechanistically separable from the hypothalamic light-entrainable oscillator. This experiment examined whether seasonal changes in day length affect the function of the FEO in male Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus). Hamsters housed in long (LD; 15h light/day) or short (SD; 9h light/day) photoperiods were subjected to a timed-feeding schedule for 10days, during which food was available only during a 5h interval of the light phase. Running wheel activity occurring within a 3h window immediately prior to actual or anticipated food delivery was operationally-defined as food anticipatory activity (FAA). After the timed-feeding interval, hamsters were fed ad libitum, and FAA was assessed 2 and 7days later via probe trials of total food deprivation. During timed-feeding, all hamsters exhibited increases FAA, but FAA emerged more rapidly in SD; in probe trials, FAA was greater in magnitude and persistence in SD. Gonadectomy in LD did not induce the SD-like FAA phenotype, indicating that withdrawal of gonadal hormones is not sufficient to mediate the effects of photoperiod on FAA. Entrainment of the circadian system to light markedly affects the functional output of the FEO via gonadal hormone-independent mechanisms. Rapid emergence and persistent expression of FAA in SD may reflect a seasonal adaptation that directs behavior toward sources of nutrition with high temporal precision at times of year when food is scarce."

The correct association between metal ions and proteins is essential because this binding can significantly interfere with normal protein function. Employment of a metalloproteomic study of liver samples from diabetic rats permitted determination of the differential abundance of copper-, selenium-, zinc- and magnesium-associated proteins between diabetic, diabetic treatment with insulin and non-diabetic rats. Proteins were detected by ESI–MS/MS. Seventy-five different proteins were found with alterations in the metal ions of interest. The most prominent pathways affected under the diabetic model included: amino-acid metabolism and its derivates, glycogen storage, metabolism of carbohydrates, redox systems and glucose metabolism. Overall, the current methods employed yielded a greater understanding of metal binding and how type 1 diabetes and insulin treatment can modify some metal bonds in proteins, and therefore affect their mechanism of action and function."

Ostracode valves are increasingly useful targets for amino acid geochronologic investigations yet little is known about the influence of taxonomy or environmental variables on ostracode protein diagenesis. This paper documents the effects of taxonomy and elevated environmental pH on the amino acid composition of ostracode valves. In one experiment, modern ostracode valves from the genus Candona (Cypridoidea) and Limnocythere (Cytheroidea) were submerged in pH 7 and pH 10 buffers and heated at 120 °C for up to 32 d. The buffer solutions and a subset of the ostracode valves were analyzed for their total hydrolysable amino acid (THAA) d/l values and concentrations. The remaining valves were analyzed for their free amino acid (FAA) d/l values and concentrations. In a second experiment, modern valves from four species of ostracodes within the Cypridoidea were heated at 110 °C for up to 160 d. THAA aspartic acid (Asp) and glutamic acid (Glu) d/l values were monitored. Finally, the amino acid compositions in a suite of fossil Candona valves from outcrops in the western United States, including the problematic Ana River section, are compared across a broader spectrum of amino acid data. A total of 586 samples were analyzed. The results show that both THAA and FAA d/l values and concentrations were higher in ostracode valves heated in pH 10 buffer than in valves heated in pH 7 buffer. THAA d/l values in the buffers were consistently higher than in the associated ostracode valves. Amino acids were readily leached from modern Limnocythere valves but minimal leaching was observed from young fossil Candona valves. The extent of leaching was not pH dependent. The rates and extent of racemization for Asp and Glu were similar in Candona spp. and Limnocythere valves heated in either pH 7 or 10 buffers. The rates and extent of amino acid racemization for alanine, valine, and epimerization of isoleucine were consistently lower in Limnocythere valves, regardless of pH environment. Asp racemized significantly faster in Heterocypris valves than in Candona or Ilyocypris valves. There were no substantial differences in the rate of Glu racemization in Heterocypris, Candona, or Ilyocypris valves, nor in the rate of racemization of Asp or Glu in valves from three species of Candona. The heating experiments demonstrate that environmental pH can have significant impact on the amino acid composition of ostracode valves. Differences in the rates of amino acid racemization were detected at both the family and superfamily level. The Ana River Candona valves are strongly enriched in Asp, Glu, and glycine when compared with other fossil Candona valves. These results are not explained by taxonomic differences or by diagenesis under basic (alkaline) environmental conditions. Instead, they suggest that other environmental variables during valve calcification may be responsible for the unique amino acid signature of the Ana River material."

Differing levels of feed-grade crystalline amino acids (FAA) were evaluated for effects on microbial efficiency (MOEFF) and nitrogen metabolism in the rumen environment. Six treatments were evaluated (n = 24, n = 4) using a continuous-culture system with a fractional dilution rate of 0.06. A basal diet of ground corn (57%), soybean meal (35%), and soybean hulls (8%) was fed (50 g/d) with additional amounts of an equal mix ofl-Lys,l-Arg, and dl-Met at 0, 3, 6, 12, or 18% (FAA). A 6% blood meal diet was fed as a positive control. After 4 d of acclimation, NH3and pH of fermenters were analyzed 1 h before and 4 h after feeding for 3 d. Nitrogen, OM, and purines were analyzed in diets, bacteria, and effluent to calculate MOEFF. Ammonia concentration increased as FAA supplementation in the diets increased (P < 0.01). Microbial efficiency tended to be greater for 6 and 12% FAA and blood meal diets (P = 0.10) and least for 3 and 18% FAA. An increase was measured in total bacterial amino acid (AA) composition, but the ratio of AA in bacteria remained similar with the exception of Arg, Asp, and Orn (P < 0.03). Escape of AA from fermenters was greatest (P < 0.01) in 0% FAA and blood meal diets, leading to the conclusion that FAA supplementation does not supply a viable source of RUP to the animal. Rumen undegradable nitrogen was greatest in 0 and 3% FAA; this along with increased NH3levels lead to the conclusion that supplemental FAA provided excess nitrogen, which did not result in a direct improvement of MOEFF. Our data agreed with previously published data concluding AA degradation rate was more rapid than AA outflow at feasible feeding levels."

For example, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Destination 2025 (FAA 2025) has a goal to develop cleaner jet fuels, explore new ways to meet environmental and energy goals, and foster development towards one billion gallons of renewable jet fuel for aviation use by 2018. Alternative jet fuels via Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) and hydrotreated vegetable oils (HEFA) have already been approved for use in jet fuel blends of up to 50%. Other conversion processes, such as alcohol to jet (ATJ), are in various stages of development. This chapter focuses on opportunities for production of jet fuel blend components through an ethanol intermediate via a number of processing routes. These are then compared to conversion routes through other oxygenated intermediates, such as higher alcohols (eg, butanol). Higher alcohols provide technically simple conversion chemistry routes to jet blend components, but are currently produced in small quantities (relative to fuels) for the chemical market. Ethanol on the other hand is widely produced as both a fuel and a chemical and has an established distribution infrastructure. Furthermore, renewable ethanol volumetric yields via fermentation surpass those of higher alcohols. Ethanol conversion processes can produce both paraffinic and cyclic molecules. However, the conversion pathway from ethanol through ethylene is more challenging than from higher alcohol-derived olefins. Mixed oxygenated intermediates can also belong in the ATJ category, but are not yet at the same stage of development as alcohols. The major market drivers for producing alternative jet fuel components, including ATJ, are climate change, cost stability, and national security. Biologically derived ATJ fuels can provide significant climate change benefits by reducing CO2 life cycle emissions, possibly exceeding 80%. In addition, they produce lower levels of sulphur oxides and particulate matter. Because jet fuel accounts for 40% of an airline’s operating costs, reducing price fluctuations associated with petroleum is another significant driver. Finally, dependence on foreign oil could be minimized using alternative fuels. As a result of these drivers, government agencies as well as the private sector have set aggressive targets to increase their consumption of alternative fuels. In addition to targets, the government has provided favourable policies to incentivize alternative aviation fuel use. Carbon taxes abroad and potentially in the United States will drive up prices of petroleum-based fuels, making alternative fuels more competitive. Government incentives in the form of renewable fuel credits are expected to further improve alternative fuel viability. Energy Information Agency (EIA) projections suggest there may be a significant surplus of ethanol over that required for gasoline blending, potentially filling 4% of jet fuel demand in 2020. EIA projections also suggest there is a positive price differential between ethanol intermediate and jet fuel in future scenario projections, unless oil prices drop to the Low Oil Case. Ethanol currently has a price and market share advantage over other alcohols, such as butanol. However, development of ethanol to jet technology lags butanol to jet technology. Reported production costs for raw ethanol, projected ethanol supplies over that needed for gasoline blending, and the presence of existing infrastructure all suggest that ethanol is a viable intermediate for the production of alternative jet fuel components."

The present speciation procedure for Cr(III) and Cr(VI) is based on combination of carrier element-free coprecipitation (CEFC) and flame atomic absorption spectrometric (FAAS) determinations. In this method a newly synthesized organic coprecipitant, 5-chloro-3-[4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylimino]indolin-2-one (CFMEPI), was used without adding any carrier element for coprecipitation of chromium(III). After reduction of chromium(VI) by concentrated H2SO4 and ethanol, the procedure was applied for the determination of total chromium. Chromium(VI) was calculated as the difference between the amount of total chromium and chromium(III). The optimum conditions for coprecipitation and speciation processes were investigated on several commonly tested experimental parameters, such as pH of the solution, amount of coprecipitant, sample volume, etc. No considerable interference was observed from the other investigated anions and cations, which may be found in natural water samples. The preconcentration factor was found to be 40. The detection limit for chromium(III) corresponding to three times the standard deviation of the blank (N=10) was found 0.7μgL−1. The present procedure was successfully applied for speciation of chromium in several liquid and solid environmental samples. In order to support the accuracy of the method, the certified reference materials (CRM-TMDW-500 Drinking Water and CRM-SA-C Sandy Soil C) were analyzed, and standard APDC-MIBK liquid-liquid extraction method was performed. The results obtained were in good agreement with the certified values."

To determine whether lead-containing shields have lead dust on the external surface.
Methods
Institutional review board approval was obtained for this descriptive study of a convenience sample of 172 shields. Each shield was tested for external lead dust via a qualitative rapid on-site test and a laboratory-based quantitative dust wipe analysis, flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The χ2 test was used to test the association with age, type of shield, lead sheet thickness, storage method, and visual and radiographic appearance.
Results
Sixty-three percent (95% confidence interval [CI]: 56%-70%) of the shields had detectable surface lead by FAAS and 50% (95% CI: 43%-57%) by the qualitative method. Lead dust by FAAS ranged from undetectable to 998 μg/ft2. The quantitative detection of lead was significantly associated with the following: (1) visual appearance of the shield (1 = best, 3 = worst): 88% of shields that scored 3 had detectable dust lead; (2) type of shield: a greater proportion of the pediatric patient, full-body, and thyroid shields were positive than vests and skirts; (3) use of a hanger for storage: 27% of shields on a hanger were positive versus 67% not on hangers. Radiographic determination of shield intactness, thickness of interior lead sheets, and age of shield were unrelated to presence of surface dust lead.
Conclusions
Sixty-three percent of shields had detectable surface lead that was associated with visual appearance, type of shield, and storage method. Lead-containing shields are a newly identified, potentially widespread source of lead exposure in the health industry."

During the period examined, PM1 daily concentrations ranged between 0.3µgm−3 and 55µgm−3 with a mean value of 8 µg m–3, a standard deviation of 7µgm−3 and a median value of 6µgm−3. As far as PM1 chemical composition is concerned, the mean values of the trace element concentrations decreased in the following order: Ca>Fe>Al>Na>K>Cr>Mg>Pb>Ni≈Ti≈Zn>Cd≈Cu>Mn. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allowed the identification of three probable PM1 sources: industrial emissions, traffic and re-suspension of soil dust. Moreover, the results of a procedure applied to study the potential long-range transport contribution to PM1 chemical composition, showed that trace element concentrations do not seem to be affected by air mass origin and path. This was probably due to the strong impact of the local emission sources and the lack of the concentration measurements of some important elements and compounds that could better reveal the long-range transport influence on PM1 measurements at ground level."

The method is based on the extraction induced by emulsion breaking, in which the elements of interest are transferred to an aqueous phase before the measurement by FAAS. In the method, each sample of used lubricating oil was diluted with toluene (20% v/v) and the resulting solution was emulsified with a Triton X-114 solution containing HNO3. Further, the water-in-oil emulsion was broken by centrifugation for 30min at 3500rpm, originating a system with two well-separated phases: (i) the upper phase, containing the used lubricating oil diluted in toluene and (ii) the lower aqueous phase, containing the analytes that were extracted from oil. The lower phase was collected, diluted with water and the analytes were determined by FAAS. The optimization of the methodology was performed by studying the influence of different parameters that could affect the extraction efficiency such as the nature and concentration of the solvent used for sample dilution, the concentrations of HNO3 and Triton X-114 in the solution employed for emulsification and the operational conditions for extraction (extraction, centrifugation and sampling times). The limits of quantification for Cu, Fe and Mn were 2.9, 77 and 8.2ngg−1, respectively. The accuracy of the method was evaluated by comparison with the reference method based on the total digestion of the samples in a closed-vessel microwave oven. There were no statistical differences between the results obtained with the proposed method and the reference one, except for Fe in the cases where its concentration was higher than 80µgg−1."

A 26% CR regime induced at 14 months of age for 70 days in male C57Bl/6 (ICRFa) mice resulted in a reduction in body mass of 17%. A decrease in daily energy expenditure was associated with decreased body mass in CR mice. There was no difference in total levels of physical activity between the CR and ad libitum (AL) groups; however, activity patterns were different. We developed a Bayesian model to dissect the impact of food anticipation activity (FAA) and feeding on physical activity. FAA was stronger in CR mice and remaining basal activity was higher in AL mice, but CR mice displayed larger diurnal variations as well as a phase shift in their diurnal activity. CR mice displayed lower body temperature, especially late during the dark phase. This was due to lower basal (activity-independent) temperature at all times of the day, coupled to a phase shift in the diurnal rhythm. The correlation between body temperature and physical activity was independent of feeding regimen and light/dark cycles. Reduction of body mass and basal temperature were major compensatory mechanisms to reduced food availability during late-onset, short-term CR."

Psychomotor disturbances are a main clinical feature of major depressive disorder (MDD) but little is known about their EEG signature. One of the most replicated EEG findings in MDD is resting frontal asymmetry in the alpha band (FAA), which is thought to be a correlate of withdrawal behavior and reduced approach motivation. The purpose of this study was to assess psychomotor alterations, alpha band power, FAA and investigate the association between them.
Methods
20 MDD patients and 19 healthy subjects were enrolled. Alpha power and FAA scores were calculated from a resting state EEG. Wrist actigraphy was recorded from the non-dominant arm for 24 h and activity level scores (AL) were extrapolated from the wakeful periods.
Results
MDD patients had a left-lateralized frontal alpha activity and lower AL scores when compared to healthy subjects. A significant correlation was found between mean FAA and AL scores. A negative covariance between power in the lower alpha range and AL scores over the motor cortex bilaterally was detected.
Limitations
Relatively small sample size. Patients were pharmacologically treated with antidepressants.
Conclusions
This study replicates the finding of left-lateralized FAA and lower AL scores in MDD patients, and establishes the first evidence of significant correlations between alpha power, FAA scores and measures of motor activity, which may be interpreted as an expression of impaired motivational drive in MDD."

This study found that an NH4+–N concentration of 1mgL−1 in the water column apparently caused physiological stress on the macrophyte Potamogeton crispus L. The plants accumulated free amino acids (FAA) and lost soluble carbohydrates (SC) under NH4+ stress. These stressful effects of NH4+ were exacerbated under low light availability. Shading significantly increased NH4+ and FAA contents and dramatically decreased SC and starch contents in the plant shoots. At an NH4+–N concentration of 1mgL−1 in the water column, neither growth inhibition nor NH4+ accumulation was observed in the plant tissues of P. crispus under normal light availability. The results showed that 1mgL−1 NH4+–N in the water column was not toxic to P. crispus in a short term. To avoid NH4+ toxicity, active NH4+ transportation out of the cell may cost energy and thus result in a decline of carbohydrate. When NH4+ inescapably accumulates in the plant cell, i.e. under NH4+ stress and shading, NH4+ is scavenged by FAA synthesis."

Ammonium O,O-diethyl dithiophosphate (DDTP) was used to complex cadmium (II) in an acid medium to obtain a neutral hydrophobic complex (ML2). The organic solvent introduced to the sample extracts this complex from the aqueous solution and carries it over the poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) membrane, that had their walls previously filled with the same organic solvent. The organic solvent is solubilized inside the PDMS membrane, leading to a homogeneous phase. The complex strips the lumen of the membrane where, at higher pH, the complex Cd–DDTP is broken down and cadmium (II) is released into the stripping phase. EDTA was used to complex the cadmium (II), helping to trap the analyte in the stripping phase. A multivariate procedure was used to optimize the studied variables. The optimized variables were: sample (donor phase) pH 3.25, DDTP concentration 0.05% (m/v), stripping (acceptor phase) pH 8.75, EDTA concentration 1.5×10−2molL−1, extraction temperature 40°C, extraction time 40min, a solvent mixture N-butyl acetate and hexane (60/40%, v/v) with a volume of 100μL, and addition of ammonium sulfate to saturate the sample.

Few published studies on civilian helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) hoist programs exist. This study provides a demographic analysis of hoist rescue operations performed by the only FAA Part 135 hoist-approved civilian HEMS operator in the United States.
Methods
All persons hoisted between May 29, 2001, and May 28, 2011, were retrospectively analyzed.
Results
Over a 10-year period, 212 of 214 victims were hoisted. The most common indications were fall injuries (38%) and being stranded (21%). Victim demographics showed an average age of 35 ± 17years, predominantly male (79%), often associated with trauma (66%), with a majority (68%) of all victims requiring subsequent transport to a hospital by ground ambulance (24%) or flown by Life Flight (44%). Hoists occurred most often in the afternoon (14:07 ± 3:47 hours), during the weekend (53%), in the months of May-September (71%), at an altitude of 7,488 ± 1487 feet, with the seat harness (39%) being the most common mode of victim extraction. Hoist insertion of search and rescue (SAR) personnel occurred infrequently (5%).

The AIM approach outperforms the aggregate forecasting approach in terms of its out-of-sample air travel demand predictions for different forecast horizons. Variants of AIM, where we restrict the coefficient estimates of some explanatory variables to be the same across individual airports, generally dominate both the aggregate and AIM approaches. The superior out-of-sample performances of these so-called quasi-AIM approaches depend on the trade-off between heterogeneity and estimation uncertainty. We argue that the quasi-AIM approaches exploit the heterogeneity across individual airports efficiently, without suffering from as much estimation uncertainty as the AIM approach."

abstract = "In this study, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was combined with chemometric strategies (PCA, Principal Component Analysis) and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDS) to investigate the metal composition of a printed circuit board (PCB) sample from a mobile phone. Scanning electron microscopy–EDS was used for two main reasons: it was possible at the same time to visualize the sample surface, craters (made by the laser pulses) and also the chemical composition of the samples. A 30mm×40mm area of the mobile phone PCB sample, which was manufactured in 2011, was investigated. In this case, a matrix with 30 rows and 40 columns (1200 points) was analyzed, and 10 pulses were performed at each point. A total of 12,000 emission spectra were recorded in the wavelength range from 186 to 1040nm. After an initial exploratory investigation using PCA, 18 emission lines were selected (representing the elements Al, Au, Ba, Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Sb, Si, Sn, Ti and Zn) and then normalized by the relative intensities, and a new PCA was calculated with the autoscaled data. For example, Au and Si were mainly observed in the superficial electrical contacts and in the bulk of the PCB, respectively. A second sample (a mouse PCB) was also analyzed and Pb (emission lines 357.273, 363.956, 368.346, 373.994 and 405.780nm) was identified in the solders. In addition, this element was determined using FAAS (flame atomic absorption spectrometry) and the Pb concentration was around 25% (w/w). This study opens the possibility for improved recycling processes and the chemical investigation of solid samples measuring a few millimeters in dimension without sample preparation."

abstract = "Virtual Network Functions as a Service (VNFaaS) is a promising business whose technical directions consist of providing network functions as a Service instead of delivering standalone network appliances, leveraging a virtualized environment named NFV Infrastructure (NFVI) to provide higher scalability and reduce maintenance costs. Operating the NFVI under stringent availability guarantees is fundamental to ensure the proper functioning of the VNFaaS against software attacks and failures, as well as common physical device failures. Indeed the availability of a VNFaaS relies on the failure rate of its single components, namely the physical servers, the hypervisor, the VNF software, and the communication network. In this paper, we propose a versatile orchestration model able to integrate an elastic VNF protection strategy with the goal to maximize the availability of an NFVI system serving multiple VNF demands. The elasticity derives from (i) the ability to use VNF protection only if needed, or (ii) to pass from dedicated protection scheme to shared VNF protection scheme when needed for a subset of the VNFs, (iii) to integrate traffic split and load-balancing as well as mastership role election in the orchestration decision, (iv) to adjust the placement of VNF masters and slaves based on the availability of the different system and network components involved. We propose a VNF orchestration algorithm based on Variable Neighboring Search, able to integrate both protection schemes in a scalable way and capable to scale, while outperforming standard online policies."

The extraction of Zn is based on the emulsification of an aqueous solution containing Triton X-114 and HNO3 with diesel oil samples followed by breaking of the emulsion by heating. The aqueous phase obtained after the emulsion breaking was collected and used for Zn quantification by FAAS. The methodology was optimized using a Doehlert design and the system variables were the concentrations of surfactant and HNO3 in the solution employed in the emulsification and the temperature used in the emulsion breaking. The ratio between absorbance and the time required to break the emulsions was taken as response. Two sets of experiments, using different emulsifier agents, were run: the first one using Triton X-100 and the second one using Triton X-114. At optimized conditions, the emulsions were prepared by mixing 10mL of diesel oil with 2mL of a solution containing 5% w/v of Triton X-114 and 15% v/v of HNO3 and broken by heating at 80°C. The proposed analytical procedure was applied in the analysis of six real samples of diesel oil and a recovery test was carried out by spiking the samples with known amounts of Zn (25 and 50μgL−1), added as organometallic oiled standard. Recovery percentages achieved in this test were between 92 and 109%."

The concentration of free amino acids (FAA) in the sourdoughs containing CFEs was higher than the control sourdough, produced without addition of CFEs. The community-level catabolic profiles showed that the highest number of carbohydrates, polymers and carboxylic acids were consumed in the SF sourdough. Breads produced with CFEs were characterized by higher specific volume than the control. The use of CFEs impacted on the profile of volatile organic compounds. Overall, positive correlations were found between some key-aroma compounds and enzyme activities/precursor FAA. The SF bread, characterized by highest level of alcohols, received the highest score for aroma and sweetness in the sensory analysis."

After the enhancement in sensitivity by means of SPME, further improvement in sensitivity was provided by SQT which improves the detection power of conventional FAAS. The easy separation of extracted indium from the media was facilitated using an external magnetic field. Some effective parameters on the development of the method such as pH of the analyte solution, amount of eluent, amount of MNPs were optimized to obtain maximum absorbance value at each optimization step in order to achieve an improved detection power. Under the optimum experimental and instrumental conditions, the enhancement factor of 44 was obtained where the limit of detection and the limit of quantification were found to be 6.02 μg/L and 20.06 μg/L, respectively.

The detection limit for Ag(I) was 2.4μgL−1 and the relative standard deviation was 2.9% for 0.2μgmL−1 Ag(I).

However, the response of GDH gene expression to salinity alterations has not yet been determined in Macrobrachium rosenbergii, a euryhaline prawn. To investigate the possible participatory role of GDH gene in altered salinity conditions, we have cloned and characterized GDH gene from M. rosenbergii (MrGDH) and examined the mRNA expression under salinity exposure. The full-length cDNA of MrGDH contained an open reading frame of 1659 nucleotides. The ELFV and NADP binding sites of GDH protein remained highly conserved with 99% identity within crustacean species. The sequence information of cDNA and gDNA together revealed that the MrGDH gene is encoded by an uninterrupted exon. We have generated the 3D structure of MrGDH protein. The significant expression level of GDH in various tissues of shrimp suggests a functional role of this gene during salinity exposure and adaptation. The results generated in this study validated the MrGDH as a potential biomarker for salinity adaptation and could be the first step towards elucidating mechanistic pathways resides during the salinity exposure and osmoregulation in M. rosenbergii."

The general case is to differentiate the compound function w(z(t))=w∘z(t) with respect to t by applying the chain rule for a first order derivative, or Faà di Bruno’s formula for higher-order ones. Higher-order automatic differentiation (HOAD) is an efficient and accurate technique for derivative calculation along scientific computing codes. Although codes are available for w(z), a special symbolic HOAD is required to compute accurate higher-order derivatives for w∘z(t) in an efficient manner. A thorough evaluation is carried out considering a nontrivial case study in optics to support this assertion.

Volatile compound analysis, determined by SPME–GC–MS, evidenced 3-methyl butanol in MMS, and 2-methyl propanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol in SMS as major compounds. Our findings highlight that S. cerevisiae could influence the composition in amino acids and volatile compounds in fermented sausages, with a strain-dependent activity."

The study addressed the hypothesis that, at same habitat, the two ecotypes exhibit remarkable divergences in adaptive strategies under drought and salinity, and the function of these strategies is compensatory. Leaf samples were collected from each type at the two sites in field. Sections of 2cm×2cm were cut from the middle of fully expanded leaves and fixed in FAA. Leaf anatomical traits (e.g. stomatal density, leaf thickness and vessel diameters) were examined, and leaf mass per area (LMA), relative water content (RWC), proline, K+ and Na+ were measured. Compared with the gray green type (GG), the yellow green type (YG) with relative greater LMA and leaf thickness, lower stomatal density and index exhibited more obvious xerophil-liked anatomical traits, while higher RWC, proline, K+ and K+/Na+ for the GG type suggested that the ability of osmotic adjustment and salt tolerance of the GG type were stronger than the YG type. Stronger xerophytic anatomical traits were the supplementary strategies of the YG type for its low ability of osmotic adjustment and salt tolerance to drought and salinity. Concluding, there exist significant differences in anatomical and physiological strategies between the two ecotypes and the compensatory effects of these strategies enable the two ecotypes coexist at similar habitat."

Only 35min was needed in the whole operation process. Very low LLOQ (Lower limit of quantification: 0.21–5.43nmol/L) for FAA in twelve bitter foods was obtained, with which BTT (bitter taste thresholds) and CABT (content of FAA at BTT level) were newly determined. The ratio of CABT to BTT increased with decreasing of BTT.

After the addition of Mn2+, the absorption intensity of the P2O74−-AgNPs solution decreased drastically, which associated with the changes of solution color from yellow to purple. The observed changes can be attributed to the aggregation of AgNPs induced by Mn2+ because of the ion-templated chelating reaction. The absorption intensity of P2O74−-AgNPs at 403nm is found to be proportional to the concentration of Mn2+ in the range of 0.03–20μM, and the detection limit for Mn2+ is as low as 0.03μM (S/N=3). Due to high affinity toward Mn2+, the P2O74−-AgNPs as a colorimetric sensor displays an excellent selectivity for Mn2+ detection.

The predominant free amino acids at the end of the fermentation were glutamic acid and alanine, both of which are involved in creating a desirable taste. The inoculation of dry sausages with bacterial strains, especially mixed strains, significantly decreased carbonyl formation and sulfhydryl loss in sausages (P<0.05). Both hydrolysis and oxidation led to increased surface hydrophobicity in sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar proteins.

An en route traffic demand model characterizing both the dynamics and the fluctuation of the actual traffic demand is developed, based on which the variation and the uncertainty of the short/medium-term traffic growth are predicted. Building on the demand forecast the Boeing Fuel Flow Method 2 is applied to estimate the fuel consumption and the resulting aviation emissions in the en route airspace. Based on the traffic demand prediction and the en route emissions estimation, an aviation emissions prediction model is built, which can be used to forecast the generation of en route emissions with uncertainty limits. The developed method is applied to a real data set from Hefei Area Control Center for the en route emission prediction in the next 5years, with time granularities of both months and years. To validate the uncertainty limits associated with the emission prediction, this paper also presents the prediction results based on future traffic demand derived from the regression model widely adopted by FAA and Eurocontrol. The analysis of the case study shows that the proposed method can characterize well the dynamics and the fluctuation of the en route emissions, thereby providing satisfactory prediction results with appropriate uncertainty limits. The prediction results show a gradual growth at an average annual rate of 7.74%, and the monthly prediction results reveal distinct fluctuation patterns in the growth."

abstract = "In Ordos Basin low-permeability reservoirs, taking large-scale fracturing (LSF) measures on vertical wells is being a common practice. Thus, it is a significant problem that should be solved urgently about how to estimate productivity of those wells. During the LSF treatments, micro-seismic monitoring (MSM) strongly shows multiple fractures (MF), with arbitrary length and arbitrary angle, develop along the wellbore. However, most of published works on the productivity of vertically fractured wells assumed that the wells contained a single fracture, and few work has been done to focus on MF. In this paper, a comprehensive steady-state productivity equation for a multiple fracture vertical well (MFVW) is proposed under a constant pressure drawdown. First, a mathematical model of the MFVW is established with consideration of multiple factors including stress-sensitivity effect of permeability (SEP), threshold pressure gradient (TPG), fracture angle asymmetry (FAA), fracture length asymmetry (FLA), and fracture conductivity asymmetry (FCA). Then, using conformal mapping and Pedrosa's perturbation, the productivity equation of MFVW is solved. After that, based on real cases from Ordos Basin reservoir, error analysis of the proposed equation is performed. Equation validation is also conducted by comparing the proposed equation with those of conventional wells in literatures. Finally, the effects of some critical parameters on productivity of MFVW are analyzed. Equation validation shows there are good agreements between the proposed productivity equation and those of conventional wells. The results from sensitivity analysis demonstrate the productivity of MFVW increases with the increase of fracture length, fracture conductivity, fracture number, and degree of FLA; it decreases with the increase of TPG value, SEP coefficient, degree of FCA, and degree of FAA. It provides significant references for reservoir engineers in productivity estimations as well as fracturing evaluations of vertically fractured wells in the low-permeability oil reservoirs."

Local tumor progression (LTP) in early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) remains high. Tumor feeding artery ablation (FAA) before target tumor ablation was reported to reduce LTP in patients with HCC >3 cm. The aim of our study is to investigate whether FAA before target tumor ablation may reduce LTP in HCC <3 cm.
Methods
We retrospectively analysis the outcome of patients with HCC <3 cm undergoing FAA before target tumor ablation (N = 17) compared to direct RFA to target tumor alone (N = 35).
Results
FAA significantly reduces LTP (FAA vs. non-FAA: local tumor progression 17.6% vs. 48.6%, p = 0.038), but not in intrahepatic recurrence: 29.4% vs. 25.7%, p = 0.778; or in overall recurrence rate: 41.2% vs. 62.9%, p = 0.14). The cumulative 1-year and 2-year LTP rates in FAA group were 17.6% and 17.6%, while 11.4% and 42.9% in non-FAA group (p = 0.073), respectively. The cumulative overall recurrence rates at 1-year and 2-year were 29.4% and 35.3% in FAA group, while 14.3% and 57.1% in non-FAA group (p = 0.130), respectively.
Conclusions
FAA before target tumor ablation may decrease LTP in HCC <3 cm. Further randomized control study will be helpful for validation."

Total free amino acids decreased after heat treatment indicating the occurrence of the MR. MRPs showed a decrease in pH and an increase in browning intensity as the degree of hydrolysis of hydrolysates increased. The volatiles compounds generated during heat treatment were evaluated using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) with headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) sampling. A total of 40 volatile compounds were identified in all MRPs and their concentration were found to increase with increasing degree of hydrolysis. Pyrazines were the most abundant class of compounds produced as a result of the MR. F-MRP showed the highest peak area intensity for 17 volatile compounds in single hydrolysis treatment followed by heat treatment. There was also no significant difference in those major volatile compounds between F-MRP and P + F-MRP or B + F-MRP from simultaneous hydrolysis treatment after heating. Hence, the use of Flavourzyme® alone to increase the flavour intensity of beef bone extract is recommended. Overall results indicated that enzymatic hydrolysis and MR could be used to modify the flavour characters of beef bone extract."

In the present study, we investigated relative left frontal activity when participants were instructed to use reappraisal and suppression of negative emotion, by measuring frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA). Two electroencephalography (EEG) experiments were conducted; FAA was analyzed while 102 healthy participants (59 men, 43 women) watched negative images after being instructed to perform reappraisal (Experiment 1) and suppression (Experiment 2). Habitual use of reappraisal and suppression was also assessed using the emotion regulation questionnaire (ERQ). The results of Experiment 1 showed that relative left frontal activity was greater when instructed to use reappraisal of negative images than when normally viewing negative images. In contrast, we observed no difference between conditions of instructed suppression and normal viewing in Experiment 2. In addition, in male participants, habitual use of reappraisal was positively correlated with increased relative left frontal activity for instructed reappraisal, while habitual use of suppression did not show a significant correlation with changes in relative left frontal activity for instructed suppression. These results suggest that emotional responses to negative images might be decreased for instructed reappraisal, but not suppression. These findings support previous reports that reappraisal is an effective emotion regulation strategy, compared with suppression."

In addition, hydrological structures and physical dynamics potentially influence the sources of organic matter (e.g., terrestrial versus marine, or fresh material versus detrital material) entering marine food webs. Understanding the significance of the processes that influence marine food webs and ecosystems (e.g., terrestrial inputs, physical dynamics) is crucially important because trophic dynamics are a vital part of ecosystem integrity. This can be achieved by identifying organic matter sources that enter food webs along inshore–offshore transects. We hypothesised that regional hydrological structures over wide continental shelves directly control the benthic trophic functioning across the shelf. We investigated this issue along two transects in the northern ecosystem of the Bay of Biscay (north-eastern Atlantic). Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis (SIA) and fatty acid analysis (FAA) were conducted on different complementary ecosystem compartments that include suspended particulate organic matter (POM), sedimentary organic matter (SOM), and benthic consumers such as bivalves, large crustaceans and demersal fish. Samples were collected from inshore shallow waters (at ∼1m in depth) to more than 200m in depth on the offshore shelf break. Results indicated strong discrepancies in stable isotope (SI) and fatty acid (FA) compositions in the sampled compartments between inshore and offshore areas, although nitrogen SI (δ15N) and FA trends were similar along both transects. Offshore the influence of a permanently stratified area (described previously as a “cold pool”) was evident in both transects. The influence of this hydrological structure on benthic trophic functioning (i.e., on the food sources available for consumers) was especially apparent across the northern transect, due to unusual carbon isotope compositions (δ13C) in the compartments. At stations under the cold pool, SI and FA organism compositions indicated benthic trophic functioning based on a microbial food web, including a significant contribution of heterotrophic planktonic organisms and/or of SOM, notably in stations under the cold pool. On the contrary, inshore and shelf break areas were characterised by a microalgae-based food web (at least in part for the shelf break area, due to slope current and upwelling that can favour fresh primary production sinking on site). SIA and FAA were relevant and complementary tools, and consumers better medium- to long-term system integrators than POM samples, for depicting the trophic functioning and dynamics along inshore–offshore transects over continental shelves."

Such a framework is an important element of an overall commercial human spaceflight safety system. As the industry matures and approaches a time of regular operational flights carrying paying commercial passengers, the time is right to consider the development of an industry-wide safety reporting system focused on operational hazards, incidents, and close calls. Mature safety reporting systems of this nature exist, both in the aerospace sector and in other industries. For example:•The Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) in the United States•The Federal Railroad Authority Confidential Close Call Reporting System•The NASA Safety Reporting System (NSRS)•Aviation Safety Reporting Systems operated by several civil aviation authorities around the globe These successful systems offer a number of lessons learned and operational best practices that might be applied to a prospective commercial human spaceflight safety reporting system. Through a review of these programs, focusing on systems in the U.S., this paper will describe elements of a safety reporting system that might be developed in support of the commercial human spaceflight industry. Factors to be addressed include:•Origins and motivations for the system•Organizational and operational approaches•Treatment of confidentiality, both for reporters' personally identifiable information, and for proprietary or commercially sensitive information•Relationship to lessons learned and safety data exchange programs•Authority to act upon information received One element that these systems often have in common is that they were established following a tragic incident involving the loss of multiple lives.

This study aimed to determine whether the plasma levels of free fatty acid (FFA) are associated with ischemic lesion characteristics in nonarterial-origin embolic stroke.
Materials and methods
We prospectively recruited 254 patients with acute cerebral infarction caused by cardioembolic stroke (CES, n=121) or with embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS, n=133). Plasma levels of FFA were measured during the acute stage (median of 2days after stroke onset). Acute ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging were measured in terms of size, composition, and pattern. Transthoracic echocardiography parameters were evaluated in all patients.
Findings
Plasma levels of FAA were not different in CES and ESUS patients (mEq/L, 0.78±0.52 vs. 0.67±0.61, P=0.120). Echocardiography parameters, including left atrium volume index and E/e', were higher, and the ischemic lesion volume was larger in patients with CES than in those with ESUS. The ischemic lesion volume and the proportion of patients with mixed (small and large) and large cortical lesions increased with FFA quartile in both CES and ESUS groups. In a multivariable analysis, FFA level (coefficient, 5.249; standard error, 3.447; P=0.001), atrial fibrillation (coefficient, 7.673; standard error, 1.855; P<0.001), and fasting glucose (coefficient, 0.104; standard error, 0.023; P<0.001) were associated with ischemic lesion volume in nonarterial-origin embolic stroke.
Conclusion
Elevated plasma FFA levels are associated with larger ischemic lesion volumes and a higher prevalence of large cortical infarcts in patients with nonarterial-origin embolic stroke regardless of the presence of a high-risk cardioembolic source."

abstract = "The objective of this work is to provide a better understanding of helicopter accidents and to identify important areas for different stakeholders to focus their attention and resources for accident prevention. To this end, we undertook Record Linkage of two federal data sources: the FAA civil helicopter registration data and the NTSB accident data. First, the analysis of accident rates and trends shows little progress in accident prevention over the last decade. Second, we find that helicopter accident rates vary significantly by number of main rotor blades, with the four- and six-bladed helicopters having the safest track record. Third, we show that accident rates vary by engine types when controlling for the number of blades. For example, the combination of reciprocating engine and three-bladed (3B) helicopters is associated with one of the highest accident rates. We further examine differences in accident rates between single and twin-engine helicopters, controlling for engine type and number of blades. The worst-in-class in terms of rates are the 5B and 6B single-engine turboshaft helicopters, whereas the worst-offenders in terms of contributing to the total count of accidents are the single-engine 2B reciprocating and turboshaft helicopters. The 4B single-engine turboshaft occupy a safety sweet spot and have the lowest accident rates of all single-engine helicopters. We provide risk ratios for pairwise comparisons and 95% confidence intervals for all accident rates, and discuss possible confounders for these results. The issues here examined lend themselves to a rich set of technical and operational implications, and they deserve careful attention from helicopter operators, regulators, and manufacturers. Any serious effort to improve helicopter safety will entail action on multiple safety levers, including design, operational, and policy-related ones. These actions should be evidence-based and they require better helicopter accident investigations and better data."

In this work a new sample introduction system, the subcritical fluid nebulizer (ScFN) combined with the flame furnace-atomic absorption spectrometry (FF-AAS) was applied for improving the determination of inorganic tin in aqueous solutions. Online preconcentration of tin as Sn-PDC complex was carried out in a HPLC-guard cartridge (5mm length, 2mm diameter) filled with C-18 coated monolithic silica having an absorption capacity of 2.5μg of tin. For preconcentration optimized conditions were achieved at 0.015% (m/v) of APDC and pH5 obtaining a preconcentration factor of 17 using 2.5mL of sample volume. The elution was done by means of subcritical liquid carbon dioxide and methanol with a flow rate of 1.5Lmin−1 which was directly introduced as a dry aerosol into the flame furnace where tin complexes are vaporized and atomized. Applying ScFN-FF-AAS the detection and quantification limits for tin in water were 0.008mgL−1 and 0.024mgL−1, respectively, increasing the power of detection in 325 times compared to the conventional detection limits obtained by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The precision at 1mgL−1 was 1.5% expressed as RSD (N=10). Tin was determined in samples of gunshot residues generated by firing four ammunition brands. The concentrations fluctuated between 52 and 151μgL−1."

All VLYB had values of pH lower than 4.0 and both selected starters remained viable at ca. 8.4logcfu/g throughout storage. All VLYB showed high values of apparent viscosity and water holding capacity. During fermentation, lactic acid bacteria consumed glucose, fructose, and malic acid, which was supplied with grape must. Compared to control vegetable yogurt-like beverages (CVYLB), without bacterial inoculum, an increase of total free amino acids (FAA) was found during fermentation and storage. Also the concentration of polyphenolic compounds and ascorbic acid (ASC) was higher in VLYB compared to CVYLB. This was reflected on the antioxidant activity.

Lactobacillus plantarum growth and acidification in faba bean flour and its fractions were assessed. The anti-nutritional compounds were separated mostly to the fine protein-rich fraction. Fermentation caused the decrease of vicine and convicine contents by more than 91% and significantly reduced trypsin inhibitor activity and condensed tannins (by more than 40% in the protein-rich fraction). No significant (P>0.05) variation was observed for total phenols and phytic acid content.

L’arthroplastie inversée de l’épaule (AIE) jouit d’une popularité de plus en plus grande en raison de l’amélioration des résultats fonctionnels. Cependant, certains patients ont une faible récupération de la flexion antérieure active (FAA) après l’opération. Il a été démontré que cela pouvait être lié au diagnostic initial, à un déficit du deltoïde ou aux amplitudes articulaires pré- et postopératoires, ainsi qu’à l’allongement du bras. L’objectif de cette étude était de déterminer s’il existe d’autres facteurs prédictifs de récupération de la flexion antérieure active après une arthroplastie inversée de l’épaule.
Méthodes
Entre janvier 2011 et janvier 2012, tous les patients, qui avaient bénéficié d’une arthroplastie inversée de l’épaule réalisée par l’un des auteurs, ont été recrutés prospectivement. La population a été divisée en 2 groupes, en fonction de la FAA postopératoire. Une analyse de régression a été réalisée afin de définir les facteurs prédictifs indépendants de la FAA postopératoire. Ces facteurs ont été évalués : âge, sexe, bras dominant, activité du patient, indice de masse corporelle (IMC), diagnostic préopératoire, état du deltoïde, scores de la douleur et de Constant, valeur subjective de l’épaule (SSV), test simple de l’épaule (SST) et résultats radiographiques. Les patients ont été examinés à la 6e semaine et aux 3, 6, 12 et 24e mois.
Résultats
Cent vingt-sept arthroplasties inversées de l’épaule ont été effectuées pendant l’étude. Vingt-trois patients ont été exclus de l’étude en raison du diagnostic préopératoire. Deux patients ont refusé de participer et un patient est décédé ; l’analyse finale a donc porté sur 101 arthroplasties inversées de l’épaule réalisées sur 101 patients. Six semaines après l’opération, une insuffisance de flexion antérieure active était liée à un déficit de force postopératoire du deltoïde. Une année après l’intervention, le manque de FAA était lié au fait que l’intervention concernait le bras non dominant, à un déficit de FAA préopératoire, à l’activité préopératoire, à la valeur subjective de l’épaule et à un mauvais score de Constant controlatéral.
Discussion et conclusions
Cette étude a révélé qu’une arthroplastie inversée de l’épaule du côté non dominant, un déficit de FAA préopératoire, une faible valeur subjective d’épaule et un mauvais score de Constant controlatéral sont des facteurs de risque d’une mauvaise récupération de la flexion antérieure active. Pour améliorer la fonction du bras, il est important de travailler sur la perception qu’a le patient de ses membres supérieurs et de lui enseigner comment lever le bras avant et après l’opération."

However, it is still unclear whether EGb761 can increase insulin sensitivity. The objectives of the present study are to evaluate the effects of EGb761 on insulin sensitivity in an obese and insulin-resistant mouse model, established through chronic feeding of C57BL/6J mice with a high-fat diet (HFD), and to explore potential mechanisms. Mice fed with HFD for 18 weeks (starting from 4 weeks of age) developed obesity, dyslipidemia (as indicated by biochemical measurements of blood glucose, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and free fatty acids (FFA)), and insulin resistance (as determined by the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index), compared to control mice fed with a standard laboratory chow. Oral treatment of the HFD-fed mice with EGb761, at low (100mg/kg), medium (200mg/kg), or high (400mg/kg) doses, via oral gavage (once daily) for 8 weeks (starting from 26 weeks of age) dose-dependently enhanced glucose tolerance in OGTT, and decreased both the insulin levels (by 29%, 55%, and 70%, respectively), and the HOMA-IR index values (by 50%, 69%, and 80%, respectively). EGb761 treatment also ameliorated HFD-induced obesity, dyslipidemia, and liver injury, as indicated by decreases in body weight (by 4%, 11%, and 16%, respectively), blood TC levels (by 23%, 32%, and 37%, respectively), blood TG levels (by 17%, 23%, and 33%, respectively), blood FAA levels (by 35%, 38%, and 46%, respectively), and liver index (liver weight/body weight) values (by 12.8%, 25%, and 28%, respectively) in the low, medium, and high EGb761 dose groups, respectively. In further mechanism studies, EGb761 was found to protect hepatic insulin receptor β and insulin receptor substrate 1 from HFD-induced degradation, and to keep the AMP-activated protein kinase, which plays a crucial role in reducing lipotoxicity, from HFD-induced inactivation. We conclude that EGb761 can effectively reduce HFD-induced insulin resistance and ameliorate other symptoms of the metabolic syndrome."

The procedure involved the preconcentration of 20.0mL of Cd2+ solution at pH 7.5 (0.1molL−1 buffer phosphate) through 70mg of 3-MPTMS-grafted MWCNTs packed into a minicolumn at 6.0mLmin−1.

The 3-MPTMS-grafted MWCNTs provided a 1.68 times improvement in the sensitivity of the Cd2+ FAAS determination compared to the unsilanized oxidized MWCNTs. The following parameters were obtained: preconcentration factor of 31.5, consumptive index of 0.635mL, sample throughput of 14h−1, and concentration efficiency of 9.46min−1. The analytical curve was constructed in the range of 1.0–60.0μgL−1 (r=0.9988), and the detection and quantification limits were found to be 0.15μgL−1 and 0.62μgL−1, respectively. Different types of water samples and cigarette sample were successfully analyzed, and the results were compared using electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS) as reference technique. In addition, the accuracy of proposed method was also checked by analysis of certified reference material NIST SRM 1573a (tomato leaves) and standard reference material NIST SRM 1643e (trace elements in natural waters)."

abstract = "A redox speciation and preconcentration study of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) using a flow injection system with dual mini-columns prepared from cross-linked polymers-poly(methacrylic acid) and polyvinylimidazole was developed. Characterization of organic polymers was performed by using FTIR, SEM, TG, C:H:N and BET measurements. The equilibrium data obtained from Cr(III) adsorption on poly(methacrylic acid) and Cr(VI) on polyvinylimidazole were fitted very well to the dual site Langmuir–Freundlich model, suggesting the presence homogeneous and heterogeneous binding site and providing maximum adsorption capacities of 1.42 and 3.24mgg−1, respectively. The adsorption kinetics data were described by the pseudo-second-order model for both polymers, thus corroborating to isotherm data. The on-line preconcentration/speciation system was operated by loading 18.0mL of a solution containing Cr(III) and Cr(VI) at pH4.0 through the dual mini-columns at a flow rate of 3.0mLmin−1, where Cr(III) was selectively retained on poly(methacrylic acid), while Cr(VI) was retained on polyvinylimidazole. The limits of detection were found to be 0.84 and 1.58μgL−1 for Cr(III) and Cr(VI), respectively. The preconcentration factor (PF), consumptive index (CI) and concentration efficiency (CE) were found to be 47.3/8.6, 0.38/2.1mL and 7.88/1.43min−1 for Cr(III) and Cr(VI), respectively. The developed method was successfully applied to the speciation of chromium in different kinds of water samples. Satisfactory recovery values ranging from 89.9 to 108.3% were obtained."

abstract = "The identification of odor-active sulfur and nitrogen compounds formed during the processing of dry fermented sausages was the objective of this study. In order to elucidate their possible origin, free amino acids (FAAs) were also determined. The volatile compounds present in the dry sausages were extracted using solvent assisted flavor evaporation (SAFE) and monitored by one and two-dimensional gas chromatography with different detectors: mass spectrometry (MS), nitrogen phosphorous (NPD), flame photometric (FPD) detectors, as well as gas chromatography–olfactometry. A total of seventeen sulfur and nitrogen compounds were identified and quantified. Among them, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline was the most potent odor active compound, followed by methional, ethylpyrazine and 2,3-dihydrothiophene characterized by toasted, cooked potato, and nutty notes. The degradation of FAAs, generated during processing, was related to the production of aroma compounds, such as methionine forming methional and benzothiazole while ornithine was the precursor compound for 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline and glycine for ethylpyrazine."

The results showed no significant influence of starter cultures on colorimetric indices. From the olives fermented using yeasts, both with and without association of selected lactic bacteria, we obtained an olive-based paste richer in phenol compounds, carotenoids, and free amino acids, which had a better volatile and sensory profile, characterized by lower amounts of the volatile compounds associable to sensory defects."

Resumen
La faringoamigdalitis aguda (FAA) en el adulto es una de las enfermedades infecciosas más comunes en la consulta del médico de familia. La etiología más frecuente es viral. Dentro de la etiología bacteriana, el principal agente responsable es Streptococcus pyogenes o estreptococo β-hemolítico del grupo A (EBHGA), causante del 5-30% de los casos. En el manejo diagnóstico, las escalas de valoración clínica para predecir la posible etiología bacteriana, son una buena ayuda para seleccionar a qué pacientes se deben practicar las técnicas de detección rápida de antígeno estreptocócico. Es conocido que, en general, sin estas técnicas se tiende al sobrediagnóstico de FAA estreptocócica, con la consiguiente prescripción innecesaria de antibióticos, muchas veces de amplio espectro. Así, con el manejo de las escalas y la técnica de diagnóstico rápido, elaboramos los algoritmos de manejo de la FAA. Los objetivos del tratamiento son acelerar la resolución de los síntomas, reducir el tiempo de contagio y prevenir las complicaciones supurativas locales y no supurativas. Los antibióticos de elección para el tratamiento de la FAA estreptocócica son penicilina y amoxicilina. La asociación de amoxicilina y clavulánico no está indicada en el tratamiento inicial en la infección aguda. Los macrólidos tampoco son un tratamiento de primera elección; su uso debe reservarse para pacientes con alergia a la penicilina. Es importante en nuestro país adecuar tanto el diagnóstico de la FAA bacteriana y la prescripción de antibióticos a la evidencia científica disponible. La implantación de protocolos de actuación en las farmacias comunitarias puede ser de utilidad para identificar y cribar los casos que no requieran tratamiento antibiótico."

abstract = "With over 40 years of publicly accessible and (now) often free satellite-derived information, remote sensing has become part of many people’s everyday vocabulary. Though air travel had commenced many years earlier, here the altitude of the platform meant the sensor systems could neither be (easily) shot down nor (easily) seen passing overhead. Thus, these devices explicitly designed to monitor the earth’s surface could, if so desired, conduct that monitoring without consent of the observed entities. Nonclassified satellite sensing systems now (mostly commercial) sell data with high enough resolution to map individual cars, trees, and even people, and the emerging if controversial use of unmanned aerial vehicles only underscores the importance of understanding the shifting lines of public versus private, with private especially important in US Fourth Amendment claims under case law often moving at a different pace than that of the technology itself. US case law suggests that simple FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) and ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) airspace regulations (including but not limited to ceilings/airspace classes) do not adequately frame the question of privacy. In the United States, fewer than 10 years after the use of thermal imaging in the Waco, Texas Branch Davidian siege, the watershed case of Kyllo versus United States, 533 U.S. 27 (2001) held that thermal imaging constituted a “search” against which individuals had a right to both due process and privacy. But Kyllo’s relevance today places technology more squarely in the public mindset of reasonable privacy expectations, foreshadowing a time in which technology no longer is considered a breach of privacy or due process. So as surveillance technologies become more common, finding and cementing a “bright clear line” of the public/private divide becomes more critical and more challenging for basic, applied, and operational research and practice."

abstract = "The bioflavonoid quercetin may prevent magnetoliposomes oxidation, preserving their stability. In this work, the interaction between quercetin and asolectin-based magnetoliposomes was investigated by monitoring the hydration degree, vibrational, rotational and translational mobility parameters of the system as well as its thermodynamic properties. The efficiency of the encapsulation of maghemite magnetic nanoparticles was detected by high resolution-continuum source flame atomic absorption spectrometry (HR-CS FAAS). The magnetic behavior of the system was studied by vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) technique. The size and surface charge of magnetoliposomes were detected by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential (ζ-potential) measurements. The influence of quercetin on the physico-chemical parameters of the magnetoliposomes was evaluated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 31P and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques. In vitro antioxidant and antitumoral assays were also performed for the magnetoliposomes. An insertion of quercetin into magnetoliposomes reduced the efficiency of the encapsulation of maghemite nanoparticles by 11%, suggesting a significant interaction between flavonoid and nanoparticles in a specific region of the system. Quercetin discreetly decreased the saturation magnetization of magnetoliposomes, but did not affect the superparamagnetic behavior of the system. 31P and 1H NMR results showed that quercetin did not alter the inverted hexagonal system phase state but decreased lipid polar head mobility. The flavonoid also seems to reorient the choline group above the bilayer phosphate membrane plane, as indicated by ζ-potential system values. FTIR, NMR and DSC responses showed that quercetin disordered the carbonyl and the methylene regions of the magnetoliposomes. Quercetin, as the nanoparticles, seems to be located in the polar head regions of magnetoliposomes, ordering it and diminishing the lipid intermolecular communication in the membrane carbonyl and non-polar regions. The lipid peroxidation of the magnetoliposomes was prevented 8-fold by the presence of quercetin in the system. Also, the flavonoid was responsible for a 45% reduction in the viability of glioma cells. Location and interactions between quercetin and magnetoliposomes components were discussed in order to be correlated with the results of biological activity, contributing to the design of more stable and efficient magnetoliposomes to be applied as contrast and antitumoral agents."

abstract = "This study aimed at evaluating the composition of nineteen traditional Italian legumes and at investigating the potential of the sourdough fermentation with selected lactic acid bacteria to improve the nutritional and functional features. Traditional Italian legumes, all with product certifications and belonging to Phaseolus vulgaris, Cicer arietinum, Lathyrus sativus, Lens culinaris and Pisum sativum species, were used in this study. Seeds were milled, and flours were analyzed for proximate composition and subjected to sourdough fermentation at 30°C for 24h. Lactobacillus plantarum C48 and Lactobacillus brevis AM7 were used as selected starters. Compared to control doughs, without bacterial inoculum, the concentrations of free amino acids (FAA), soluble fibres, and total phenols increased for all legume sourdoughs. Raffinose decreased of up to ca. 64%. During sourdough fermentation, the level of GABA markedly increased and reached values up to 624mg/kg. Condensed tannins decreased. At the same time, almost all legume sourdoughs showed increases of the antioxidant and phytase activities. As shown by PCA analysis based on data of total FAA, GABA, raffinose, soluble/insoluble dietary fibre, condensed tannins and antioxidant and phytase activities, all legume sourdoughs were clearly differentiated from control doughs. The traditional Italian legumes are bio-diverse, and all showed high levels of nutritional elements and suitability for optimal sourdough fermentation. Legume flours subjected to sourdough fermentation would be suitable to be used alone or better in mixture with cereals, and as gluten-free ingredients for making novel and healthy foods."

In bottled Cviček wines of 2008 and 2009 vintages sampled at the producers, residues of eight and twelve pesticides were determined respectively. Consequently, the producers should make an attempt to reduce the number of pesticide residues in wines. The most frequently determined pesticides were fenhexamid, cyprodinil, metalaxyl-M, iprovalicarb, dimethomorph, fludioxonil and pyrimethanil. The concentrations of pesticide residues in samples did not exceed the proposed maximum residue limits (MRLs). The highest concentration in 2008 was determined for iprovalicarb (0.20 mg L−1) and in 2009 for fenhexamid (0.31 mg L−1). Copper levels in the Cviček wines were definitely too high and 17 samples in 2008 and seven in 2009 exceeded the MRL. The microbiological stability of the wines was poor and should be improved. However, the levels of biogenic amines in the traded Cviček and Blaufränkisch wines were low. Furthermore, we only detected 4-ethylguaiacol and 4-ethylphenol above the LOQ (limit of quantification) in three Blaufränkisch wines in concentrations of 81–152 μg L−1 and 149–435 μg L−1. These results together with Brettanomyces spp. yeast detection in two Cviček wines signify that producers should pay more attention to the both issues."

These species were chosen because they are very important from both the economic and consumers points of view. In order to obtain the elemental content of the essential and toxic elements present in the samples, two elemental techniques were used EDXRF and FAAS. No significant differences were found in what concerns the essential elements. Regarding toxic elements, higher concentrations of Cd, Hg and Pb were systematically found between the samples of a given fish farming industry and the fish caught in the sea in the same region. Despite these differences, no values above the recommended regulations were found."

These amides have been reported in plasma and in other organs of the body, while their detection or presence in the urine is still unknown. Therefore, the focus of the current study was to detect and analyze FAAs qualitatively in urine samples of alcoholics. Furthermore, the effects of Tinospora cordifolia (hepatoprotective medicinal plant) intervention on FAA levels in moderate alcoholics were also analyzed. In the study, asymptomatic chronic alcoholics (n = 22) without chronic liver disease and nonalcoholic healthy volunteers (n = 24) with a mean age of 39 ± 2.0 years were selected. The first-pass urine and fasting blood samples were collected in the morning on day 0 and day 14 after T. cordifolia water extract (TCE) treatment and analyzed using automated biochemistry analyzer and HPLC-QTOF-MS. Results indicated the increased levels of serum triglycerides, cholesterol, and liver function enzymes in alcoholic subjects, which were significantly down-regulated by TCE intervention. Multivariate discrimination analysis of QTOF-MS data showed increased urinary levels of oleoamide (2.55-fold), palmitamide (5.6-fold), and erucamide (1.6-fold) in alcoholics as compared to control subjects. Levels of oleamide (1.8-fold), palmitamide (1.7-fold), and linoleamide (1.5-fold) were found to be increased in plasma. Treatment with TCE in alcoholics (3.0 g lyophilized water extract/day) significantly decreased the plasma and urinary levels of all FAAs except linoleamide. The HPLC-QTOF-MS approach for FAAs analysis in both urinary and plasma samples of alcoholics worked very well. Moreover, findings (i.e., increased levels of FAAs in urine and in plasma) further support other findings that these amides play a very important role in alcoholism. Further, like our previous findings, TCE proved its hepatoprotective effect against alcoholism not only by lowering the levels of these detected FAAs, but also by decreasing the level of liver-specific enzymes and lipids."

The cadmium ion in aqueous solution was converted to CdI42− and was then extracted with 160μL of 1-undecanol containing cationic surfactant of methyltrioctylammonium chloride (0.2mol/L). When the extraction was completed, the sample vial was cooled in an ice bath for 5min. The solidified extract was transferred into a conical vial where it melted immediately. It was then diluted to 250μL upon addition of ethanol, and 100μL of it was analyzed by flow injection flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FI-FAAS). Factors that influence the extraction and ion pair formation, such as pH, concentration of iodide and methyltrioctylammonium chloride, extraction time, sample volume, and ionic strength were optimized. Under the optimized conditions, a preconcentration factor of 640, detection limit of 0.0079μg/L and good relative standard deviation of ±5.4% at 5μg/L were obtained. The procedure was applied to tap water, well water, and sea water; and accuracy was assessed through recovery experiment and independent analysis by graphite atomic absorption spectrometry. The accuracy was also evaluated through analyses of certified reference ore."

An enhancement factor of 40.2 was achieved with 25mL sample. The limit of detection (LOD) and quantification obtained under the optimum conditions were 12.5 and 41.0μgL−1, respectively. To validate the proposed methods two certified reference materials 681-I and BCR No. 288 were analyzed and the results were in good agreement with the certified values.

The results indicated that the contents of crude and soluble proteins, total phenol and flavonoid all increased distinctly, while trypsin inhibitor (TI) content decreased after fermentation. There was a slight difference in the total amino acids TAA profile between SBM and fermented soybean meal (FSBM), while the free amino acids (FAA) differed significantly. The result of high performance capillary electrophoresis analysis indicated that there were more soluble components in FSBM than that in SBM. Analysis of antioxidant activities showed that the reducing ability, scavenging DPPH and ABTS radical abilities of FSBM were all stronger than that of SBM. In addition, FSBM has been found having a strong inhibition on angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) measured by HPLC revealing FSBM has antihypertensive activity. These results suggest that SSF with Bacillus subtilis can substantially improve both the nutritional quality and bioactivity of SBM."

In Experiment 2, nulliparous Nelore heifers (N = 617) were evaluated for BCS and received a CIDR and estradiol benzoate (2.0 mg) on Day 0. On Day 7, all heifers received PGF2α (12.5 mg). On Day 9, CIDR inserts were removed and all heifers received estradiol cypionate (0.6 mg) and 200 IU eCG. All heifers received TAI on Day 11 (48 h after CIDR removal). Pregnancy/TAI was different (P = 0.04) between FAA-positive and FAA-negative bulls (33.7% vs. 40.7%, respectively).

The evaluation of metal cations extraction was performed by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) on the remaining solutions. The new cross-linked polymers were tested for their ability to extract Zn(II), Cd(II) and Fe(III) from aqueous phase at room temperature. FT-IR measurements have clearly demonstrated the interaction between metal and ligands in the matrix polymers. The new materials PS-NH-DCDEE and PS-NH-TCEP exhibited high selectivity towards Fe3+ and Zn2+ with levels of extraction yields between 90 and 98%. Although after five consecutive adsorption–desorption cycles, no obvious change in the adsorption capacity of the polymers was found, which suggests that the obtained materials were suitable for the effective removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions."

abstract = "A relatively rapid, accurate and precise solid phase extraction method is presented for the determination of cadmium(II) and lead(II) in various food and water samples. Quantitation is carried out by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The method is based on the retention of the trace metal ions on Dowex Marathon C, a strong acid cation exchange resin. Some important parameters affecting the analytical performance of the method such as pH, flow rate and volume of the sample solution; type, concentration, volume, flow rate of the eluent; and matrix effects on the retention of the metal ions were investigated. Common coexisting ions did not interfere on the separation and determination of the analytes. The detection limits (3σb) for Cd(II) and Pb(II) were found as 0.13 and 0.18μgL−1, respectively, while the limit of quantification values (10σb) were computed as 0.43 and 0.60μgL−1 for the same sequence of the analytes. The precision (as relative standard deviation was lower than 4% at 5μgL−1 Cd(II) and 10μgL−1 Pb(II) levels, and the preconcentration factor was found to be 250. The accuracy of the proposed procedure was verified by analysing the certified reference materials, SPS-WW2 Batch 108 wastewater level 2 and INCT-TL-1 tea leaves, with the satisfactory results. In addition, for the accuracy of the method the recovery studies (⩾95%) were carried out. The method was applied to the determination of the analytes in the various natural waters (lake water, tap water, waste water with boric acid, waste water with H2SO4) and food samples (pomegranate flower, organic pear, radish leaf, lamb meat, etc.), and good results were obtained. While the food samples almost do not contain cadmium, they have included lead at low levels of 0.13–1.12μgg−1."

The nanocomposites were synthesized and characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and textural data. The analytical method was based on percolate 24.0mL of Cr3+ and Cr6+ binary solutions through mini-columns packed with 50.0mg of nanocomposites at flow rate of 6.0mLmin−1. While Cr3+ specie is retained onto multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-poly(methacrylic acid), the Cr6+ is eluted from MWCNT-poly(4-vinylpyridine) using 2.5molL−1 HNO3 at flow rate of 4.0mLmin−1 directly toward FAAS detector. By switching the central part of injector, the elution of Cr3+ is carried out and Cr6+ is again preconcentrated into MWCNT-poly(vinylpyridine). The effect of variables related to preconcentration and speciation method was evaluated by a full 24 factorial design. The analytical curve for Cr3+ was ranged from 1.7 to 150.0μgL−1 (Radj=0.999) while the limit of detection, enrichment factor, and consumption index were found to be 0.47μgL−1, 31.5, and 0.76mL, respectively.

abstract = "Circadian rhythms in mammals are regulated by a system of circadian oscillators that includes a light-entrainable pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and food-entrainable oscillators (FEOs) elsewhere in the brain and body. In nocturnal rodents, the SCN promotes sleep in the day and wake at night, while FEOs promote an active state in anticipation of a predictable daily meal. For nocturnal animals to anticipate a daytime meal, wake-promoting signals from FEOs must compete with sleep-promoting signals from the SCN pacemaker. One hypothesis is that FEOs impose a daily rhythm of inhibition on SCN output that is timed to permit the expression of activity prior to a daytime meal. This hypothesis predicts that SCN activity should decrease prior to the onset of anticipatory activity and remain suppressed through the scheduled mealtime. To assess the hypothesis, neural activity in the SCN of mice anticipating a 4–5-h daily meal in the light period was measured using FOS immunohistochemistry and in vivo multiple unit electrophysiology. SCN FOS, quantified by optical density, was significantly reduced at the expected mealtime in food-anticipating mice with access to a running disk, compared to ad libitum-fed and acutely fasted controls. Group differences were not significant when FOS was quantified by other methods, or in mice without running disks. SCN electrical activity was markedly decreased during locomotion in some mice but increased in others. Changes in either direction were concurrent with locomotion, were not specific to food anticipation, and were not sustained during longer pauses. Reduced FOS indicates a net suppression of SCN activity that may depend on the intensity or duration of locomotion. The timing of changes in SCN activity relative to locomotion suggests that any effect of FEOs on SCN output is mediated indirectly, by feedback from neural or systemic correlates of locomotion."

Differences in possible topics, subjects, and technology characteristics drive researchers to search for different types of solutions to what seem to be familiar problems. A research consortium sponsored by the United States (US) Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Center of Excellence for Commercial Space Transportation (COE CST), was established in 2010 to facilitate collaborative research activities with a specific emphasis on the commercial aspects of space-related research. Major research areas have been identified that encompass as many possible research topics as could be imagined (as they are pertinent to commercial space activities). The first research domain focuses on the operational challenges of integrating commercial space activities into the national air space (NAS), the management of space “traffic” on-orbit, and the safe operations of spaceports. The second research area most resembles the governmental space research activities, with an emphasis on engineering of systems, subsystems, operations, and analyses surrounding the vehicle and its safety. The third research area encircles the human as a part of the space activity. Research on physiology, human factors, human rating, and training are some of the primary concerns of this domain. Finally, research based in the social sciences are included to study the markets, policy, law, and regulatory environments that will be required to ensure long-term viability of the evolving commercial space industries."

We describe four main issues in adapting such protocols: exposing a network server for receiving TCP session data; the creation of server-side semantic proxies to process the messages and adapt to a serverless environment; service discovery to enable the discovery of necessary services on the network and to maintain the network state; and finally support for multicast interfaces for the transportation of messages amongst peers. We show that our system, called GUMP, can be used to support such protocol adaptations and to illustrate we use GUMP to implement an XMPP proxy allowing existing off-the-shelf XMPP client software to dynamically create and operate multi-user chat sessions in a serverless network environment. We then present two sets of results that show how appropriate discovery systems and transport protocols can dramatically increase the success of protocols, such as XMPP, within a mobile wireless networked environment. Specifically, we first demonstrate that a GUMP supported discovery system, INDI, can significantly increase the success rates and decrease latency of discovering services through profiles, caching and retrying schemes. Second, we show that success rates for XMPP transmission of messages can be vastly improved through the use of multicast as apposed to TCP within the mobile environment. These two factors provide strong empirical support for the justification of GUMP in its ability to adapt between a client–server and serverless world."

Differences were also found between the soft and durum wheat flours. After 8 h of fermentation (1 day), a different behaviour of the microbiome components was observed. All the mature sourdoughs harboured a core microbiome constituted by 4 species (Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus brantae, Pediococcus argentinicus and Weissella cibaria). Based on the type of flour, the relative abundance of each core species differed among sourdoughs. In addition, other dominant lactic acid bacteria species were variously detected in sourdoughs. Mature sourdoughs showed marked variations for the concentrations of glucose, fructose, maltose, lactic and acetic acids, ethanol and free amino acids (FAA). Specific correlations (r > 0.7; FDR < 0.05) were found between the microbiome and total phenols, fibres and metabolome of mature sourdoughs.

Methods: Blood samples and airborne samples from 45 nielloware workers were collected from nielloware workplaces in Nakhon Sri Thammarat Province, Thailand. Lead levels were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS), at a wavelength of 283.3 nm. FAAS was used especially adequate for metals at relatively high concentration levels. Results: The geometric mean of the 45 airborne lead levels was 81.14 μg/m3 (range 9.0-677.2 μg/m3). The geometric mean blood lead level of the 45 workers was 16.25 μg/dL (range 4.59-39.33 μg/dL). No worker had a blood lead level > 60 μg/dL. A statistically significantly positive correlation was found between airborne lead level and blood lead levels (r = 0.747, p < 0.01). It was observed that personal hygiene was poor; workers smoked and did not wash their hands before drinking or eating. It was concluded that these behaviors had a significant correlation with blood lead levels (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Improvements in working conditions and occupational health education are required due to the correlation found between blood leads and airborne lead levels."

Nutrition during fetal life and early childhood is thought to play a crucial role in the risk for developing metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases in the future adult and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) intake may play a role in the development of obesity. The aim of this study was to compare the breast milk amino acid profiles of obese and normal weight (control) breast-feeding mothers.
Methods
Fifty obese and 50 control breast-feeding mothers were enrolled. Age and parity were similar in both groups. Breast milk samples were collected at the end of the first month of lactation. Free amino acid (FAA) concentrations in breast milk were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Comparisons between groups were performed using a two-tailed paired t test.
Results
We analyzed 45 breast milk samples from each group. Body mass index was 34.3 ± 3.9 kg/m2 in the obese group and 21.6 ± 1.4 kg/m2 in the control group (P < 10−4). BCAA concentrations were higher in breast milk of obese mothers (95.5 ± 38.2 μM versus 79.8 ± 30.9 μM; P = 0.037), as was tyrosine concentration (13.8 ± 7.1 μM versus 10.6 ± 5.2 μM; P = 0.016).
Conclusion
The mature breast milk of obese mothers contained 20% more BCAA and 30% more tyrosine than breast milk of control mothers. Whether altered breast milk FAA profile affects metabolic risk in the breast-fed child remains to be explored."

We show that open-system behaviour can be identified by analysing the co-variance between FAA and THAA fractions and the relative THAA composition and we also provide further evidence that, for taphonomic reasons, dating the molluscan fauna does not necessarily yield age information for the sedimentary units when these contain derived shells."

abstract = "Flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) still keeps its importance despite the relatively low sensitivity; because it is a simple and economical technique for determination of metals. In recent years, atom traps have been developed to increase the sensitivity of FAAS. Although the detection limit of FAAS is only at the level of µg/mL, with the use of atom traps it can reach to ng/mL. Slotted quartz tube (SQT) is one of the atom traps used to improve sensitivity. In atom trapping mode of SQT, analyte is trapped on-line in SQT for few minutes using ordinary sample aspiration, followed by the introduction of a small volume of organic solvent to effect the revolatilization and atomization of analyte species resulting in a transient signal. This system is economical, commercially available and easy to use. In this study, a sensitive analytical method was developed for the determination of lead with the help of SQT atom trapping flame atomization (SQT-AT-FAAS). 574 Fold sensitivity enhancement was obtained at a sample suction rate of 3.9mL/min for 5.0min trapping period with respect to FAAS. Organic solvent was selected as 40µL of methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK). To obtain a further sensitivity enhancement inner surface of SQT was coated with several transition metals. The best sensitivity enhancement, 1650 fold enhancement, was obtained by the Ta-coated SQT-AT-FAAS. In addition, chemical nature of Pb species trapped on quartz and Ta surface, and the chemical nature of Ta on quartz surface were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman Spectroscopy. Raman spectrometric results indicate that tantalum is coated on SQT surface in the form of Ta2O5. XPS studies revealed that the oxidation state of Pb in species trapped on both bare and Ta coated SQT surfaces is +2. For the accuracy check, the analyses of standard reference material were performed by use of SCP SCIENCE EnviroMAT Low (EU-L-2) and results for Pb were to be in good agreement with the certified value using SQT-AT-FAAS and Ta coated-SQT."

The new sorbentsorbent was characterized by FTIR, SEM, and surface area values. The uptake behavior of Cd(II) ions onto this sorbent was evaluated from kinetic data, pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models, as well as from Langmuir, Freundlich and Langmuir–Freundlich adsorption isotherms. The maximum sorption capacity of 4.59mgg−1 was estimated by the Langmuir–Freundlich model with fast kinetics for the sorption of Cd(II) described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. After characterization, the sorbent was packed in a mini-column, and a fast flow injection preconcentration system for Cd(II) determination by FAAS was developed. The best Cd(II) preconcentration condition, obtained by means of factorial design and response surface methodology, was achieved at pH 9.36 and a flow rate of 10mLmin−1 followed by elution with 1.0molL−1 nitric acid. By using 78s preconcentration time, fast and highly sensitive determination of Cd(II) ions could be achieved with a limit of quantification of 0.20μgL−1, preconcentration factor of 26, consumption index of 0.5mL, concentration efficiency of 20min−1, and sample throughput of 39h−1. The repeatability for 10 replicate determinations was found to be 7.8 and 2.5% for Cd(II) ion concentrations of 5.0 and 100.0μgL−1, respectively. The new sorbent efficiency for the interference-free preconcentration of Cd(II) ions was assessed by analysis of tap, mineral and lake waters, as well as synthetic seawater and normal saline waters. Furthermore, complex samples, such as biological samples, could be analysed by the proposed method in accordance with the accuracy attested by analysis of certified reference materials, TORT-2 (lobster hepatopancreas), and DOLT-4 (dogfish liver)."

The procedure developed in this work allowed samples with different °API values (17.4–30.2) originating from the post-salt to be studied. Under the operational conditions of ICP-OES, robust plasma (Mg II/Mg I>10 for the axial and radial configurations) was obtained based on evaluation of the ratio of the Mg II/Mg I intensities. Furthermore, yttrium was used as an internal standard, resulting in as little interference with the analytical signal as possible. This procedure achieved detection limits on the order of 0.99mgL−1, 0.025mgL−1, 0.33μgL−1, 0.06ngL−1 and 0.26μgL−1 for Na, Ca, Mg, Sr and Fe, respectively. The accuracy of the procedure was confirmed through addition/recovery tests (91–120%) and through comparison with the results obtained with flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The modified standard test method of ASTM D 6470-99 extraction was compared with microwave-assisted acid digestion and was found to achieve extractions higher than 92.44% for Na and 81.06% for Sr from two of the analysed extracts. Finally, the chloride concentrations obtained via potentiometric titration and ICP-OES (through the analysis of chloride with its counterions) in the aqueous extract indicated a high correlation between Na, Ca, Mg, Sr and Fe and chloride (105.10%, 99.33% and 102.12% for the evaluated samples)."

With regard of fuel reliability, the chemical characterization combined with environmental protection is particularly important in the uranium production cycle or in the nuclear fuel cycle, subject to an increasing number of international conventions and protocols. The performance of nuclear fuel in reactors depends mainly on the chemical composition of its impurities and its estimation is important from the point of view of neutron economy. Among the instrumental analytical techniques commonly used for the determination of elemental impurities in uranium compounds spectrometric techniques are commonly used, such as; FAAS, GFAAS, ICP OES and ICP-MS. Usually, it is necessary in a previous uranium separation and preconcentration of the impurities for elemental determination.

No patients were graded as FAA1, 8 as FAA2, 18 as FAA3, 19 as FAA4 and 5 as FAA5. There was a trend for the FAA score to increase with injury severity, as measured by ISS i.e. vocational functional outcome was worse with more severe injuries, although this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.095). Multiple amputee patients had significantly higher FAA grades (p<0.001) and were all FAA 4 or 5. Of the 33 patients who had returned to work, 8 were FAA2, 12 FAA3 and 12 FAA4. The mean SF-36 scores for Physical Component Summary (PCS) increased significantly from 36.4 to 43.4 (p=0.001) with rehabilitation, while Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 53.0 and remained similar at 53.6 (p=0.987). MCS scores were similar in these patients to the normal population, 50 (SD 10).
Conclusions
This study is the first to report the outcomes, with regards to return to work, of the UK military amputees injured in Afghanistan and Iraq Soldiers are surviving more severe and complex injuries than before and the majority are able to return successfully to military work. SF-36 PCS scores improve significantly with rehabilitation, and while MCS scores remain constant, the initial assessments are comparable with a normal population."

The chapter deals that every flight during the training should have a precise purpose assigned by the instructor. In aviation, an actual flight plan is a different thing. It is a very detailed list containing the times, altitudes, headings, fuel consumption figures, etc. for all the segments (legs) composing the flight. Therefore, for cross-country flights, this is an essential tool that will help the pilot stay ahead of the game and be constantly aware of his position and his options in case of emergency. Officially filing the flight plan, calling a Flight Service Station (FSS) and dictating the plan on the phone to a controller, or submitting it via the internet, provides additional advantages. Once the FSS (and ultimately the FAA) knows where, when, and along which route one is going. They can keep an eye on pilot so to speak. They can track the pilot on their radars, a service called flight following. At least, if the pilot is flying too low for them to follow, they can check that actually the pilot has reached the destination at the estimated arrival time or within a reasonable period."

The section deals with the last flight, the check-ride, with the FAA examiner, which seems to be time of great tension and a little fear. It is a flight meant to summarize all the phases of flight, where it is asked to put all the knowledge that has been gained during the training into practice. This section explores the possibility of producing audio signals using, Output Compare modules of the PIC24. When in the pulse width modulation (PWM) mode and in combination with more or less sophisticated low-pass filters, the Output Compare modules can be used effectively. It is rather used as digital-to-analog converters to produce analog output signals. If it is managed to modulate the analog signal with frequencies that fall into the range that is recognized by the human ear, approximately between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. The pulse is produced at regular intervals (T) typically provided by a timer and its period register. The pulse width (Ton) is not fixed but is programmable and it could vary between 0% and 100% of the timer period. The ratio between the pulse width (Ton) and the signal period (T) is called the duty cycle."

On the other hand, FAA content continuously decreased in kefir-whey-cheese whereas it increased in whey-cheese. The cheese samples produced by freeze–dried kefir as starter culture were characterised as high-quality products during the preliminary sensory evaluation and they were accepted by the panel.

The activation of carbon was achieved by chemical activation and the tyre-based activated carbon was used as a sorbent for solid phase extraction. The prepared activated carbon was characterized using the scanning electron microscope (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy. Moreover, optimization of the proposed method was performed by the two-level full factorial design (FFD). The FFD was chosen in order to fully investigate the effect of the experimental variables (pH, eluent concentration and sample flow rate) that significantly influence the preconcentration procedure. In this model, individual factors are considered along with their interactions. In addition, modelling of the experiments allowed simultaneous variation of all experimental factors investigated, reduced the required time and number of experimental runs which consequently led to the reduction of the overall required costs. Under optimized conditions, the limits of detection and quantification (LOD and LOQ) ranged 0.66–2.12 μg L−1and 1.78–5.34 μg L−1, respectively and the enrichment factor of 25 was obtained. The developed SPE/FAAS method was validated using CWW-TM-A and CWW-TM-B wastewater standard reference materials (SRMs). The procedure showed to be accurate with satisfactory recoveries ranging from 92 to 99%. The precision (repeatability) was lower than 4% in terms of the relative standard deviation (%RSD). The developed method proved to have the capability to be used in routine analysis of heavy metals in domestic and industrial wastewater samples. In addition, the developed method can be used as a final step (before being discharged to the rivers) in wastewater treatment process in order to keep our water bodies free from toxic metals."

The variables that play an important role on the performance of both preconcentration methods were thoroughly optimized by means of factorial design. Under optimized condition, an aliquot of 45.0mL of sample was preconcentrated onto 25mg of magnetic nanoparticles during 1min following the elution with 0.5mL of 2.5molL−1 HCl.

The harmonic and anharmonic vibrational frequencies of the most stable cis-enol and keto forms were calculated at the B3LYP/6-311++G∗∗ level of theory. The calculated frequencies and the Raman and IR intensities were compared with the experimental results. According to the theoretical calculations the hydrogen bond strength for BrAA, ClAA, AA, and FAA are 90.5, 87.4, 75.8, and 65.9kJ/mol, respectively. These results are in agreement with the vibrational and 1H NMR spectroscopy results. Natural bond orbital (NBO) and Atoms-in-Molecule (AIM) analyses were also used to investigate the nature of intramolecular hydrogen bond in the molecules."

The first sub-sample was manually cleaned whereas the second one was triple rinsed with deionized water and left to dry. Subsequently, the samples were milled and digested in a close microwave system with 8mL of HNO3 (1:1) and 1mL of 30% H2O2. In all samples Cu, Fe and Zn were determined using GFAAS and FAAS techniques. Each sample was analyzed twice. Sampling, sample preparation and analytical uncertainty were calculated using ANOVA, RANOVA, modified RANOVA and range statistics methods. Sampling and sample preparation uncertainty varied from 3.8 to 19.8% and from 3.6 to 11.2%, respectively. For all the elements examined analytical uncertainty was below 1.1%. The comparison of element concentrations in manually cleaned and rinsed samples showed that rinsed samples were enriched in Cu and Zn, as opposed to manually cleaned that in turn displayed raised levels of Fe. However, except for Zn, these differences were not statistically significant."

Mitt. moss species and their duplicates were collected from the same sampling sites in September of 2014, and March and July of 2015. After each sampling campaign, the samples (primary sample – S1 and its duplicate – S2) were divided into two equal and homogenous samples (P1 and P2) for preparation. The P1 samples were subjected to dry cleaning whereas the P2 samples to wet cleaning. After digestion in a closed microwave system, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn were determined in all these samples using FAAS and GFAAS techniques. The highest concentrations were noted in July samples. However, the average element contents were as follows: July > March ≈ September for Cu and Mn, July > March > September for Fe, and July ≈ March > September for Zn. The level of sampling period uncertainty was the highest for Fe and Mn, and the lowest for Cu. In 2014 the measurement uncertainty (srmeas) of Fe, Mn and Zn (expressed as a sum of sampling (srsamp), preparation (srprep) and analytical (sranal) uncertainty) was mainly affected by intra-site variability, so the contribution of sampling uncertainty to the srmeas values was the highest. In 2015 the cleaning procedure had the main impact of the measurement uncertainty of Fe and Zn, so the srmeas values were mainly loaded by the srprep values. For Cu and Mn the same relationship between the srsamp and srprep values was maintained in 2014 and 2015. In all cases, the sum of sampling, preparation and analytical uncertainty did not exceed 35%. However, high values of preparation uncertainty of Fe and Zn obtained in 2015 should make us more critical of the results from the analysis of mosses collected within different sampling periods and cleaned using different wet/dry cleaning methods."

The progressive conversion of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) and production of thiobarbituric acid (TBA) and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) were found during the entire period of storage. Furthermore, the advantages of reducing moisture loss, inhibiting oxidation of lipids, depressing TMAO breakdown and TVB-N accumulation were observed, while the browning reaction exhibited no significant decrease for the TP samples.

The method was validated with respect to selectivity, linearity, limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ), recovery, precision, and stability. LOQs of most FFAs were lower than 1 ng/mL, and 5′-nucleotides were in the range of 5–20 ng/mL. FAAs and 5′-nucleotides in ten shiitake mushrooms from different cultivate areas were further analyzed. Results showed that the contents of cytidine 5′-monophosphate, adenosine 5′-monophosphate, lysine, threonine, arginine were significantly different. Principal component analysis showed clear discrimination of origins, seasons and species. Thus, the proposed method is suitable for the fast discrimination of species and geographical origins of shiitake mushrooms."

Insights were drawn on the complex rebound (recovered) and residual (unrecovered) deformation trends of granular materials due to passing of each of the 6-wheel Boeing 777 (B777) and the 4-wheel Boeing 747 (B747) gears for various combinations of loading (stress history effects), wander positions, and wander sequences. Measured field layer deformations and the accumulation rates could only be achieved when the magnitudes and variations of stress states in the granular layers, number of load applications, gear load wander patterns, previous loading stress history effects, trafficking speed or loading rate effects, and finally, principal stress rotation effects due to moving wheel loads were properly accounted for. Accordingly, measured transverse profiles and multi-depth deflectometer data were used to create individual pass residual deformation transverse profiles. The created transverse profiles were then combined with stress history effects to predict the residual transverse profiles for the test sections with P209/P154 granular base/subbase layers. The proposed method emphasizes the use of the previous load location and stress history of the pavement element to develop the residual deformation in that element. Calculation of the residual deformation in each element across the pavement surface results in the development of the complete permanent deformation transverse profile. This technique can be applied to estimate the transverse rutting profile of the pavement after trafficking based on any combination of applied wander and traffic direction."

Levels of the nutrients and toxic elements were determined in samples of soils and coffee tissues from two transitional organic farms by atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The metals in soil samples were extracted by Mehlich1 and USEPA-3050 procedures. Coffee samples from both farms presented relatively high levels of Cd, Zn and Cu (0.75, 45.4 and 14.9μgg−1, respectively), but were still below the limits specified by the Brazilian Food Legislation. The application of statistical methods showed that this finding can be attributed to the addition of high amounts of organic matter during the flowering tree period which can act on the bioavailability of metal ions in soils."

The optimization involved the study of the following variables: pH and concentration of buffer solution, concentrated hydrogen peroxide volume and irradiation time. The evaluation of sample degradation was monitored by measuring the absorbance at the maximum wavelength of red wine (530 nm). Using the experimental conditions established during the optimization (irradiation time of 30 min, oxidant volume of 2.5 mL, pH 10, and a buffer concentration of 0.15 mol L−1), this procedure allows the determination of iron and manganese with limits of detection of 30 and 22 μg L−1, respectively, for a 5 mL volume of digested sample. The precision levels, expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD), were 2.8% and 0.65% for iron and 2.7% and 0.54% for manganese for concentrations of 0.5 and 2.0 mg L−1, respectively. Addition/recovery tests for evaluation of the accuracy were in the ranges of 90%–111% and 95%–107% for iron and manganese, respectively. This digestion procedure has been applied for the determination of iron and manganese in six wine samples. The concentrations varied from 1.58 to 2.77 mg L−1 for iron and from 1.30 to 1.91 mg L−1 for manganese. The results were compared with those obtained by an acid digestion procedure and determination of the elements by FAAS. There was no significant difference between the results obtained by the two methods based on a paired t-test (at 95% confidence level)."

abstract = "Imbalances in metals have emerged as playing a role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Monitoring of metal levels could serve as a biomarker of presence, or future development, of this disease. To this end, we evaluated the ability of flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) to assess the concentrations of Ca, Fe and Zn in hair of PD patients and to investigate if there was an association with age and disease duration. Hair samples were collected from 26 clinically-diagnosed PD patients, and 33 healthy individuals. Concentrations of Ca and Fe were lower in PD patients when compared to control, whereas, a higher concentration of Zn was detected in PD patients. Levels of Ca and Fe did not vary with age nor with the duration of PD. While Zn did not present variation with duration of the disease, there was a correlation with age as PD patients older than 65 years exhibited a higher concentration of Zn than controls. We conclude that FAAS is useful for detecting differences in Fe, Ca and Zn in hair samples of patients with PD. Hair samples required for this method are easy to collect, and the technique relies on a simple method of digestion of the organic matrix. The ease of use of FAAS should allow for more frequent monitoring of metallic levels in patients in a variety of small clinical situations, thereby offering the hope of allowing systematic tracking of metal levels as the disease progresses, or prior to the defining motor symptoms."

It is based on the selective reaction of As(III) with ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (APDC) followed by sorption of the formed complex under a minicolumn containing polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Afterward, arsenic sorbed has been eluted using a 2 mol L−1 hydrochloric acid solution. The preconcentration system was optimized employing multivariate techniques. A two-level full factorial design and a Doehlert matrix were performed to determining the critical conditions of the factors: the acidity of the sample, APDC concentration, and sample flow rate. So, the procedure using the optimized conditions allows the determination of As(III) with limits of detection and quantification of 0.02 and 0.07 μg L−1. Total arsenic has been determined after reduction of As(V) using thiourea in acid media and the limits achieved were 0.03 and 0.09 μg L−1, for detection and quantification, respectively. The precision estimated as the relative standard deviation (RSD) was 5.3%, which was calculated using seven replicates of As(III) solution with a concentration of 0.50 μg L−1. The accuracy of the method was confirmed by the analysis of the certified reference material CASS-4 seawater furnished by the National Research Council of Canada-NRCC. The system proposed was employed for speciation analysis of arsenic in five seawater samples collected from Todos os Santos Bay, Salvador, Brazil. The As(III) contents obtained varied from 0.09 to 0.51 and the total arsenic contents varied from 0.20 to 0.66 μg L−1. The results are in agreement with other data reported in the literature."

Experimental parameters that influence Cr (IV) determination efficiency, such as pH, time and interfering ions were studied and optimized. After selective extraction of Cr (VI) in the presence of Cr (III) at pH 5.2, ZnAl-ALA-LDH was dissolved in H2SO4 5 mol·L−1. An interesting property of this material is its immediate dissolution at pH values below 3. The complete ZnAl-ALA-LDH dissolution after adsorption ensured that all Cr (VI) adsorbed was analyzed by FAAS, dispensing the use of eluents during the process and thus decreasing the extraction time. In addition to the selective extraction of Cr (VI), the method also allowed sensitivity increase and interference reduction by preconcentration. Calibration was linear in the range of 20 to 700 μg·L−1 (r2 > 0.99). The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were 7.1 μg·L−1 and 23.6 μg·L−1, respectively.

It explains the importance of redundancy to both design and assessment practices in aviation, but contests redundancy’s ability to accurately translate between them. It suggests that FAA reliability assessments serve a useful regulatory purpose by couching the qualitative work of engineers and regulators in an idiom of calculative objectivity, but cautions that this comes with potentially perverse consequences. For, like many audit-practices, reliability calculations are constitutive of their subjects, and their construal of redundancy shapes both airplanes and aviation praxis."

(ii) FAA patterns and compliance indirectly affect sensitivity to interrogative pressure (Shift scores) through iNLE.

Optimal analytical conditions were attained by using the Mg I 215.4353nm secondary spectral line. An optimal pyrolysis temperature of 1500°C was found for Mg, while the compromise atomization temperature in THGAs (2400°C) was applied for analyte vaporization.

The standards were prepared with exactly known Mg content via solid state fusion of the oxide components of the matrix and analyte. The correlation coefficient (R value) of the linear calibration was not worse than 0.9992. The calibration curves were linear in the dopant concentration range of interest (0.74–7.25mg/gMg), when dosing 3–10mg of the powder samples into the graphite sample insertion boats.

These results revealed that sulfide stress influenced the L. vannamei gills physiological and immune function by damaging histological structure, and confusing osmoregulation, respiratory metabolic and immune capacity."

Only Fe, Cu, Mn and Zn were detected by FAAS in all samples collected. The water quality of Beung Boraphet was medium clean with Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn concentrations well below internationally accepted limits. According to the criteria proposed for sediments by the EPA Region V, Zn and Mn concentrations were within the non-polluted range while Fe and Cu (wet season) concentrations fell into the class of severely polluted sediment. Both P. canaliculata and I. aquatica bioconcentrated more Mn in their tissues than were found in sediments, especially in the wet season. The results of Pearson correlation study and BCF values also indicated similar findings. Only Mn showed the importance of sediment-to-snail concentration and high BCF values in both snails and plants. P. canaliculata exposed to contaminated sediment for two months, showed higher accumulation of metals (Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn) in the digestive tracts and digestive glands than in the foot muscles. Histopathological changes included alterations in the epithelial lining of the digestive tracts, digestive glands and the gills. Loss of cilia and increase in mucous cells were observed in the digestive tracts and gills, while the digestive glands exhibited an increase of dark granules and basophilic cells, and dilation of digestive cells. The results indicated that both P. canaliculata and I. aquatica could be used as biomonitors of sedimentary metal contamination for the Beung Boraphet reservoir."

The adsorption experiments were conducted in a batch adsorption technique. Under the experimental conditions, Cr(VI) adsorption amount was nearly equal to zero, however the adsorption percentage of Cr(III) was in the range of 95–100%. Therefore total chromium was determined after the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) and Cr(VI) was calculated by subtracting Cr(III) concentration from total chromium concentration. The suitable conditions for adsorption and speciation processes were evaluated in terms of pH, eluent type and volume, TIWAC concentration, adsorption and desorption contact time, etc. Adsorption capacity of TIWAC was found to be 61.0mgg−1.

The results of the δ13C of wine ethanol, Rb and Li showed a significant difference between the varieties regardless of the region studied. The δ18O values of water and δ13C of ethanol showed significant differences, regardless of the variety. Discriminant analysis of isotope and minerals values allowed to classify approximately 80% of the wines from the three regions studied."

The effect of different variables on the extraction efficiency such as type and volume of eluent for extraction, solution’s pH for adsorption, sorption and desorption times was evaluated. Under the optimum conditions: type of eluent, HCl (2molL−1); volume of eluent, 5mL; solution’s pH for sorption, 5; sorption time, 90min; desorption time, 125min and breakthrough volume of 750mL were obtained.

The maximum sorption retention capacity of Pb(II) ions on the imprinted polymer was 85.6mgg−1. The prepared ion-imprinted polymer particles have an increased selectivity toward Pb(II) ions over a range of competing metal ions with the same charge and similar ionic radius.

(1) Determine claustrophobia frequency in adults with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) after first CPAP night; (2) determine if claustrophobia influences CPAP non-adherence.
Background
Claustrophobia is common among CPAP-treated OSA adults yet few studies have examined the problem.
Methods
Secondary analysis of prospective, longitudinal study of OSA adults (n = 97). CPAP-Adapted Fear and Avoidance Scale (CPAP-FAAS) collected immediately after CPAP titration polysomnogram. Primary outcome: objective CPAP use at 1week and 1month.
Results
Sixty-three percent had claustrophobic tendencies. Females had higher CPAP-FAAS scores than males. FAAS ≥25, positive score for claustrophobic tendencies, was influential on CPAP non-adherence at 1week (aOR = 5.53, 95% CI 1.04, 29.24, p = 0.04) and less CPAP use at 1month (aOR = 5.06, 95% CI 1.48, 17.37, p = 0.01) when adjusted for body mass index and CPAP mask style.
Conclusion
Claustrophobia is prevalent among CPAP-treated OSA adults and influences short-term and longer-term CPAP non-adherence. Interventions are needed to address this treatment-related barrier."

This study investigated the high temperature durability of a carbon/MVK10 triaxially braided textile composite. The goal was to monitor, analyze and quantify the evolution of physical and chemical aging processes to verify if Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations for maximum service temperature ensure the safe use of such materials. Tensile tests were performed at the maximum service temperature on aged samples in two material directions to evaluate the progression of stiffness and Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) degradation. Aging induced damage was observed with the help of microscopic observations on the edges and cross-sections of tensile samples prior to loading. It was found that aging had a significant effect on UTS. It was also observed that the rate of deterioration was different for samples cut along different material directions, pointing towards anisotropic degradation mechanisms promoted by the braiding architecture. The investigated material had performances similar to existing high temperature composites, albeit at a lower temperature. It would therefore seem that FAA rules for setting the operating temperature are suitable for this material when aging effects are taken into consideration at the design stages."

The correctness of this algorithm is proved via the multivariable Faa di Bruno formula. Several examples with different types of nonlinearities are solved to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm."

Raw OP as preconcentrating sorbent was found to have low permeability towards the passed water samples and thus long time was needed. Even reducing the vacuum pressure caused cartridge blockage. Novel preconcentrating sorbents of high permeability were then prepared by heat pretreatment under inert atmosphere (partial pyrolysis) of OP at various temperatures (100, 150, 200, 250 and 300°C). The permeability of OP pyrolyzed at 200°C (sorbent OP-200) was enhanced 11 times relative to the raw OP, which significantly reduced the time required in the preconcentration process. A preconcentration procedure was optimized using OP-200 as preconcentrating sorbent, in which the detection limits were 42ngL−1 for Cu2+, 76ngL−1 for Zn2+ and 172ngmL−1 for Cd2+. The method was linear within the studied concentration range (2–100ngmL−1). The proposed method gave recoveries from 83±6 to 103±5% for determination of metals in tap water; and recoveries from 81±6 to 100±6% in well water.

To effectively improve their performance there is a critical need for an accurate analysis of both Big Data workloads and frameworks. This means to fully understand how the system resources are being used in order to identify potential bottlenecks, from resource to code bottlenecks. This paper presents BDWatchdog, a novel framework that allows real-time and scalable analysis of Big Data applications by combining time series for resource monitorization and flame graphs for code profiling, focusing on the processes that make up the workload rather than the underlying instances on which they are executed. This shift from the traditional system-based monitorization to a process-based analysis is interesting for new paradigms such as software containers or serverless computing, where the focus is put on applications and not on instances. BDWatchdog has been evaluated on a Big Data cloud-based service deployed at the CESGA supercomputing center. The experimental results show that a process-based analysis allows for a more effective visualization and overall improves the understanding of Big Data workloads. BDWatchdog is publicly available at http://bdwatchdog.dec.udc.es."

Partial least square regression (PLSR) was performed to analyze the correlation among data of quantitative sensory descriptive analysis, peptides, GC–MS and free amino acid (FAA) data of PXCs and PXs. Results revealed that MRPs formed at 120°C with cysteine addition (PXC-120) had greater meat-like flavor, mouthfulness and continuity taste compared to other MRPs. Molecular weight distribution showed that the presence of cysteine inhibited the low molecular weight (LMW) peptide cross-linking but accelerated the high molecular weight (HMW) peptide degradation with increasing temperature. Furthermore, results showed that the peptide above 5kDa has a significant negative contribution to sensory attributes of PXCs, while the peptide between 1 and 5kDa showed no significant but positive influence on PX sensory attributes. Sulfur containing compounds showed a significant and positive correlation to sensory attributes of PXCs while nitrogen containing compounds and furan were significantly but negatively correlated to sensory attributes of PXCs."

The average concentration values of the metals Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn were found to be 5±1, 52±18, 23±6, 104±29 and 116±35 mg kg-1 respectively, which were generally lower than the values cited in literature. The inter-elemental correlation of Cu and Pb indicated that they belonged to common anthropogenic sources. The pollution level was estimated based on the geoaccumulation index (Igeo), the pollution index (PI), and the integrated pollution index (IPI). The values of IPI were in the following order: Cu>Pb>Zn>Cd>Ni. All the indices for the metals under consideration were either low or corresponded to middle level of pollution. The pollution level is expected to increase due to rapid urbanization of the area. Some protective measures have therefore been proposed."

The potential non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks due to consumption of Scarus ghobban fillet were assessed by estimating average target hazard quotient (THQ) and total target hazard quotient (TTHQ) and Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk cancer risk (ILCR) of the analyzed metals. This study indicated that Cd, Pb, As and Hg concentrations were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and national standard limits. The meal concentrations (μg/kg dry weight) in both fillet and gill were ranked as follows Pb > Cd > As > Hg. THQ and TTHQ were lower than 1 for adults and children, indicating that consumers were not at considerable non-carcinogenic risk. However, ILCR value for As was greater than 10−4, indicating that consumers are at carcinogenic risk. Overall, this research highlighted that although the consumption of parrotfish from the Persian Gulf does not pose non-carcinogenic health risks, carcinogenic risks derived from toxic As can be detrimental for local consumers."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of FAA on the proliferation, migration and invasion of H1299 human lung cancer cells. Our results showed a strong antioxidant potential of FAA. Additionally, FAA inhibited the migration and invasion ability, while causing a significant accumulation of G2/M-population, of H1299 tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas no significant change on cell proliferation was observed. Results from the wound healing assay revealed that cell migration ability was markedly inhibited by FAA treatments. Similarly, results of gelatin zymography study showed that FAA treatments significantly decreased the activities of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, suggesting that FAA-mediated inhibition on migration and invasion of lung cancer cells may be achieved by the down-regulation of the MMPs activities. Taken together, our present work provides a new insight into the novel inhibitory function of FAA on cell migration in H1299 cells, suggesting its promising role in the chemoprevention of lung cancer."

Secondly, the decreased mRNA levels of Tdh, Eno and Pgk1 in glycolysis in faa mutant YB526 were confirmed by the differential protein analysis. As described in previous reports, the decreased protein levels of Tdh, Eno and Pgk1 were resulted from the increase of 14-3-3 protein activity. However, the increased level of 14-3-3 proteins could not improve the biosynthesis of ergosterol in the acyl-CoA deficiency strain YB526 due to the toxic effects of fatty acids.

This chapter takes the regulatory perspective from the view of the Voluntary Safety Programs Branch at FAA Headquarters. As a policy office, the Voluntary Safety Programs Branch sponsors Crew Resource Management (CRM) research, meets annually with all of the researchers, reviews airline training and checking scenarios, fields questions from airline and FAA field personnel, and reviews CRM assessment strategies of all air carriers subject to the policies of the branch. The branch's programs provide a major source of CRM data to the airlines and the FAA. This chapter addresses the role of the FAA in the history of the development of CRM as falling into three broad categories—the enforcement of minimal regulatory requirements, the encouragement of practices that exceed the regulatory minimums, and the funding of research programs that in part allow the FAA to determine where to draw the line between what will be strictly mandated and what will be simply encouraged. The power of the FAA's decision to support both voluntary and regulatory programs allows innovation to flourish. The prescriptive regulatory programs establish minimal standards for all to meet, while the voluntary programs allow each air carrier to exceed those standards in a manner that reflects that carrier's own unique safety culture."

The effect of parameters influencing the extraction efficiency, i.e. pH of the sample solutions, amount of the Schiff base, type and volume of stripping reagent, sample and eluent flow rates were evaluated. Under optimum experimental conditions, the capacity of the membrane disks modified by 4mg of the ligand was found to be 247.7 (±2.1)μg of copper. The detection limit and the concentration factor of the presented method are 2.4ng/l and greater than 400, respectively. The method was applied to the extraction, recovery and detection of copper in different synthetic and water samples."

The two predominant approaches being the time correlation analysis (that make use of a coincidence gate) methods of multiplicity shift register logic and Feynman sampling. The common feature is that the correlated nature of the pulse train can be described by a vector of reduced factorial multiplet rates. We call these singlets, doublets, triplets etc. Within the point reactor model the multiplet rates may be related to the properties of the item, the parameters of the detector, and basic nuclear data constants by a series of coupled algebraic equations – the so called point model equations. Solving, or inverting, the point model equations using experimental calibration model parameters is how assays of unknown items is performed. Currently only the first three multiplets are routinely used. In this work we develop the point model equations to higher order multiplets using the probability generating functions approach combined with the general derivative chain rule, the so called Faà di Bruno Formula. Explicit expression up to 5th order are provided, as well the general iterative formula to calculate any order. This work represents the first necessary step towards determining if higher order multiplets can add value to nondestructive measurement practice for nuclear materials control and accountancy."

In this study phenazone, propyphenazone, AAA and FAA were treated with ozone under laboratory conditions and 17 degradation products were identified by an elucidation approach based on high-resolution mass spectrometry (LTQ Orbitrap). Typical oxidation of carbon–carbon double bonds by ozone was observed among other mechanisms of ring opening. It was demonstrated that reactivity of these compounds with ozone is high (rate constants kO3 ranging from 6.5×104 to 2.4×106M−1s−1). The toxicity of the degradation products from ozonation was estimated by quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR). It was shown that, when the carbon–carbon double bond is partially oxidized to an epoxy, the toxicity towards fish and daphnids is higher than that of the parent compound. By further oxidizing the molecules, a common degradation product – 1-acetyl-1-methyl-2-phenylhydrazide (AMPH) – was also found to be more toxic than its parent compounds, which is of concern since this compound has previously been reported in environmental waters."

Greater relative right- than left-frontal cortical activity has been frequently found in adults with major depression (MD). As the few studies in adolescents with MD have been inconclusive, the aim of this study was to assess frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) in an adolescent sample with MD whilst taking into account possible confounding variables such as disease state and comorbid anxiety disorder.
Methods
An 8-minute resting frontal EEG was assessed in 34 healthy controls (HCs), 16 adolescents with MD in remission without comorbid anxiety disorder (rMDa−), 22 adolescents with acute depression without comorbid anxiety disorder (MDa−), and 23 adolescents with acute depression and comorbid anxiety disorder (MDa+). Alpha power was analyzed over corresponding frontal Regions of Interests.
Results
Compared to HCs, MDa+ adolescents demonstrated more left- than right-sided EEG alpha power, indicating greater right-than left-frontal cortical activity. No other group differences emerged.
Conclusions
The results suggest that greater relative right-frontal cortical activity in adolescent MD is not a result of disease state but can be attributed to comorbid anxiety disorder.
Significance
Results suggest that FAA is not linked to adolescent depression per se and highlight the importance of considering comorbid disorders when examining asymmetry patterns in adolescent MD."

In this study, chromate-reducing yeasts could be isolated from a textile-dye effluent and associated biofilm by using microcosm methodology with periodical 1 mM Cr(VI)-pulses. Viable cell count seemed to reveal a progressive tolerance increase to Cr(VI). However, fungal colony numbers decreased after 108 h of cultivation most likely as a consequence of the accumulated toxic effects of metal during enrichment. From 49 different Cr(VI)-tolerant fungal morphotypes isolated under selective conditions, 12 yeasts showed resistance up to 50 mM and 6 filamentous fungi up to 2 mM. These highly tolerant yeasts could be subsequently grouped into 8 OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) according to the ITS1-NL4 RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) analysis. From them, microsatellite amplification, sequencing and Cr(VI)-removal ability allowed to select two representative isolates. A polyphasic approach including morphological, physiological/biochemical characterization and molecular taxonomy analysis allowed to identify these isolates as Cyberlindnera jadinii M9 (previously Pichia jadinii) and Wickerhamomyces anomalus M10 (previously Pichia anomala). Cy. jadinii M9 and W. anomalus M10 were grown in YNB' medium plus 1 mM Cr(VI) at 25 °C and pH 5.0, causing complete chromium removal before reaching 48 h of cultivation. Flame Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (FAAS) assays suggested that Cr(VI) withdrawal was coupled to Cr(III) appearance. Electron microscopy studies indicated absence of precipitates on the cell wall region or microprecipitates into the cellular cytoplasm. These complementary results revealed that biospeciation to Cr(III) would the main detoxification mechanism in selected chromate-resistant yeasts, which could be thus envisaged as promising tools for future biological treatment of Cr(VI) pollution."

Material y métodos
Estudio prospectivo de pacientes pediátricos diagnosticados de FAA durante el período de abril a junio de 2006. Se determina la infección por M. pneumoniae por reacción en cadena de la polimerasa (PCR) con hibridación en medio líquido en una muestra de exudado faríngeo en estos pacientes y en el grupo control.
Resultados
Se incluyen 182 casos y 60 controles. La PCR es positiva en 7 de los casos (3,8%, intervalo de confianza del 95%: 1,5 a 7,7) y en ningún paciente del grupo control.
Conclusiones
La incidencia de la FAA por M. pneumoniae es baja en España. En niños sanos todas las PCR a M. pneumoniae son negativas, por lo que ante una FAA con PCR positiva debe valorarse su posible significado patológico.
Introduction
The aim of this study is to determine the role of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in pediatric patients with acute pharyngitis and in a healthy control group.
Methods
Prospective study conducted April and June 2006 of children with acute pharyngitis. M. pneumoniae infection was determined by PCR in pharyngeal exudate specimens from these patients and a healthy control group.
Results
A total of 182 cases and 60 controls were enrolled. PCR for M. pneumoniae was positive in 7 cases (3.8%, 95% CI 1.5–7.7) and negative in all controls.
Conclusions
The incidence of acute pharyngitis due to M. pneumoniae is low in our setting. In healthy patients (control group) all M. pneumoniae testing by PCR was negative; therefore, the possible pathological significance of all cases of acute pharyngitis PCR-positive for M. pneumoniae should be evaluated."

The main absorption lines for the analytes (Cu, Zn and Pb) and the possible ISs (Ag, Co, Ni and Bi) were chosen to perform the analysis. In addition, the possibility of introducing the sample in the spectrometer in a continuous or discontinuous mode was investigated. The limits of quantification (LOQs) obtained using Ag as IS and the continuous sample introduction mode were 0.040 mg L−1 for Zn, 0.016 mg L−1 for Cu, and 0.099 mg L−1 for Pb. In addition, the precision, expressed as the relative standard deviation (RSD), was lower than 4% for the three elements. The developed IS method was applied to analyse different commercial beverages: an apple juice, a ready-to-drink beverage containing fruit juices, an isotonic drink, a lemon and lime flavoured soft drink, a beer, a wine, a gin, a whisky, a rum, and an apple liqueur. For comparison, these beverages were also analysed using a conventional external calibration procedure. The Cu concentration was lower than 1.28 mg L−1 and 0.15 mg L−1 in alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, respectively, and Zn concentration was lower than 0.37 mg L−1 in alcoholic and 12.3 mg L−1 in non-alcoholic drinks.

Capitalizing on sub-2μm particles, this newly established UV-UPLC™ technique facilitated efficient chromatographic separation of 21 amino acid derivatives within 12min. In addition, UPLC™ demonstrated significant improvements due to superior performance and reduced run times compared with the former 35min of the original HPLC protocol. Using UV instead of fluorescence detection, amino acid quantification after pre-column derivatization with 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate (AQC) yielded appropriate sensitivities within the low pmol range with corresponding detection limits varying from 0.11 to 0.57pmol per injection. Moreover, the UPLC™ method was applied to characterize changes in the free (FAA) as well as total amino acid (TAA) profiles specific to culture media at three distinctive stages of fermentation: fresh medium, fermentation broth after cell mass production prior to induction and after product expression at the end of fermentation. Amino acid profiles intrinsic to the fresh, sterilized medium indicated free, hence more bioavailable, amino acids at a FAA/TAA ratio of 40%, whereas ongoing fermentation implied a rather specific, successive decline in selective FAA concentrations. Thereby, the most distinctive variations in FAAs were highlighted by aspartic acid, serine and threonine, each exhibiting an almost complete uptake from the culture media (−96% to −99%), with remaining FAA/TAA ratios of 1%, 8%, and 1%, respectively. This indeed may indicate limitations and shortages within the nutrient broth. Thus, amino acid monitoring utilizing high-throughput chromatography, such as UPLC™, can be considered as a valuable tool to facilitate rapid adjustments of fermentation broths and to optimize culture media to specific requirements."

On basis of the AccQ.Tag™ method as a commercialized amino acid analysis solution for HPLC, a new protocol for dedicated amino acid analysis using 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate (AQC) for pre-column derivatization was established by method transfer onto UPLC™ conditions. Since AQC derivatives enable both fluorescence (AccQ.Tag™ method) and UV detection, the performed method transfer additionally included changing to a more versatile UV detection. Emphasizing enhanced performance of UPLC™, the newly established protocol facilitated rapid and reliable separations of 24 amino acids within 23min, hence proved to be superior compared to the original HPLC protocol due to significant improvements in resolution and reduced runtime. Applying UV detection enabled adequate quantifications of AQC amino acid derivatives at μM level (LOQs from 0.12 to 1.10μM), thus proved sufficient sensitivity for amino acid profiling in wine samples. Moreover, this compiled methodology was successfully applied to monitor the changes of FAA concentrations in four distinct sets of on-lees aged white wines (fermented with different yeasts) at three progressing ripening periods, each (control, 3 and 6 months aging). For the control wines, the applied winery yeast significantly affected total FAA amounts (1450–1740mgL−1). During maturation, the proceeding yeast autolysis implied a rather complex impact on FAAs, yielding total FAA excretions up to 360mgL−1. However, the magnitude for increases of specific FAAs (up to +200%) highly depended on the individual amino acids as well as on the applied fermenting yeast. Given the overall complexity of yeast autolysis in winemaking, the application of efficient LC techniques such as UPLC™ may indeed contribute as a valuable tool in wine research for product monitoring and characterization of intrinsic developments during wine maturation."

Samples of A and B followed a repeatable pattern in 2008 and 2010. According to the results from 2008, samples of C contained measurable concentration of the following metals (mg/kg dry matter): Zn (21), Ni (1.05) and Ba (14.9). Several types of sludge samples were analyzed: fresh raw sludge (PS; 6–12hour old), the sludge from the digester for anaerobic sludge treatment (DS; 48–72hour old), samples from lagoons where the sludge is temporarily deposited (DOS and DOSold; 30–120days) and sludge samples from agricultural areas (AA; aged over 180days). Additionally, samples of dehydrated sludge (DEHS and DEHSold; 90–180days) were collected upon construction of equipment for sludge dehydration in 2011. An analysis of total metal concentrations for Cu, Zn, Cr, Pb, Ni, Hg, Cd, Ba, As, Se, Sb, Co, Mo, Fe and Mn was performed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The most recent results (year 2011) indicated a high concentration of heavy metals in PS samples, exceeding the MCLs (mg/kg dry matter): Cu (2122), Zn (5945), Hg (13.67) and Cd (6.29). In 2012 (until July), only a concentration of Cu exceeded MCL (928.75 and 1230.5 in DS and DEHS, respectively).

abstract = "This study was performed to develop a sensitive analytical method for the determination of cadmium by slotted quartz tube-flame atomic absorption spectrometry (SQT-FAAS) after dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME). The parameters affecting the cadmium complex formation and its extraction output were optimized to obtain high extraction efficiency. These included the pH and amount of the buffer solution, and the concentration of the ligand. The DLLME method was comprehensively optimized based on the type and amount of extraction solvent, dispersive solvent and salt. The type and period of mixing needed for a more effective extraction was also investigated. In order to further improve the sensitivity for the determination of cadmium, the flame atomic absorption spectrometry was fitted with a slotted quartz tube to increase the residence time of cadmium atoms in the pathway of incident light from a hollow cathode lamp. The limits of detection and quantitation (LOD and LOQ) for the FAAS were found to be 42 and 140μgL−1, respectively. Under the optimum conditions, LOD and LOQ of the FAAS after DLLME were calculated as 1.3 and 4.4μgL−1, respectively. Combining both optimized parameters of the DLLME and SQT-FAAS gave 0.5 and 1.5μgL−1 as LOD and LOQ, respectively. Accuracy of the method was also checked using a wastewater certified reference material (EU-L-2), and the result was in good agreement with the certified value."

abstract = "The aim of this project was to identify measurable physiological responses linked to the human experience of distress in a non-communicative state. Since sleep is a state of sensory-motor detachment in which subjects cannot report how they feel or what they experience, it can be considered a suitable model of non communicative states. A transitory distress-related response has consistently been reported in healthy awake subjects in the form of power spectrum alpha band changes in frontal brain areas. Hence, changes in frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) were analysed in 16 volunteers before and after administration of distressful aversive stimuli during sleep. Transient physical or emotional distress was achieved by presentation of conditioned (to electroshocks or affective images) or directly-applied aversive stimuli (electroshocks). Frontal beta asymmetry (FBA) was also evaluated for comparisons. Power spectrum data were assessed from frontal electroencephalographic (EEG) leads (F3/F4). Galvanic skin response (GSR) and heart rate (HR) were also simultaneously monitored. To test the possibility that the short lasting stimulations would have long-term physiological effects, we included saliva cortisol sampling, evaluation of dream emotional valence and a standard assessment of sleep quality measurements. Aversive stimulation of diverse nature, compared to neutral valence stimuli, produced measurable changes in FAA (left>right) and in GSR evoked responses in both stage 2 (S2) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep suggesting implicit processing of experiences with negative valence. Noticeably, dream content evaluation showed a trend towards increased negative emotionality. No FBA was observed, confirming the specificity of FAA responses. Saliva cortisol, and sleep parameters were not significantly affected by the protocol. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that an aversive imaging conditioning protocol has been successfully applied during sleep."

The proposed method has been successfully used for speciation analysis (qualitative and quantitative) of inorganic aluminium forms AlFn(3−n)+ in soil samples. In order to isolate the most environmentally available fraction, 5g of the sample was collected and extracted in deionised water (water soluble fraction) for 1h using a magnetic stirrer. The determinations in a hyphenated technique system were performed for a number of prepared water extracts. Concentration determinations of particular aluminium forms were performed based on model studies and real samples. The separation of Al species with nominal charge of +1, +2, and +3 required a run time of less than 4min during a single analysis. Based on the analysis of water extracts of soil, it was obtained that aluminium forms elute in the following order: 1PA (first signal) — AlF2+ and/or AlF4−; 2PA (second signal) — AlF2+ and/or AlF30; 3PA (third signal) — Al3+. In order to confirm the occurrence of these forms a simulation using the Mineql program was conducted. The details of speciation analysis of aluminium fluoride forms by means of an HPIC-FAAS instrument equipped are presented.

abstract = "Many industry observers foresee that agriculture worldwide is posed to substantially benefit from the use of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), commonly known as drones. Industry special interests predict that 80% of domestic sales of UASs in the U.S. will be for agriculture. However, some fear that the public anxiety of the UAS operating in U.S. airspace could stall their introduction, a move that would potentially place some of American farmers’ production practices at an economic disadvantage. Currently, this public policy controversy is influencing UAS integration into U.S. agriculture, with the potential of spilling over internationally. This project examines the nature of the current debate surrounding the UAS within the U.S., analyzes the impact on agriculture from the legislation considered, discusses policy options to ameliorate the controversy, and describes the factors that will likely determine UAS operations within the U.S. The information was obtained from government documents, academic research, industry studies, nonprofit organizations, and media reports. An analysis was done using these data on how UAS legislation may affect agriculture. Popularized images of the silent-kills overseas using militarized UASs, safety concerns, and a fear of privacy invasions were found to generate intense opposition to their domestic integration. Spurred by the FAA’s congressional mandate to fully integrate UASs into the nation’s airspace, a significant number of bills, particularly in state legislatures, have been introduced in an attempt to regulate UAS use. Although geared toward privacy protection and law enforcement, some laws may adversely affect agriculture because they create legal uncertainty and/or they sweepingly ban or highly curtail local UAS operations. Possible solutions have been proposed: (1) reducing the legal uncertainty regarding UASs, (2) adopting an industry Code of Conduct and Safe Practices, and (3) producing a consensus on UAS regulations among diverse groups through an open discussion of how to balance UAS operations with safeguards on privacy and property rights. The perceived economic potential of the UAS, particularly in agriculture, combined with the lobbying power of the UAS industry, strongly suggest that policy will eventually be developed that will allow the use of this technology for agriculture in U.S. airspace."

Unrealistic expectations, or hype, produce consumer excitement and then disenchantment with the technology before its acceptance. Using the Garter Hype Cycle as a framework, this study examines expectations regarding domestic applications of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in agriculture. A content analysis of 5418 U.S. media reports from 2010 through 2014 shows hype was used in describing potential UAV applications in farming. Media reports were highly speculative and overly optimistic, and in the near term largely unrealistic. The agricultural UAV hype appears to be a response to hostility toward government domestic surveillance use of UAVs. As public hostility toward police use of UAVs increased, media reports shifted away from government deployment to the economic development created by relatively noncontroversial commercial applications. Hype has both potential benefits and costs for those seeking expansion of a technology. The hype was arguably necessary to allay negative public opinion and a hostile political environment toward domestic expansion of the UAV. The negative ramification of hype is that a period of disillusionment follows the inevitable realization that expectations for the technology were unrealistic. Market expansion is stalled or even derailed. According to the Garter Hype Cycle, there will be a period of disillusionment regarding the contributions of UAVs to agriculture once there is the legalization of commercial applications in the U.S. However, UAV deployment on farms should increase after realistic expectations regarding near-term contributions are developed and disseminated."

UAV advocates used various methods to counter UAV's negative image. This study examines media stories regarding UAVs over a four-year period (2011–2014) and demonstrates that despite the backlash against expansion, media frames emphasizing benefit rather than risk dominated in the U.S. media. The economic opportunities presented by UAVs appeared in most media reports and over time reports increased of relatively noncontroversial applications, such as agriculture. Citizen advocacy or frames that emphasized the personal freedom to fly a UAV also increased. Industry and university officials, who usually support expansion, were the most frequent sponsors of media statements. The framing of media reports can influence public debate. Potential risks of a new technology can be amplified or minimized depending on how the media present the issue to the public."

Fifteen subjects were presented an auditory syllable consisting of either “fee [fi:],” “faa [fα:],” “hee [hi:],” or “haa [hα:],” and were instructed to overtly repeat each given syllable. Gamma-oscillations in the superior temporal gyrus were highly augmented during syllable-presentation, least augmented at the onset of syllable-articulation, and again highly augmented following syllable-articulation. Gamma-oscillations were augmented in the inferior Rolandic area prior to and during syllable-articulation with the onset and peak occurring earlier in the left side. Subsets of the inferior Rolandic sites, more frequently on the left side, showed differential gamma-augmentation elicited by articulation of phoneme [f] more than [h] or phoneme [i:] more than [α:]. Our observations suggest that the superior temporal gyrus may be active when externally presented or articulated auditory stimuli are present, and may be minimally active when articulation is about to be initiated. Our novel observation of phoneme-specific differential gamma-augmentation in the inferior Rolandic area may be partially attributed to the mouth position during phoneme-articulation. Our observations support the hypothesis that positioning of the mouth to articulate phonemes is predominantly driven and/or monitored by the primary sensorimotor area on the left side."

A decomposition space is a simplicial ∞-groupoid satisfying an exactness condition weaker than the Segal condition. Just as the Segal condition expresses composition, the new condition expresses decomposition. In this paper, we introduce various technical conditions on decomposition spaces. The first is a completeness condition (weaker than Rezk completeness), needed to control simplicial nondegeneracy. For complete decomposition spaces we establish a general Möbius inversion principle, expressed as an explicit equivalence of ∞-groupoids. Next we analyse two finiteness conditions on decomposition spaces. The first, that of locally finite length, guarantees the existence of the important length filtration for the associated incidence coalgebra. We show that a decomposition space of locally finite length is actually the left Kan extension of a semi-simplicial space. The second finiteness condition, local finiteness, ensures we can take homotopy cardinality to pass from the level of ∞-groupoids to the level of Q-vector spaces. These three conditions — completeness, locally finite length, and local finiteness — together define our notion of Möbius decomposition space, which extends Leroux's notion of Möbius category (in turn a common generalisation of the locally finite posets of Rota et al. and of the finite decomposition monoids of Cartier–Foata), but which also covers many coalgebra constructions which do not arise from Möbius categories, such as the Faà di Bruno and Connes–Kreimer bialgebras. Note: The notion of decomposition space was arrived at independently by Dyckerhoff and Kapranov [6] who call them unital 2-Segal spaces."

abstract = "Phyllosoma of the tropical spiny rock lobster, Panulirus ornatus, possess a rudimentary digestive system with a limited capacity to digest large protein molecules. As such, to foster the successful aquaculture of this species, research into dietary requirements should place a focus on feed ingredients aligned with digestive capacity. Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess the effects of two protein pre-digestion treatments: acid denaturation and enzyme hydrolysis, on a regular fishmeal ingredient in a novel formulated diet for early–mid stage P. ornatus phyllosoma (Stages III–VIII). Three iso-nitrogenous, iso-lipidic and iso-energetic diets were formulated with 100% of protein originating from intact fishmeal (IFM), acid-denatured fishmeal (DFM) or enzyme hydrolysed fishmeal (HFM) and fed to early–mid stage phyllosoma for a period of 35-days. Growth performance metrics were all significantly higher in phyllosoma receiving the HFM treatment compared to the DFM and IFM treatments. Phyllosoma fed the HFM diet also had the most advanced development stages, with a significantly greater proportion of individuals reaching Stage VII (2). No significant differences were detectable in either the protein-bound or FAA composition of phyllosoma across all treatments, suggesting that the superior growth performance of the HFM fed phyllosoma was the result of an increased abundance of intermediate, shorter chain dietary peptides. The present study suggests that enzyme hydrolysed fishmeal is a superior protein ingredient for artificial diets and most closely resembles the requisite dietary protein format for P. ornatus phyllosoma."

In this proposed procedure, Ni–DDTC complex instead of DDTC was used to achieve one-step extraction. Since the stability of Cu–DDTC and Ag–DDTC is higher than that of Ni–DDTC, simultaneous preconcentration of Cu and Ag can be achieved in a single step. Up to 15,000mgL−1 Co2+, 10,000mgL−1 Zn2+, 5000mgL−1 Cd2+ and 5000mgL−1 Al3+ did not cause significant interferences for the determination of 50μgL−1 Cu by FAAS, while 8000mgL−1 Zn2+, 4000mgL−1 Co2+, 4000mgL−1 Cd2+ and 5000mgL−1 Al3+ had no distinct effect on the determination of 80μgL−1 Ag. The limits of detection (LODs) of 0.5μgL−1 for Cu and 1.0μgL−1 for Ag, respectively, were obtained by FAAS detection. The accuracy of the proposed method is validated by analyzing certified reference materials (GBW 07405, GBW 07311 and GBW 07260) with satisfactory results. Furthermore, the one-step D-CPE was also applied for the preconcentration/separation of Cu and Ag in high-purity salts and artificial seawater, followed by FAAS or inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) determination."

The PEMER configuration comprised of an anode and cathode based on nanoparticulate Ni and Pt electrocatalysts, respectively, supported on carbonaceous substrates. The electrooxidation of PGA was performed in 1.0M NaOH, where a cathode based on a gas diffusion electrode was manufactured for the reduction of oxygen in alkaline conditions. The performance of a novel alkaline anion-exchange membrane based on Chitosan (CS) and Poly(vinyl) alcohol (PVA) in a 50:50 composition ratio doped with a 5wt.% of poly (4-vinylpyridine) organic ionomer cross-linked, methyl chloride quaternary salt resin (4VP) was assessed as solid polymer electrolyte. The influence of 4VP anionic ionomer loading of 7, 12 and 20wt.% incorporated into the electrocatalytic layers was examined by SEM and cyclic voltammetry (CV) upon the optimisation of the electroactive area, the mechanical stability and cohesion of the catalytic ink onto the carbonaceous substrate for both electrodes. The performance of the 4VP/CS:PVA membrane was compared with the commercial alkaline anion-exchange membrane FAA −a membrane generally used in direct alcohol alkaline fuel cells- in terms of polarisation plots in alkaline conditions. Furthermore, preparative electrolyses of the electrooxidation of PGA was performed under alkaline conditions of 1M NaOH at constant current density of 20mAcm−2 using a PEMER configuration to provide proof of the principle of the feasibility of the electrooxidation of other alcohols in alkaline media. PGA conversion to Z isomers of 3-(2-propynoxy)-2-propenoic acid (Z-PPA) was circa 0.77, with average current efficiency of 0.32. Alkaline stability of the membranes within the PEMER configuration was finally evaluated after the electrooxidation of PGA."

The structural properties, thermal stability, hydrolytic stability, transport and ionic properties of the prepared composite membranes were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), water uptake, water content, alcohol permeability, thickness, ion exchange capacity (IEC) and OH− conductivity measurements. The addition of both organic and inorganic fillers in a CS:PVA blend polymer enhances the thermal and ionic properties. All the membranes are homogenous, as revealed by the SEM and XRD studies, except when UZAR-S3 stannosilicate is used as filler, which leads to a dual layer structure, a top layer of UZAR-S3 lamellar particles bound together by the polymer matrix and a bottom layer composed mostly of polymer blend. The loss of crystallinity was especially remarkable in 4VP/CS:PVA membrane. Thus, the 4VP/CS:PVA membrane exhibits the best ionic conductivity, whereas the UZAR-S3/CS:PVA membrane the best reduced alcohol crossover. Finally, the performance of the CS:PVA-based membranes were tested in a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Electrochemical Reactor (PEMER) for the feasibility use of alkaline anionic exchange membranes in electrosynthesis under alkaline conditions, showing the 4VP/CS:PVA and UZAR-S3/CS:PVA membranes the best performances in PEMER."

L. reuteri reached counts above 7logcfu/g on day 1. Lactococci survival was enhanced in SLR cheese without affecting cheese pH, dry matter, proteolysis, concentration of most free amino acids (FAA), textural and most color parameters, or sensory characteristics. In situ production of reuterin by L. reuteri was only detected in SLR-G cheese, decreasing LAB counts although acidification remained unaffected. SLR-G cheese showed higher values of cell free aminopeptidase activity, overall proteolysis and FAA, particularly glutamic acid, than CTRL and SLR cheeses. The addition of L. reuteri-glycerol resulted in lower hardness and elasticity values in SLR-G cheese and influenced its L*, a* and b* color parameters. However, these changes, which were detected by instrumental analysis, did not affect the sensory scores for texture and color quality of SLR-G cheese, and it received the highest scores for taste quality. Our results suggest that L. reuteri-glycerol may provide a suitable system to release the antimicrobial reuterin in cheese without affecting negatively its sensory characteristics."

At UTC Aerospace Systems a test program was developed to assess the behaviour of alternative agents at values below inerting concentration. Two agents were selected, C2HF5 (Pentafluoroethane, HFC-125) and C6F12O (FK-5-1-12, Novec™1230). Baseline tests were performed with unsuppressed C3H8 (propane)/air mixtures and C3H8/air mixtures with CF3Br (Halon 1301) and N2 (nitrogen). Using CF3Br or N2 at below inerting concentrations mitigated the explosion. C2HF5 was tested against C3H8 at stoichiometric (4 vol%) and lower explosion limit (LEL) (2 vol%). Against 4 vol% C3H8 the combustion was mitigated, proportional to agent concentration; however, low concentrations of C2HF5 with 2 vol% C3H8 enhanced the explosion. Tests with N2 against a volatile mixture of C3H8 with C2HF5 showed that N2 mitigated the events. Final tests were performed with low concentrations of C6F12O against C3H8/air mixtures. This showed similar behaviour to that observed with the C2HF5 tests. Normally during qualification tests for new agents the stoichiometric concentration of a fuel is deemed to be the worst case scenario and the baseline against which agents are tested. The above described test results show that this assumption may need to be reconsidered. This work shows that contrary to common assumption the agents investigated are unlikely to have acted chemically at the flame front, but most likely, mainly cooled the flame and changed the stoichiometry, i.e. the ratio of components of the flammable mixture."

This study was conducted to investigate whether metabolic response to mildly elevated water temperature (MEWT) relates to species-dependent muscular concentrations of imidazoles and FAA. Thirteen carp and 17 Nile tilapia, housed one per aquarium, were randomly assigned to either acclimation (25°C) or MEWT (30°C) for 14 days. Main muscular concentrations were histidine (HIS; P<0.001) in carp versus N-α-acetylhistidine (NAH; P<0.001) and taurine (TAU; P=0.001) in tilapia. Although the sum of imidazole (HIS+NAH) and TAU in muscle remained constant over species and temperatures (P>0.05), (NAH+HIS)/TAU ratio was markedly higher in carp versus tilapia, and decreased with MEWT only in carp (P<0.05). Many of the muscular FAA concentrations were higher in carp than in tilapia (P<0.05). Plasma acylcarnitine profile suggested a higher use of AA and fatty acids in carp metabolism (P<0.05). On the contrary, the concentration of 3-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine, a sink of leucine catabolism, (P=0.009) pointed to avoidance of leucine use in tilapia metabolism. Despite a further increase of plasma longer-chain acylcarnitines in tilapia at MEWT (P=0.009), their corresponding beta-oxidation products (3-hydroxy-longer-chain acylcarnitines) remained constant. Together with higher plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in carp (P=0.001), the latter shows that carp, being a fatter fish, more readily mobilises fat than tilapia at MEWT, which coincides with more intensive muscular mobilization of imidazoles. This study demonstrates that fish species differ in their metabolic response to MEWT, which is associated with species-dependent changes in muscle imidazole to taurine ratio."

The involvement of endogenous protease(s) in the generation of Free Amino Acids (FAAs) participating in the Maillard reaction was characterized. The browning and myosin heavy chain degradation during air-drying were obviously mitigated by the addition of metalloprotease inhibitors, especially EGTA and 1,10-phenanthroline, followed by serine proteinase inhibitor, especially PMSF. The amount of total FAAs in dried products increased by only 0.17% with the addition of 1,10-phenanthroline and 5.0% with added EGTA. In autolysis models, protein autolysis was almost completely inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline. The addition of, 1,10-phenanthroline inhibited the increase in total FAAs including arginine (Arg), followed by EGTA and PMSF. The results indicated that endogenous metalloproteases and serine proteases might influence the generation of FAAs including Arg, and contribute to product discoloration during air-drying."

Methanol acidified with 1molL−1 HNO3 was added to the surfactant-rich phase prior to its analysis by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The concentration of BIES, pH and amount of surfactant (Triton X-114) was optimized. At optimum conditions, the detection limits of (3sdb/m) of 1.4, 2.8, 1.6 and 1.4ngmL−1 for Cd2+, Pb2+, Pd2+ and Ag+ along with preconcentration factors of 30 and enrichment factors of 48, 39, 32 and 42 for Cd2+, Pb2+, Pd2+ and Ag+, respectively, were obtained.

During the microextraction process, 1-phenyl-1,2-propanedione-2-oximethiosemicarbazone (PPDOT) was used as a proper chelating agent to form hydrophobic complex compounds, causing easy and effective penetration of metal ions into the organic extraction phase. On the other hand, by providing proper pH values via addition of an efficacious effervescent agent, the extraction medium could acquire a dual hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity nature, leading to a simple and efficient proceeding of the foresaid microextraction, followed by a quick and no labor intensive collection of the organic solvent (upper phase) in a special home-made extraction cell. Also simple, rapid, accurate, efficient, and inexpensive analyses via the MS-FAAS technique distinguished the determination of the foresaid metal ions. Under other optimum conditions enriched via the central composite design, the studied ions could be accurately determined in the wide linear dynamic ranges of 5.0–150ngmL−1 and 8.0–200ngmL−1 for the Ag+ and Co2+ ions, respectively, with the determination coefficients (R2s) higher than 0.98. The low limits of detection and the good percentage relative standard deviations were found to be in the span of 2.0–3.0ngmL−1 and 3.4–4.2%, respectively. The percentage extraction recoveries and the enrichment factors were found to be reasonably quantitative. These valuable results indicated the high quality of the developed procedure for the influential quantification of the aforementioned metal ions from cow milk, vitamin B12, orange juice, and tap water."

We have reconstructed a sequence of vegetation dynamics and fire changes across south-eastern Iberia by coupling records of climate, fire, vegetation and human activities. We calculated fire activity anomalies (FAAs) in relation to 3kacalBP for 10–8kacalBP, 6kacalBP, 4kacalBP and the present. For most of the Early to the Mid-Holocene uneven, but low fire events were the main vegetation driver at high altitudes where broadleaved and coniferous trees presented a highly dynamic post-fire response. At mid-altitudes in the mainland Segura Mountains, fire activity remained relatively stable, at similar levels to recent times. We hypothesize that coastal areas, both mountains and lowlands, were more fire-prone landscapes as biomass was more likely to have accumulated than in the inland regions, triggering regular fire events. The wet and warm phase towards the Mid-Holocene (between ca 8 and 6kacalBP) affected the whole region and promoted the spread of mesophytic forest co-existing with Pinus, as FAAs appear strongly negative at 6kacalBP, with a less important role of fire. Mid and Late Holocene landscapes were shaped by an increasing aridity trend and the rise of human occupation, especially in the coastal mountains where forest disappeared from ca 2kacalBP. Mediterranean-type vegetation (evergreen oaks and Pinus pinaster-halepensis types) showed the fastest post-fire vegetation dynamics over time."

In recent years, serverless computing and, in particular, Functions as a Service (FaaS) has surged as an execution model in which no explicit management of servers (e.g. virtual machines) is performed by the user. Instead, the Cloud provider dynamically allocates resources to the function invocations and fine-grained billing is introduced depending on the execution time and allocated memory, as exemplified by AWS Lambda. In this article, a high-performant serverless architecture has been created to execute MapReduce jobs on AWS Lambda using Amazon S3 as the storage backend. In addition, a thorough assessment has been carried out to study the suitability of AWS Lambda as a platform for the execution of High Throughput Computing jobs. The results indicate that AWS Lambda provides a convenient computing platform for general-purpose applications that fit within the constraints of the service (15 min of maximum execution time, 3008 MB of RAM and 512 MB of disk space) but it exhibits an inhomogeneous performance behaviour that may jeopardise adoption for tightly coupled computing jobs."

High element contents (in mgkg−1) of some food samples are highlighted. “Dried spices for local sauce” (raw/toasted) highly contained calcium (7720), iron (143), magnesium (1970), potassium (20,100), copper (12.6), manganese (109), aluminium (120), and lead (14.3). “Dried and smoked fish and shrimps” (boiled) contained high levels of calcium (21,200), potassium (7300), zinc (43.6), aluminium (27.8), and arsenic (1.14). “Garden huckleberry and amaranth” (boiled/washed fresh leaves) contained high levels of calcium (3580), manganese (15.9) and barium (19.4). “Squash beans and sesame” (boiled) provided magnesium (1240), and zinc (29.5). “Shelled groundnut” (soaked/grilled/boiled) contained high levels of magnesium (1040), zinc (31.5), and copper (8.32). Selenium was found only in fish as mackerel (0.467) and sea bass (0.450). No food product exceeded the maximum levels set for lead, mercury and cadmium by the current European regulation. These results will be used for dietary exposure and health risk assessment."

The trial consisted in substituting up to 75% (wt/wt) the enriched Artemia with the experimental microdiets from 15 to 40days post-hatch, whereas larvae were exclusively fed on microdiets from 40 to 55dph. Protein hydrolysates used in the present study were obtained from different raw materials (yeast, pig blood and fish protein concentrate) and differed in their amino acid (AA) profile and in their molecular weight distribution. YPH and PBPH were mainly composed by free amino acids (FAA) (44%, MW<200Da), di- and tripeptides (50%, 200<MW<500Da) and 6% of larger polypeptides (500<MW<2500Da); whereas the fish protein hydrolysate (FPH) did only contain a minor quantity of FAA (1.5%) and was mainly composed of di- and tripeptides (36.5%) and larger polypeptides (51.4%, 500<MW<2500Da). The contents in FAA and di- and tripeptides in the microdiet containing FPH were 0.2 and 4.4%, respectively. FAA levels in microdiets including YPH and PBPH at 9 and 12% were 4.0 and 5.3%, whereas levels of di- and tripeptides were 4.5 and 6.0%, respectively. Results revealed that FPH in microdiets for marine fish larvae may be replaced by alternative protein hydrolysates obtained from yeast and pig blood, as fish fed with those diets performed, in terms of growth, survival, level of maturation of the enterocytes (activity of cytosolic and brush border enzymes) and incidence of skeletal deformities, as well as those larvae fed with only enriched live preys (rotifers and Artemia). Using YPH and PBPH, the inclusion level of protein hydrolysate in microdiets might be reduced to 9% (3% lesser to actual practices using fish protein hydrolysates) without affecting larval performance. Present results suggested the importance of leucine, valine and phenylalanine in fish larval skeletogenesis and in the appearance of skeletal disorders."

The extraction method was evaluated using the spiking method with satisfactory results (recoveries>95% and RSDs<5%). The limit of detection (LOD) for Cr(VI) based on three times the standard deviations of the blank (for n=5) was 0.56µgg−1. Statistical evaluation indicated that the comparison of the sum of the concentrations of chromium species to that of the total concentration of chromium do not show any difference at 95% level of confidence. Besides, no statistically significant difference at 95% confidence level was observed between the UV–vis spectrophotometry and FAAS results for Cr(VI). However, it is observed that selective extraction of Cr(VI) using EPA 3060A and subsequent determination by FAAS is simple and faster compared to the other method. Furthermore, for comparison and as control two soil samples collected from a distance of about 2km from the main Industry and effluent stream. The results indicate that higher total chromium content was observed in soils collected from the target area. Nevertheless, the maximum concentrations of Cr(VI) found in soil samples collected around Sheba Leather Industry was 9.9µgg−1 and are within the acceptable level of 10µgg−1 in accordance with the WHO."

The conditions of Pd(II) separation on all polymers were optimized. The efficiencies of retention of Pd on different polymers in the presence of high excess of interfering ions were compared. The effect of the used porogen on the analytical performance of the prepared polymers was also investigated. The calculated sorbent capacities for Pd(II) were in the range from 9.25mgg−1 to 13.3mgg−1. The sorbent with Pd(II) imprinted as Pd–DMG–VP complex in chloroform was used for preconcentration of trace amounts of Pd.

Furthermore, the use of multiplets for Fe and the side pixel registration approach for Mg have been studied in order to reduce sensitivity and extend the linear working range. The figures of merit have been calculated and the proposed method was applied to determine these elements in a pine needles reference material (SRM 1575a), drinking and natural waters and soil extracts. Recoveries of analytes added at different concentration levels to water samples and extracts of soils were within 88–115% interval. In this way, the fast sequential multi-element determination of major and minor elements can be carried out, in triplicate, with successful results without requiring additional dilutions of samples or several different strategies for sample preparation using about 8–9mL of sample."

These resources are increasingly delivered by multiple converged infrastructures, e.g. clouds that combine server, storage, and network resources from different providers. Such development requires careful re-thinking of the trust framework used between providers. As the scale and complexity of virtualization grows, so does the complexity of authorizing resource chains that are arranged across multiple providers. This type of authorization requires pre-establishment of trust relationships between providers and arranging some level of power. This paper studies the roles of trust and power when considering the requirements of authorization protocol exchanges between providers. Establishing power in the form of impersonal rules is a key element to conduce the necessary trust between providers. The Service Provider Group (SPG) is a way to arrange such power. The SPG framework provides a way to organize thinking about multi-provider services and can be used to describe emerging collaborations such as those found within the realm of optical network service provisioning."

Aircraft maintenance operations of a complex and extended nature can only be performed at designated maintenance bases. Aircraft maintenance planning literature has focused on developing good tail-number routing plans, while assuming that the locations of the maintenance bases themselves are fixed. This paper considers an inverse optimization problem, viz., locating a minimal number of maintenance bases on an Euler tour, while ensuring that all required aircraft maintenance activities can be performed with a stipulated periodicity. The Aircraft Maintenance Base Location Problem (AMBLP) is shown to be NP-complete and a new lower bound is developed for the problem. The performance of four simple “quick and dirty” heuristics for obtaining feasible solutions to AMBLP is analyzed."

However, veterinarians and farmers often overlook that common feed components, such as proteins and calcium, may interact with these drugs and thereby alter their properties. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effect of crude protein and calcium on the bioavailability of 14 first-, second-, and third-generation tetracyclines, tetracycline epimers that may arise during storage, and other tetracycline derivatives in 84 feedstuffs for shrimp, swine, tilapia, and poultry marketed in Costa Rica. To this end, crude protein was quantified with a Kjeldahl method, calcium was determined by flame atomic spectroscopy (FAAS), and tetracyclines were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection (FLD) and with two different whole-cell biosensors to discriminate matrix-bound, inactive tetracyclines from free, active fractions. Tilapia feed contained the highest amounts of HPLC-detectable tetracyclines (119–8365mgkg−1). Poultry (78–438mgkg−1) and swine feed (41–1076mgkg−1) were characterized by intermediate concentrations, while shrimp feed showed the lowest amounts of these drugs (21–50mgkg−1). Ten samples contained unauthorized antibiotics, including doxycycline, and another three had 4-epimers of tetracyclines, indicating degradation during prolonged storage. Biological detection of tetracyclines was inversely related to both feed crude protein (r2=0.58–0.75) and calcium content (r2=0.54–0.63). Moreover, only 12–55% of the concentrations determined by HPLC were appraised by the biosensors. Shrimp feed, followed by tilapia feed, showed the highest crude protein (14.5–52.2g100g−1) and calcium (0.89–5.90mgkg−1) concentrations and, as predicted, the lowest bioavailable fractions of tetracyclines (12–40%). Finally, we provide equations that predict bioavailability as a function of crude protein, calcium, and tetracycline concentrations in feed. Our data reveals medication abnormalities in commercial feeds and provide novel biological information for several tetracyclines."

Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were reduced by the addition of curing salts but were low in all cases, suggesting high antioxidant stability in dry-cured ham which was corroborated by the low volatile aldehyde contents."

abstract = "A Faà di Bruno type Hopf algebra is developed for a group of integral operators known as Fliess operators, where operator composition is the group product. Such operators are normally written in terms of generating series over a noncommutative alphabet. Using a general series expansion for the antipode, an explicit formula for the generating series of the compositional inverse operator is derived. The result is applied to analytic nonlinear feedback systems to produce an explicit formula for the feedback product, that is, the generating series for the Fliess operator representation of the closed-loop system written in terms of the generating series of the Fliess operator component systems. This formula is employed to provide a proof that local convergence is preserved under feedback."

An explicit formula for the generating series of a single-input, single-output closed-loop system was provided by the first two authors in earlier work via Hopf algebra methods. This paper is a sequel. It has four main innovations. First, the full multivariable extension of the theory is presented. Next, a major simplification of the basic setup is introduced using a new type of grading that has recently appeared in the literature. This grading also facilitates a fully recursive algorithm to compute the antipode of the Hopf algebra of the output feedback group, and thus, the corresponding feedback product can be computed much more efficiently. The final innovation is an improved convergence analysis of the antipode operation, namely, the radius of convergence of the antipode is computed."

The composition of electrolyte solutions served as the liquid cathode was modified by the addition of non-ionic surfactants, namely Triton x-45, Triton x-100, Triton x-405 and Triton x-705. The effect of the concentration of each surfactant was thoroughly studied on the emission characteristic of molecular bands identified in spectra, atomic emission lines of 16 metals studied and the background level. It was found that the presence of both heavy surfactants results in a significant increase in the net intensity of analytical lines of metals and a notable reduction of the intensity of bands of diatomic molecules and the background. In conditions considered to be a compromise for all metals, selected figures of merit for this excitation source combined with the optical emission spectrometry detection were determined. Limits of detection for all metals were within the range of 0.0003–0.05mgL−1, the precision was better than 6%, while calibration curves were linear over 2 orders of the magnitude of the concentration or more, e.g., for K, Li, Mg, Na and Rb. The discharge system with the liquid cathode modified by the addition of the surfactant found its application in the determination of Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na and Zn in selected environmental samples, i.e., waters, soils and spruce needles, with the quite good precision and the accuracy comparable to that for measurements with flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) and flame atomic emission spectrometry (FAES)."

Eight grass silages with contents of FAA lower than 300mmol/kg dry matter (DM; GS-LOW) and eight grass silages with contents higher than 300mmol/kg DM (GS-HIGH) were tested in vitro for their effects on selected variables of nitrogen metabolism. Ammonia concentration, production of the branched-chain volatile fatty acids (BCVFA) isobutyric and isovaleric acid, concentration of FAA in fermenter fluid, and the content of bacterial protein in fermenter fluid were measured daily from days 1 to 28 (ammonia, BCVFA), 3 and 6 to 28 (bacterial protein), and days 7, 8, 11 to 13, 16 to 21, and 26 to 28 (FAA), respectively. Subsequent to an initial 9-day adaptation period during which hay (10.5g DM) and concentrate (3.0g DM) were added to fermenters, grass silages (10.5g DM) were individually incubated in the fermenters for a period of 10 days (experimental period). The experimental period was followed by the recovery period during which the additions of hay and concentrate were equal to those of the adaptation period. Addition of GS-HIGH increased the concentration of ammonia (P<0.05) and production of isobutyric (P<0.05) and isovaleric (P<0.05) acid in contrast to GS-LOW. The concentration of FAA, as well as the content of bacterial protein in fermenter fluid, showed no differences after addition of GS-LOW or GS-HIGH (P>0.05). The calculated efficiency of nitrogen fixation in bacterial protein was expressed as units of bacterial protein per g nitrogen input with the silages and was lower or tended to be lower, respectively, with GS-HIGH on 5 days of the experimental period (P<0.1). Increased concentration of ammonia and production of BCVFA indicate that amino acid catabolism was increased by additions of GS-HIGH compared to GS-LOW whereas efficiency of nitrogen fixation in bacterial protein seemed to be decreased. The observed effects may be due to higher metabolic activity of amino acid-fermenting bacteria."

Introduction
Hair loss is one of the most prevalent reasons for consultation in dermatology, with female androgenetic alopecia (FAA), acute telogen effluvium (ATE) and chronic telogen effluvium (CTE) being the most common causes in women.
Material and methods
A multicentre, open-label, uncontrolled study was conducted to determine the effectiveness and safety of combined therapy with two products formulated from mineral and nutritional supplements (capsules and spray) in 66 women diagnosed with FAA, ATE or CTE. Daily treatment with both products was indicated for four months. The patients were recruited between January 31, 2014 and July 17, 2014. The following variables were assessed: percentage of hairs in anagen phase and resistance to hair loss due to traction, cosmeticity and tolerability of the product in spray format, patient's personal assessment, overall satisfaction and quality of life. There was one baseline visit and two follow-up visits.
Results
Relative to baseline, there was an 8.9% and 9.9% increase in the percentage of hairs in anagen phase after 60 and 120 days of treatment, respectively, and a 20.1% and 22.4% reduction in the percentage of patients with hair loss after 60 and 120 days of treatment, respectively. The cosmeticity of the spray product was appropriate and the tolerability was good. Quality of life improved after the treatment and the patients showed positive overall satisfaction.
Conclusion
This study shows a positive therapeutic effect of the combination of the two products with a good safety and tolerability profile."

The results revealed the presence of high lead levels, well above the maximum limit allowed by the legislation. Pb contamination levels achieved after the following treatments: paper digestion in nitric acid, microwave treatment, DIN38414-54 method and TCLP method were 997μgg−1, 189μgg−1, 20.8μgg−1, and 54.0μgg−1, respectively. Flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were employed for lead determination according to the protocols of the applied methods. Lead contamination in used BKP was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (SEM-EDS). All the SEM imaging was carried out in the secondary electron mode (SE) and backscattered-electron mode (QBSD) following punctual X-ray fluorescence spectra. Soil contamination derived from this product revealed the urgent need of addressing this problem. These elevated Pb levels, show that a preliminary treatment of BKP is mandatory before it is disposed into the common trash. The high lead content of this material makes its direct dumping into the environment unwise."

abstract = "Background and objective
Female androgenetic alopecia (FAA) has considerable impact on quality of life. Our analysis of the clinical scales available in the literature to measure the impact of FAA led us to choose the Hair Specific Skindex 29 (HSS29) as the most appropriate for adaptation to Spanish as a tool for following patients in treatment for FAA. This tool assesses disease impact on quality of life over time so that treatments can be tailored to patients’ needs. The HSS29 score reflects impact in 3 domains (emotions, symptoms, and functioning) on a scale of 0 (no effect) to 100 (maximum effect). The scale is useful in routine clinical practice, and patients can respond to all items in 5minutes.
Materials and methods
We followed recommended procedures to produce a cross-cultural adaptation of the scale. The process involved forward translation of the questionnaire to Spanish followed by back translation by 2 native speakers of the original language (English) and revision as needed after discussion and consensus by a committee of 3 expert dermatologists. The comprehensibility of the resulting translation was assessed in a test–retest step. Next, the psychometric properties, reliability, and construct validity were assessed. Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, reliability with Cronbach's α, and construct validity by factor analysis using a Varimax rotation. Face validity was also assessed during the process. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated in the test–retest step.
Results
A total of 170 women with FAA and 30 control subjects completed the cross-culturally adapted Spanish questionnaire. A subgroup of 15 subjects responded a second time between 1 and 2 days after their first session (test–retest). Sensitivity and specificity were excellent according to the area under the ROC curve (0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99), and high reliability was reflected by a Cronbach's α of 0.96. Factor analysis showed that the items were grouped in the same 3 domains (functioning, emotions, and symptoms) as in the original version of the scale. There were no significant differences in the mean (SD) scores on the test and the retest (23.05 [16.42] vs 22.01 [17.72], respectively). The ICC of over 0.9 indicated excellent correlation between responses to the adapted Spanish version.
Conclusions
The psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the HSS29 are similar to those of the original scale. The Spanish HSS29 is a useful tool for assessing quality of life in FAA.

La escala HSS29 puntúa entre 0 (nula afectación) y 100 (total afectación) y discrimina 3dominios (emociones, síntomas y función), siendo una escala útil en la práctica clínica diaria, autocumplimentada en menos de 5 min.
Materiales y métodos
Se realizó el proceso metodológico establecido para la validación transcultural de una escala, a través de la traducción y retrotraducción por 2traductores nativos en la lengua original de la escala (inglés), con el consenso de un comité de 3dermatólogos expertos cuando fuera necesario. La versión consensuada se sometió a un pretest con pacientes para comprobar la correcta comprensión. Posteriormente, se determinaron las características psicométricas de la escala, la fiabilidad y su validez de constructo (sensibilidad y especificidad mediante curva ROC, fiabilidad por alfa de Cronbach, constructo por análisis factorial con rotación Varimax), de apariencia y la validez test-retest (correlación intraclase).
Resultados
Ciento setenta mujeres con alopecia y 30 controles respondieron a la escala. Un subgrupo de 15 pacientes realizó el test-retest y respondieron a la escala tras 1-2 días de la valoración inicial. La escala presentó una excelente sensibilidad y especificidad medida por la curva ROC 0,98 (intervalo de confianza del 95%, 0,97-0,99) y una muy elevada fiabilidad con alfa de Cronbach de 0,96. El análisis factorial mostró que los ítems se distribuyeron en las 3dimensiones (funcional, emociones y síntomas) como en la escala original. No se encontraron diferencias significativas entre los valores del test y del retest (23,05 ± 16,42 vs 22,01 ± 17,72, p = ns) y el coeficiente de correlación intraclase fue excelente (superior a 0,9).

Some studies have investigated the ecological interactions between species of Clusia and gall-inducing insects. The goal of our study is to characterise changes in leaf anatomy caused by the activity of gall insects in Clusia lanceolata. Additionally, we also investigated the chemical composition of volatile compounds of normal leaves and those with galls to detect possible effects on the host plants. For anatomical studies, we used botanical material fixed in FAA50. Transversal sections of the leaf blade were obtained from samples of leaves located on the third and fourth nodes from both male and female individuals. Material was studied from both sexes both with unaffected leaves and leaves containing galls. Fresh leaves of C. lanceolata were used for the extraction of volatile compounds, which were submitted to stem distillation using a modified Clevenger apparatus determining the oil yields subsequently (w/w). The unaffected leaves of female and male individuals of C. lanceolata exhibit similar anatomical structures. However, galls on leaves of both sexes show anatomical differences. The activity of the gall insect Clusiamyia nitida induces several changes in the foliar anatomy and the distribution of metabolic compounds in new tissues during gall development. However, the larvae are not able to induce significant changes in the volatile compounds of inflected leaves from male and female individuals."

After death, FAA concentration in A. franciscana nauplii reached a maximum about 2–2.5-fold higher than the initial concentration after 120 min at 16, 20, 24 and 28 °C. At 12 °C the maximum concentration of FAAs was achieved after 240 min. A significant effect of temperature on total FAAs (df=4, F-value=17.17, P<0.0001, ANOVA), indicated that the most pronounced proteolysis took place at 20 °C. Only small, albeit significant (P<0.05) differences were observed in FAA composition as influenced by temperature and duration of the proteolysis. The FAA composition of the freshly killed initial sample also differed from all treated samples. Our interpretation of these results is that there is considerable autolytic proteolysis during residence times that are possible in fish larvae, and that this may represent a significant contribution to FAAs for energy supply and protein synthesis."

In this study, we applied data mining methods on the incident reports. Moreover rough sets concept is used to reduce the attributes of data set. The purpose of this application is to find out the effective attributes in order to reduce the number of the fatality in the incidents. The categorization tools and decision trees are used to find the relations and rules about the incidents resulted in fatality. For this purpose data-mining analysis is conducted. As a result some rules about the fatality are obtained and also the parameters that affect the fatality in the incident have determined. The rules found are tested in terms of their accuracy and reliability, and these results are seen to be meaningful."

The method is based on the ion-association of stable anionic oxalate complexes of V(V) and Mo(VI) with [9-(diethylamino)benzo[a]phenoxazin-5-ylidene]azanium; sulfate (Nile blue A) at pH 4.5, and then extraction of the formed ion-association complexes into micellar phase of polyoxyethylene(7.5)nonylphenyl ether (PONPE 7.5). The UTA-CPE is greatly simplified and accelerated compared to traditional cloud point extraction (CPE). The analytical parameters optimized are solution pH, the concentrations of complexing reagents (oxalate and Nile blue A), the PONPE 7.5 concentration, electrolyte concentration, sample volume, temperature and ultrasonic power. Under the optimum conditions, the calibration curves for Mo(VI) and V(V) are obtained in the concentration range of 3–340µgL−1 and 5–250µgL−1 with high sensitivity enhancement factors (EFs) of 145 and 115, respectively.

The accuracy of the method was assessed by analysis of two standard reference materials (SRMs) and recoveries of spiked solutions. The method was successfully applied into the determination of trace amounts of Mo(VI) and V(V) in milk, vegetables and foodstuffs with satisfactory results."

One component is software that jointly optimizes the timing of arriving traffic to streamline flight arrivals at congested airports (Aircraft Arrival Management Systems or AAMS). Since most of the proposed NextGen improvements are not yet implemented, their evaluations typically are conducted through modeling, simulation, and/or subject matter expert surveys. In contrast, this study utilizes experimental settings in a real-time operating environment to examine potential benefits of the AAMS. During the experiment, a number of system performance variables were recorded in two data collection periods: a passive period, when the system was operating without the AAMS, and an active period, when the AAMS optimized arriving traffic of a dominant airline. Due to confounding data issues, the results indicate that with only 6.5 percent of arriving traffic optimized, there are no observable improvements in the overall system performance. However, the study documents tangible benefits for optimized flights and a positive interaction effect between the FAA's Traffic Management Advisor and the AAMS."

Samples originated from conventional wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) using activated sewage sludge as well as from a pilot-scale WWTP operating in mixed mode (activated sewage sludge and cascade biofilms reactors with biofilms growing on fix beds and roots of greenhouse plants). Results of the present study confirmed the outcomes of our previous report according to which, 4-FAA was the most persistent metabolite, while 4-AAA and 4-MAA could be determined in the highest and lowest concentration, respectively. Moreover, the study of intraday variation of the concentration of these metabolites revealed that the concentration of 4-AA, 4-AAA and 4-FAA registered a 46%–75% increase in the samples collected at noon compared to those collected at 6 AM. Chlorination did not affect considerably the removal efficiency (about 15%) of these metabolites in samples collected for 3 months consecutively before and after disinfection. Both wastewater treatment techniques efficiently removed 4-AAA (between 80 and 96%). However, in the summer season, the removal efficiency of conventional WWTP using open-air aerated tanks is lower by 30%, (on average) than in the cold season. The concentration of the investigated metabolites showed increased concentrations in the winter season confirming the intake habits of the population from this popular analgesic and antipyretic drug."

The earliest protection objectives focused exclusively on protection against fatalities. The initial risk measure employed was the probability the most exposed individual would be killed. Over time, the protection objectives have broadened. Many facilities now protect against multiple levels of injury (typically, severe injury or casualties, and fatalities). Most facilities have established some maximum tolerable societal, or collective, risk that is considered tolerable. Some facilities have placed limits on tolerable catastrophic risk as measured by the probability that large numbers of people may be simultaneously injured. The 2010 publication of the Range Commanders Council guidance document, RCC 321, broadened protection objectives by defining the basis for protecting critical assets that are a part of the launch complex. These criteria ensured that the chance of damaging the critical infrastructure required for continued operations of the launch complex and the facilities required for emergency response to a mishap were sufficiently small. For commercial launches the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Office of Commercial Space Transportation (AST) has promulgated financial responsibility standards based on the Maximum Probable Loss (MPL) that will result from launch operations. The MPL is a combined measure of potential damage and injury that may occur from events with extremely remote likelihood. Individual ranges have imposed a variety of protection standards to protect unique resources including environmentally sensitive assets. As launch operations become more common, once isolated launch complexes are surrounded by industry and communities they support. Zoning regulations rarely consider the constraints these developments may impose on launch operations. Moreover, current safety regulations are confined to protecting these communities from injuries resulting from launch operations."

Key parameters that influence analyte recovery were investigated and optimized, using the fish protein certified reference material (CRM, DORM-3) throughout the procedure. In this method, 100mg of the sample was dissolved in ChCl–Ox (1:2, molar ratio) at 100°C for 45min. Then, 5.0mL HNO3 (1.0M) was added. After centrifugation, the supernatant solution was filtered, diluted to a known volume, and analyzed by FAAS. Under optimized conditions, an excellent agreement between the obtained results and the certified values was observed, using Student's t-test (P=0.05); the extraction recovery of the all elements was greater than 95.3%. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of analytes in different tissues (muscle, liver, and gills) having a broad concentration range in a marine fish sample. The reproducibility of the method was validated by analyzing all samples by our method in a different laboratory, using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). For comparison, a conventional acid digestion (CAD) method was also used for the determination of analytes in all studied samples. The simplicity of the proposed experimental procedure, high extraction efficiency, short analysis time, lack of concentrated acids and oxidizing agents, and the use of safe and inexpensive components demonstrate the high potential of ChCl–Ox (1:2) for routine trace metal analysis in biological samples."

Therefore the studies on the effect of metal ions on surfactants properties are of great importance to gain insight into the interactions between these chemicals both in natural environment and during purification processes. The aim of this work was to verify the effect of lead(II) ions on the aggregation of the anionic surfactants: sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), N-Lauroylsarcosine sodium salt (Sarkosyl) and Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) and to compare the ability of these surfactants to bind these metal ions. The experiments involved electrical conductance measurements of surfactant solutions containing lead(II) ions in various concentrations, pH measurements, potentiometric experiments and the flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The analysis of the calculated aggregation parameters and association constants as well as FAAS experiments results evidenced that among the studied surfactants SDS is of the highest, while SDBS of the lowest lead(II) ions binding ability. However, all the investigated compounds at the concentrations lower than Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) form insoluble complexes with these metal ions. The precipitates differ in their stability, namely they dissolve at the excess of surfactant, however, for SDS this process starts at higher surfactant level as in the case of SDBS and Sarkosyl. Moreover, binding of lead(II) ions to the negatively charged surfactant micelles is the most effective in the case of SDS and the weakest for SDBS."

The results evidenced that both studied metal ions form aggregates of different stability with SDS and Sarkosyl at the concentrations below critical micelle concentration and they are able to bind also to the negatively charged micelles. SDS was found to be more effective than Sarkosyl in binding metal ions, however, both surfactants manifested stronger binding capacity to Cd2+ as compared to Zn2+. It was also summarized that the ability of SDS and Sarkosyl to bind metal ions changes in the following order: Pb2+>Cd2+>Zn2+. The foregoing findings were discussed in the relation to the differences in the values of the hydrated ionic radii and the enthalpies of hydration of the studied metal ions."

abstract = "A simple and selective method for the determination of cadmium in water samples by FAAS after solid phase extraction has been developed. The method is based on the sorption of cadmium as CdI42− on octadecyl silica membrane disks modified by cationic surfactant of methyltrioctylammonium chloride in the pH range of 1–8. The sorbed cadmium is then eluted with 10ml of 1moll−1 nitric acid in ethanol and is measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The influence of flow rates of eluent and sample solution, iodide concentration and amount of surfactant in retention and elution of cadmium from disks was also investigated. A preconcentration factor of 100 was achieved by passing 1000ml of sample through the membrane disk. The limit of detection (LOD) of cadmium was found to be 0.014ngml−1. Precision at 2.5μgl−1 was 1.2% (n=8). The method was successfully applied to the determination of cadmium in some natural water samples. The accuracy was assessed through recovery experiment, independent analysis by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry, and analysis of certified reference waters."

Studies were carried out with seedlings of two forage maize varieties (Aristo and Arper) subjected to 0, 34, 68 and 102mM NaCl for 6 weeks under glasshouse conditions. Osmotic potential (OP), osmotic adjustment (OA) and solutes accumulation were quantified in primary roots and in three leaf stages (young, mature and senescent leaves). Moreover, in order to assess the distribution of proline and glycine betaine during root development, the two components were analyzed at different position from the primary root apex of both varieties. The total dry matter was significantly dropped with increasing salinity and reduction was greater in Aristo than in Arper. Salt stress impact in terms of ionic status was more pronounced in roots than in leaves and in older leaves than younger ones. In this setting, Aristo displayed a more sensitivity than Arper. A close relationship between the age of root–leaf tissue and proline and glycine betaine allocation, as salinity response, was shown. During the stress treatment, the accumulation of the two components was higher in growing regions of roots and in young leaves. While total free amino acids (FAA) and sugars were accumulated in roots as well as leaves but preferentially in the mature leaves. The capacity of OA was greater in young than in mature and/or senescent leaves and the contribution efficiency of organic solutes to this occurrence tended to be higher in Arper than in Aristo. Moreover, glycine betaine and proline appeared to be the main solutes that contributed ably to OA mainly in growing regions followed by sugars and other FAA. Inorganic solutes (K+ and Ca2+), however, did not seem to play an important role in OA since their amounts were often reduced in response to salt tolerance."

Repair and preservation of the native valve avoids the use of long-term anticoagulation, lowers the incidence of subsequent thromboembolic events and reduces the risk of endocarditis. Additionally repair has a low operative mortality with reasonable mid-term durability. The success and longer term durability of AVPP has improved with surgical experience. An understanding of the mechanism of the AR is integral to determining feasibility and success of an AVPP. Assessment of AV morphology, anatomy of the functional aortic annulus (FAA) and the aortic root with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) improves the understanding of the mechanisms of AR. Pre- and intra-operative TEE plays a pivotal role in guiding case selection, surgical planning, and in evaluating procedural success. Post-operative transthoracic echocardiography is useful to determine long-term success and monitor for recurrence of AR."

LDPS is equipped with a dedicated limited-range wavelength converters (LRWCs, and a shared pool of parametric wavelength converters (PWCs) with dynamic pump-wavelength selection (DPS). The adoption of hybrid conversion types in the proposed architecture aims at improving the packet loss rate (PLR) compared to conventional architecture with single conversion types, while reducing (or at least maintaining) the conversion distance (d) of used wavelength converters. Packet contention in the proposed architecture is resolved using the first available algorithm (FAA) and the dynamic pump-wavelength selection algorithm (DPSA). The performance of the proposed architecture is compared to two well-known conventional architectures; namely, the LRWC architecture that uses dedicated LRWCS for each input wavelength, and the DPS architecture that uses a shared pool of dynamic pump-wavelength converters (PWCs). Simulation results show that, for the same value of d, the new architecture reduces the PLR compared to the LRWC architecture by up to 40% and 99.7% for traffic loads, 0.5 and 1; respectively. In addition, for d=1, the new architecture reduces the PLR compared to the DPS architecture by up to 10% and 99.3% for traffic loads, 0.5 and 1; respectively."

In the United States, it is widely believed that the major culprits for delay throughout the NAS are the three New York commercial airports – Newark (EWR), LaGuardia (LGA), and John F. Kennedy (JFK). Various estimates of the extent to which the New York airports impact the delay in the NAS have been reported over the years. Yet there is no thorough investigation into the mutual relationship between delays at New York and non-New York airports. In this paper, we take two different approaches to quantify the impact of the three New York airports on delay throughout the NAS. First, we estimate and apply an econometric model using a large historical dataset. The other model is the FAA SWAC model that simulates flights and tracks the daily performance of the system. The counterfactual scenarios in these two models are adjusted to be comparable to each other. There is disparity between the results of the two different models, suggesting the simulation model might not capture all the factors that cause arrival delay. Still both results conclude that the portion of delay in the system caused by New York airports is much less than publicized estimates. Combining econometric and simulation models to address questions of this nature appears to be a promising approach."

The yield of metabolites is dependent on the strain of E. gracilis and the metabolic growth condition. Here we investigated the effects of photoautotrophic (PT), mixotrophic (MT) and heterotrophic (HT) cultivation on the synthesis of ascorbate, α-tocopherol and faa in E. gracilis var. saccharophila, using label-free shotgun proteomics, and metabolite analysis using colourimetric assay, high-performance and ultra-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC/UPLC). PT cultivation resulted in the production of more antioxidants (up to 4.13mgg−1 ascorbate and 2.52mgg−1 α-tocopherol) than the MT and HT growth conditions (up to 0.97 and 0.50mgg−1 ascorbate, and 1.40 and 0.21mgg−1 α-tocopherol, respectively). The relative abundance of several faa varied between mid-log and initial stationary growth phases, but the total amount of faa remained about the same, with arginine as the most abundant amino acid. Proteomic analysis revealed a total of 3843 non-redundant proteins in E. gracilis var. saccharophila, of which 1890 were common among all cultivations. Gene ontology annotations suggested derivatisation of metabolic pathways from different organisms, such as lysine biosynthesis from fungi and serine biosynthesis from plants, while a few pathways were unique to Euglena, such as those of ascorbate and arginine. Some enzymes exhibited several isoforms that were influenced by the metabolic growth condition. For example, one of the isozymes of threonine aldolase was expressed in HT/MT cultures only, and one of the isozymes of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase was expressed in PT cultures only. This is the first proteomic study of E. gracilis var. saccharophila, which provides a mechanistic insight into the biosynthetic pathway dynamics of primary metabolites (antioxidants and faa). This new information can serve as a framework for further development of Euglena as a producer of nutraceuticals."

Partial least square regression (PLSR) method was further applied to explore the correlations. Results suggested that pH decreased more significantly in RXCs, and a more dark brown color was observed in RXs with the increase of heating temperatures. The lowest bitterness MRPs were obtained by heating at 140 °C with cysteine (RXC-140), while the highest umami and saltiness sample was found in RX-100. Bitter and umami FAAs were present in greater amounts at higher temperatures with cysteine. Furthermore, RXC showed a meat-like flavor due to the generation of sulfur-containing compounds, and more furans and nitrogen-containing compounds were detected in RX, along with a caramel-like flavor."

In order to decrease the number of bird strikes or alleviate the consequences of a bird strike, several solutions have been implemented by the aviation authorities worldwide, including enforcing strict regulations on the required safety characteristics of new aircraft and using bird avoidance techniques. Most of the avoidance techniques are used in the airfields, including aircraft flight schedule modification, bird habitat modification and exclusion, wildlife removal, bird harassment, and making the airfield unattractive to birds. Moreover, weather radar systems and digital imaging techniques are now implemented for creating bird distribution maps which can be helpful when modifying flight paths. On-board bird harassment equipment is also useful, although the effectiveness of this on-board equipment ranks as the least effective of all the techniques available. All the noted prevention strategies will be reviewed and discussed. In the final parts of the chapter, the regulations enforced by the USA’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Joint Aviation Authority (EJAA) are reviewed which are the criteria for assurance of the robustness of the different aircraft components against single or multiple bird impacts using mechanical engineering concepts; this will be described in detail in the forthcoming chapters."

The experiment was conducted for 70days on the juveniles of Nile tilapia (18±2.1g) exposed to the total ammonia nitrogen concentration (TAN) of 5 (LL) or 10 (HH) mgL−1 in a static water system at 26°C. The activities of c-alanine aminotransferase (c-ALT), c-aspartate aminotransferase (c-AST), c-malic enzyme (c-ME), m-malic enzyme (m-ME), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in the amination direction, and glutamine synthetase (GSase) in fish exposed to one of these sublethal TAN concentrations were significantly increased. The increase in the enzyme activity was positively related to the level of the tested TAN concentration. However, the activity of m-ALT and glutaminase (GLase) was significantly decreased, and that of m-AST did not show any significant changes. On the other hand, in Nile tilapia exposed to HH, there was a significant increase in the levels of free amino acids (FAAs), such as alanine, glutamine, glycine, histidine, serine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA); however, no alteration in asparagine was observed, and there was a significant decrease in the levels of aspartate and glutamate. The significant increase in FAAs levels in fish exposed to LL was mainly attributable to alanine, glutamine, and GABA, and the importance of these metabolic changes in the cytosolic and mitochondrial ALT, AST, and ME was discussed."

This dataset allows us to re-evaluate the application of amino acid racemization (AAR) for dating late Holocene coral material, 20years after Goodfriend et al. (GCA 56 (1992), 3847) first showed AAR had promise for developing chronologies in coral cores. This re-assessment incorporates recent method improvements, including measurement by RP-HPLC, new quality control approaches (e.g. sampling and sub-sampling protocols, statistically-based data screening criteria), and cleaning steps to isolate the intra-crystalline skeletal protein. We show that the removal of the extra-crystalline contaminants and matrix protein is the most critical step for reproducible results and recommend a protocol of bleaching samples in NaOCl for 48h to maximise removal of open system proteins while minimising the induced racemization. We demonstrate that AAR follows closed system behaviour in the intra-crystalline fraction of the coral skeletal proteins. Our study is the first to assess the natural variability in intra-crystalline AAR between colonies, and we use coral cores taken from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, and Jarvis Island in the equatorial Pacific to explore variability associated with different environmental conditions and thermal histories. Chronologies were developed from THAA Asx D/L, Ala D/L, Glx D/L and FAA Asx D/L for each core and least squares Monte Carlo modelling applied in order to quantify uncertainty of AAR age determinations and assess the level of dating resolution possible over the last 5 centuries. AAR within colonies follow consistent stratigraphic aging. However, there are systematic differences in rates between the colonies, which would preclude direct comparison from one colony to another for accurate age estimation. When AAR age models are developed from a combined dataset to include this natural inter-colony variability THAA Asx D/L, Glx D/L and Ala D/L give a 2σ age uncertainty of ±19, ±38 and ±29year, for the 20th C respectively; in comparison 2σ age uncertainties from a single colony are ±12, ±12 and ±14year. This is the first demonstration of FAA D/L for dating coral and following strict protocols 2σ precisions of ±24years can be achieved across different colonies in samples from the last 150years, and can be ±10years within a core from a single colony. Despite these relatively large error estimates, AAR would be a valuable tool in situations where a large number of samples need to be screened rapidly and cheaply (e.g. identifying material from mixed populations in beach or uplift deposits), prior to and complementing the more time-consuming geochronological tools of U/Th or seasonal isotopic timeseries."

Contrarily to previous studies, from the five wineries analyzed, only one showed the highest BA formation during malolactic fermentation (9.2 ± 0.1 mg L−1). The other wineries showed the highest formation during alcoholic fermentation (n = 1; 40.2 ± 0.3 mg L−1), in bottled wine (n = 2; 38.3 ± 0.0 and 168.6 ± 0.2 mg L−1), or without significant differences along vinification (<16 mg L−1). In all wineries a tendency between FAA decrease and BA increase was observed. Different BA and FAA profiles were observed with putrescine and lysine as the most prevalent amines. Toxicologically important amines, histamine and tyramine, were found in low concentrations (<3.5 mg L−1), except in one bottled wine that showed values of 8.4 mg L−1 and 8.1 mg L−1, respectively.

Free fatty acids (FFA), partial glycerides, free amino acids (FAA), gross composition and sensory characteristics were determined at different ripening times in cheeses manufactured with three different amounts of commercial animal lipase or with lipase-containing artisanal lamb rennet paste. The addition of lipase increased the content of total FFA, particularly of short-chain FFA, and that of total partial glycerides in cheeses. Unexpectedly, lipase utilization significantly affected total FAA concentration, which decreased in cheeses elaborated with high lipase amount. In general, Val, Glu and Leu were the major FAA, and their concentrations depended, mainly, on ripening time. Lipase addition had significant influence on the sensory characteristics of the cheeses, increasing scores for most of the flavour and odour attributes of the cheese. Principal component analysis (PCA) was done including dry matter, FFA, FAA, partial glycerides and odour and flavour attributes of the cheeses. It indicated that aroma and flavour parameters of Idiazabal cheese and the content of short-chain FFA and diglycerides were highly correlated to first principal component (PC1), while texture parameters, compositional variables and FAA were correlated to the second principal component (PC2)."

The relationship between activity in the left and right prefrontal activity is used to assess brain states and specifically their link to motivational behaviours and tendencies. The most common measure used in this context is called the frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA), which compares alpha (8–13Hz) power at each region. Interestingly, research shows that FAA is influenced by aerobic exercise by increasing relative left prefrontal cortex activity. In turn this effect may be beneficial for individuals with mood disorders that are associated with abnormal motivational tendencies. However, it is unknown whether changes in FAA after exercise are due to cardiovascular demands of activity or simply the movement required for the exercise. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the influence of aerobic exercise and ‘no intensity’ bilateral movement cycling on FAA in young healthy adults. Results showed aerobic exercise caused a significant increase in FAA scores 22–38min after exercise. However, movement did not lead to a significant change in FAA. This suggests there is an intensity required for physical activity to evoke a change in FAA."

abstract = "In recent years growing evidence has shown that organic nitrogen (ON) constitutes a significant fraction of the nitrogen budget in particulate matter (PM). However, the composition and sources of ON in Chinese PM are not clear to date due to the lack of field measurements and receptor modeling interpretations. In this study, water-soluble ON (WSON), free amino acids (FAAs) and primary amines, together with water-soluble ionic species and carbonaceous components, were quantified in PM2.5 collected in Xi'an, China from 2008 to 2009. The yearly average WSON concentration (300 nmol Nm−3, ranging from 29 to 1250 nmol Nm−3) was one order of magnitude higher than that reported in other urban and rural regions in U.S. A total of 24 organic nitrogen species were determined, with an average total concentration of 2180 pmol m−3, which account for 1.2% of the WSON in PM2.5. Glycine, β-alanine and methylamine were the most abundant protein type amino acid, non-protein type amino acid and primary amine, respectively, contributing to 21.1%, 5.2% and 20.6% of the total quantified organic nitrogen species (TONS). Strong linear correlations (Pearson's correlation) (r = .72, p < 0.001) between WSON and one of biomass burning tracer (K+) potentially indicate the contribution from biomass burning (especially in spring and fall) and the correlation (r = .76–.87, p < 0.001) between WSON and secondary species (NH4+, NO3−, and SO42−) also suggests the important contribution to WSON from secondary formation processes. Moreover, both protein type amino acids and primary amines revealed good correlations with water-soluble ions in spring, which indicates that seasonal variability occurred in primary sources and secondary formation pathway of the organic nitrogen species were found in Xi'an."

In nature, ion homeostasis is affected mainly by three processes: 1. Environmental stress factors, 2. Developmental effects, and 3. Loss or gain-of-function mutations in the plant genome. Here we present a rapid total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) protocol that allows for simultaneous quantification of several elements such as potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), manganese (Mn) and strontium (Sr) in Arabidopsis thaliana leaf specimens. Our procedure is cost-efficient and enables precise, robust and highly reproducible measurements on tissue samples as small as 0.3mg dry weight. As shown here, we apply the TXRF procedure to detect accurately the early replacement of K by Na ions in leaves of plants exposed to soil salinity, a globally increasing abiotic stress factor. Furthermore, we were able to prove the existence of a leaf development-dependent ion gradient for K, Ca, and other divalent ions in A. thaliana; i.e. old leaves contain significantly lower K but higher Ca than young leaves. Lastly, we show that our procedure can be readily applied to reveal subtle differences in tissue-specific ion contents of plant mutants. We employed independent A. thaliana kea1kea2 loss-of-function mutants that lack KEA1 and KEA2, two highly active chloroplast K exchange proteins. We found significantly increased K levels specifically in kea1kea2 mutants, i.e. 55mg∗g−1 dry weight, compared to 40mg∗g−1 dry weight in wild type plants. The TXRF procedure can be supplemented with Flame atomic absorption (FAAS) and emission spectrometry (FAES) to expand the detection range to sodium (Na) and magnesium (Mg). Because of the small sample amounts required, this method is especially suited to probe individual leaves in single plants or even specific leaf areas. Therefore, TXRF represents a powerful method to gain detailed quantitative insights into I) the effect of environmental stress on plant ion homeostasis, II) ion gradients between plant tissues, and III) ion levels in plant mutants with compromised growth or heterogeneous phenotypes."

abstract = "Springtails are closely related to insects, but they differ from these with respect to water balance, in particular because springtails are small and have high integumental permeability to water. Here we report a series of experiments addressing the dynamics of osmoregulation, water content and accumulation of free amino acids (FAAs) in three springtail species during exposure to a gradually increasing environmental desiccation simulating conditions in drought exposed soil. Folsomia candida and Protaphorura fimata (both living in the deeper soil layers; euedaphic species) were active throughout the 3week exposure, with the developing drought regime ending at −3.56MPa (the soil water activity at the permanent wilting point of plants is −1.5MPa) and remained hyperosmotic (having an body fluid osmolality higher than the corresponding environment) to their surrounding air. Sinella curviseta (living in upper soil/litter layers; hemiedaphic species) also survived this exposure, but remained hypoosmotic throughout (i.e. with lower osmolality than the environment). The body content of most FAAs increased in response to drought in all three species. Alanine, proline and arginine were the most significantly upregulated FAAs. By combining our results with data in the literature, we could account for 82% of the observed osmolality at −3.56MPa in F. candida and 92% in P. fimata. The osmolality of S. curviseta was only slightly increased under drought, but here FAAs were considerably more important as osmolytes than in the two other species. We propose that FAAs probably have general importance in drought tolerance of springtails."

In order to explore the physiological responses to dry conditions, we simulated a natural drought incident in a laboratory trial exposing worms in slowly drying soil for about one month, and then analyzed the whole-body contents of free amino acids (FAAs). We investigated three species forming estivation chambers when soils dry out (Aporrectodea tuberculata, Aporrectodea icterica and Aporrectodea longa) and one species that does not estivate during drought (Lumbricus rubellus). Worms subjected to drought conditions (< −2MPa) substantially increased the concentration of FAAs and in particular alanine that was significantly upregulated in all tested species. Alanine was the most important FAA reaching 250–650μmolg−1 dry weight in dehydrated Aporrectodea species and 300μmolg−1 dry weight in L. rubellus. Proline was only weakly upregulated in some species as were a few other FAAs. Species forming estivation chambers (Aporrectodea spp.) did not show a better ability to conserve body water than the non-estivating species (L. rubellus) at the same drought level. These results suggest that the accumulation of alanine is an important adaptive trait in drought tolerance of earthworms in general."

Moghania philippinensis (Merr. et Rolfe) Li, M. macrophylla (Willd.) O. Kuntze and M. ferruginea (Wall. ex Benth.) Li. (Leguminosae) has not the national standards now, and they are just only recorded in appendix of “Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China” (2010 and 2005 edition). But their roots are the crude herbs recourses of the primary ingredient in the famous prescription of “Female Moghania Tablet” for curing colpitis in China. Moreover M. philippinensis was also recorded by the appendix “Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China” (1977 edition). M. strobilifera (Linn.) Ait, M. glutiaosa (Prain) Y.T.Wei, and M. Latifolia Benth are still medical used in some local region of Guangxi and Yunnan Province of China. So their crude herbs recourses are confused in Chinese Crude Herbs Market.
Objective
To distinguish three species of Moghania and ensure their safety and efficacy.
Materials and methods
Three species of M. macrophylla (Willd.) O.Kuntze, M. Latifolia Benth and M. glutiaosa (Prain) Y.T.Wei from Guangxi, Yunnan and Sichuan Province of China (SWUN) (Table 1). Fresh materials were fixed in FAA. Samples were passed through the traditional ethanol and dimethylbenzene series, embedded in paraffin, and then sliced with a microtome and stained with safranine-fast green and finally mounted. The leaf lower epidermal cells are obtained by the practical peeling technique and clearing method with nail polish blot. The materials were dissociated by nitric acid chromate method. The samples of herbs were powdered. The average number of palisade cell under the epidermal cells is called Palisade Ratio (PR). Since palisade ratio is consistent and different from plant to plant, this parameter can be used in authentication. Stomatal Index (SI) is a basilic parameter in authentication, which can be obtained from the following formula: Stomatal Index = (number of stomata/every millimeter-square) × 100/(number of stomata/every millimeter-square + number of epidermal cell/every millimeter-square). Mesophyll tissue is divided up by slendest vein, which is called vein islet. The numbers of vein islet in every epidermal cell is called Vein Islet Numbers (VIN), which also can be used as a reliable parameter in authentication since it is consistent in a species of plant. The results were studied using light microscope according to the usual microscopic techniques.
Results
The three species of Moghania were studied to compare the distinguishing morphoanatomic details of root, stem, leaf and petiole, dissociation and powders. The microscopic features were systematically described and illustrated. And detailed key authentication parameters based on these anatomic characteristics were presented. A key was constructed to the three species for convenient classification. Microscopy can be unambiguously used to authenticate and distinguish three species of Moghania."

We describe the performance of two Fourier-based PSD algorithms, Fourier Gradient Analysis (FGA) and Fourier Area Analysis (FAA), and compare their performance to the Charge Comparison Method (CCM). To compare the algorithms’ PSD performance the figure of merit (FoM) was calculated at various energies for each of the algorithms. The CCM analysed the pulses in the time domain whereas the other two algorithms processed the pulses within the frequency domain. Moreover, the detector was tested with different acquisition record lengths, in order to determine any impact on algorithm performance. It was determined that the FAA algorithm provided the best overall performance achieving a FoM of 1.57(1) at 1MeVee with a 1.6µs record length. Furthermore, the detector was tested using different load resistors which allowed the decay time of the pulses to be optimised. The influence of SiPM pulse decay time on the performance of the PSD algorithms is also presented."

abstract = "Although technology advancement can pack more and more physical registers in processors, the numbers of architectural registers defined by the instruction set architectures (ISAs) remain relatively small on most modern processors. Exposing more architectural registers to compilers and programmers can improve the effectiveness of compiler optimization and the quality of code. However, increasing the number of architectural registers by simply adding extra bits to the register fields of instructions will expand the code size. Therefore, a better way of exposing more ISA registers without significantly expanding the code size is needed. This paper presents a new ISA called Floating Accumulator Architecture (FAA) that can expand the number of ISA registers without increasing the instruction length. Unlike the accumulator architecture whose accumulator is a fixed, special register, FAA dynamically chooses a register from the general-purpose register file as the accumulator. In other words, the accumulator in FAA is an alias to some register in the register file at any instruction, and the alias relation can be dynamically updated by FAA at any program points. Since the accumulator implicitly stores the result, the destination register field can be omitted from FAA instructions, resulting in a saving of 3 to 5 bits for each instruction. This new free instruction bit space can be utilized in two possible ways: doubling the number of ISA registers of modern 32-bit RISC processors or maintaining the number of ISA registers for 16-bit instructions on embedded processors. This paper presents the result of utilizing the free bit space to double the number of ISA registers from 16 to 32 on ARM processors, and experimental results show that performance can be improved by 7.6% on average for MediaBench benchmarks."

This regulation restricted the flight path to 60 minutes’ flying time to a suitable airport, therefore affecting the operation costs and limiting the range of twin-jet aircraft. However, improvements to the engine’s reliability in the following decades allowed ETOPS certification for twin-jet aircraft. The traditional trijet designs were slowly retired, the last commercial trijet flight was in 2014.The industry abandoned the trijet design as solution for commercial aviation; however, executive jets such as the Falcon 7x and Falcon 8x, certified in 2016, show that this configuration might still be advantageous for specific markets. The certification at one engine inoperative condition presents advantage for trijet aircraft reducing take-off thrust, since when one engine is inoperative, 75% of the installed thrust is available for the trijet aircraft, while this value is only 50% for a twin-jet aircraft. An initial study conducted showed a trend of lower thrust to weight ratio for trijet aircraft when compared to twin-jet aircraft, being particularly evident for MTOW (maximum take-off weight) lower than 75,000 lb. The aim of this work is to study the viability of a trijet aircraft configuration and potential advantages for a regional aviation scenario. The trijet configuration performance was evaluated and compared to twin-jet configuration in a multidisciplinary design environment considering disciplines such as aerodynamics, noise, performance, flight mechanic, weight, and structure. An aircraft with MTOW of 48,500 lb was studied and the results show that a reduction up to 9.4% of installed thrust might be achieved with the trijet design compared to twin-jet aircraft when the balanced field length is the critical constraint. However, flyover noise and structural weight might increase slightly in trijet design."

Systolic arterial pressures and plasma lipid levels of IL-1Ra−/− mice and wild-type (WT) mice did not differ significantly. However, IL-1Ra−/− mice spontaneously developed fusiform FAAs. Real-time PCR of 9-month-old IL-1Ra−/− mice revealed significantly increased mRNA levels of IL-1β (6.6-fold), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (12.4-fold), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (6.0-fold) compared with WT mice. Histological analysis revealed numerous inflammatory cells around the FAAs in IL-1Ra−/− mice, and elastin staining showed destruction of both the internal and external elastic lamina in IL-1Ra−/− mice. Afterward, macrophage function was studied. After lipopolysaccharide (1 μg/mL) stimulation, IL-1Ra–deficient macrophages produced much higher levels of TNF-α than those from WT mice. Finally, we performed bone marrow cell transplantation. FAAs with many inflammatory cells in the adventitia were detected in several WT mice that received bone marrow cells from IL-1Ra−/− mice (44%), but not from WT mice (0%). Our study is the first to demonstrate that IL-1Ra deficiency in inflammatory cells disrupts immune system homeostasis and induces inflammatory FAAs in IL-1Ra−/− B6 mice. We believe that these mice will provide much information about the natural history and management of FAAs."

Colour Doppler Sonography (CDS) in giant cell arteritis (GCA) allows the study of involvement of cranial arteries other than the temporal arteries, which are inconvenient to biopsy, such as the facial (FaA), and occipital (OcA) arteries. We aimed to estimate the frequency of the FaA, and OcA involvement in GCA; and to explore the clinical characteristics of these subgroups of patients.
Methods
From 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016 we prospectively performed a CDS of the FaA, and OcA in addition to the temporal (TA), and the extracranial supra-aortic arteries in all newly diagnosed patients suspected of having GCA. All the arteries were evaluated in two planes for the highly specific halo sign.
Results
During the 36-month observation period we performed a CDS of the cranial and extra-cranial arteries in 93 GCA patients. We observed the halo sign on the FaA, and OcA in 38 (40.9%), and 29 (31.2%) cases, respectively. The FaA, or OcA were affected in 4/22 (18.2%) patients with a negative TA CDS. FaA involvement significantly correlated with jaw claudication and with severe visual manifestations, including permanent visual loss.
Conclusions
A fifth of patients with a negative CDS of the TAs had signs of vasculitis on the CDS of the FaA, or OcA. The addition of FaA and OcA CDS to the routine CDS of the TAs could identify 4.3% more patients and thus further improve the sensitivity of the CDS in the suspected GCA."

The current design program, FAARFIELD, does not address reflective cracking for asphalt-overlaid concrete pavements due to its mechanism complexity. The bending, shearing, and thermal are three crucial factors to successfully model reflective cracking. To implement this failure mode in flexible over rigid design procedure, a series of full-scale test pavements were constructed, instrumented, and tested in the condition of extreme cooling temperature at the FAA National Airport Pavement Test Facility. The purpose was to assess cooling effects on the propagation of reflection cracks for airport AC over PCC pavements. In preparation for reflective cracking phase VI test, the FAA is conducting laboratory experiment on field extracted hot mix asphalt (HMA) cores. In order to test these field HMA cores, the Texas Overlay Tester (OT) was customized to get data similar to the full-scale tests. This paper discusses finite element analysis on the full-scale testing, development of the customized Texas OT, and a laboratory testing suite using the customized Texas OT, including preliminary tests, instrumentation, experiment design, and test results. Data obtained from this research effort will be used to develop a rational testing procedure to simulate extreme cooling cycles through full-scale testing."

We introduce deep learning method to solve this problem and propose a new semantic checking model based on Long Short-Time Memory network (LSTM) for intelligent read-back error checking. A mean-pooling layer is added to the traditional LSTM, so as to utilize the information obtained by all the hidden activation vectors, and also to improve the robustness of the semantic vector extracted by LSTM. A MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) layer, which can maintain the information of different regions in the concatenated vectors obtained by the mean-pooling layer, is applied instead of traditional similarity function in the new model to express the semantic similarity of the read-back pairs quantitatively. The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier is used to verify whether the read-back pairs are consistent in semantics according to the output of MLP layer. Extensive experiments are conducted and the results show that the proposed model is more effective and more robust than the traditional checking model to verify the semantic consistency of read-backs automatically."

The passage of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Modernization and Reform Act in 2012 acknowledged this fact, and has since prompted expedited research and development for civilian sUAS. As proposed at a recent National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Convention, central to the safe and efficient operations of sUAS will be an unmanned aircraft system traffic management (UTM) system. Such a UTM system will borrow fundamental ideas from large-scale air-traffic control, albeit with several key differences that provide for sUAS which vary in method of control, maneuverability, function, range, and operational constraints. Ultimately, an expansion of UTM infrastructure, a decentralization of governing authority over sUAS operations, and the establishment of a web-interface for pilots to submit flight plans and access crucial data will allow for sUAS operations to shift from being a science-fiction gimmick to an element of daily life. The major objectives of this paper are to: (1) define what a UTM system is; (2) review current UTM practice from industry partners; (3) describe how sUAS pilots would use a typical UTM system, and who has authority over UTM; and (4) determine what physical architecture is required in a UTM system which handles a large variety of sUAS."

abstract = "In some multi‐target tracking applications, appearing targets are suitably modeled as spawning from existing targets. However, in the original cardinalized probability hypothesis density (CPHD) filter, this type of model is not included; instead appearing targets are modeled by spontaneous birth only. Recently, two versions of CPHD filter modeling spawning targets have already been developed, but these two methods are tractable only when the spawning targets cardinality distribution is restricted to be the Bernoulli distribution, the Poisson distribution or the Zero-inflated Poisson distribution. In this paper, we derive a generalized CPHD filter which is tractable and has no constraint of the cardinality distribution of the spawning targets, that is to say, the spawning targets cardinality distribution can be arbitrary. The derivation is based on the finite set statistics (FISST) and the Faà di bruno's determinant formula. Moreover, how this generalized CPHD filter degrades into the two previous versions is also given in this paper. The resulting filter is different from the original CPHD filter in two aspects: first, the prediction equation of the PHD function changes to be identical with that of the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter; and second, the cardinality distribution prediction equation is now an expression including the cardinality distribution information of the spawning targets. Simulation results show that the proposed method can response much faster than the original CPHD filter in target number estimate when spawning targets appear, and has a much smaller cardinality estimate variance than the PHD filter and the original CPHD filter. A comparison considering the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) metric also demonstrates the good performance of the proposed method."

The following parameters were determined: pH, salinity, electric conductivity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), the major cations (FAAS and ICP-OES) and the major anions (IC), as well as certain trace elements (ICP-OES). Samples of superficial sediments were taken in October 2009 and examined using Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) for their major and trace element content including rare earth elements (REE). Both lakes are highly alkaline with a dominance of Na>K>Si>Ca in cations and HCO3>CO3>Cl>F>SO4 in anions. Both lakes also exhibited high concentrations of Mo, As and fluoride. Due to an extreme draught from March to October 2009, the water level of Lake Nakuru dropped significantly. This created drastic evapoconcentration, with the total salinity rising from about 20‰ up to 63‰. Most parameters (DOC, Na, K, Ca, F, Mo and As) increased with falling water levels. A clear change in the quality of DOC was observed, followed by an almost complete depletion of dissolved Fe from the water phase. In Lake Bogoria the evapoconcentration effects were less pronounced (total salinity changed from about 40‰ to 48‰). The distributions of REE in the superficial sediments of Lake Nakuru and Lake Bogoria are presented here for the first time. The results show a high abundance of the REE and a very distinct Eu depletion of Eu/Eu*=0.33–0.45."

Irradiation at 1.5 to 4.5kGy led to significant variation in hydrolyzed amino acids (HAA), free amino acids (FAA), fatty acids, and volatile profiles. HAA contents did not show significant difference with respect to the applied irradiation dose, however FAA level significantly decreased according to a dose-dependent manner and storage time. Fatty acids showed a dose-dependent decrease but there was little effect of storage periods during 40days. Trans-fatty acids were not observed in irradiated and non-irradiated smoked duck meat. The levels of acids and sulfur compounds decreased with increasing irradiation doses and storage periods, whereas alcohols, aldehydes, and phenols increased as the storage periods increased. Thus, optimum dose of irradiation <3kGy may not cause the quality changes in smoked duck meat during storage.
Industrial relevance
Effects of e-beam irradiation were investigated on amino acids, fatty acids, and volatile profiles in smoked duck meat. E-beam irradiation applied at different doses may affect the contents of both hydrolyzed as well as free amino acids of smoked duck meat. The current research findings present the potential implications regarding effects of e-beam irradiation treatment on smoked duck meat during storage."

abstract = "In 2009 the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) introduced a slow crack-growth approach for certifying composite and adhesively-bonded structures. This approach requires that the growth of a delamination or disbond is slow, stable and predictable under cyclic-fatigue loads. To predict growth in aircraft structures requires a methodology for translating laboratory crack-growth data to full-scale structures. Whilst this need not be a fracture-mechanics based approach, the present paper focuses on fracture-mechanics approaches since they have been widely adopted for this purpose for certifying aircraft structures. This approach uses the ‘similitude hypothesis’ combined with the concept of a crack-driving force (CDF) to link the results from laboratory tests to the cyclic-fatigue behaviour seen in full-scale aircraft tests. The present paper reveals that the range of the strain-energy release rates, ΔG, is not a valid crack-driving force. In contrast, in the present paper, a valid scheme is identified and proven to be appropriate."

Cheeses produced by UHPH-treated milk presented higher hydrolysis of αs2-, β- and para-κ-casein than those made with pasteurised milk; however, cheeses made by homogenised-pasteurised milk exhibited the highest hydrolysis of αs1-and para-κ-caseins. The increase in proteolysis by the homogenisation process could be attributed to the increase in the exposure of substrates to proteolytic enzymes. The UHPH-treatment of milk significantly increased the levels of whey soluble nitrogen and hydrophobic and hydrophilic peptides, however, levels of free amino acids were reduced during the first days of ripening as a consequence of the decrease in the aminopeptidase activity. No significant differences were detected in free amino acid profiles of the different cheeses by the principal component analysis."

Our safety assessment is based on triple approach including: (1) profile of EIs in gels; (2) the actual amount of EIs in the appropriate amount of gel applied with a single administration (one drop) and (3) the daily exposure of EIs in analysed teething pharmaceuticals due to the maximum daily dose.

Prescription food for special medical purposes (FSMPs) and modified milk products (MMPs), available in pharmacies, are important for newborns and infants that are not breastfed. In the scientific literature there is a lack of comprehensive studies and corresponding safety assessment of the essential trace elements in these products.
Objective
The aim of this article was determination of Cu, Mn and Zn levels in the most frequently available prescription FSMPs (n = 6) and MMPs (n = 6) available in Polish pharmacies.
Methods
Flame absorption spectrometry (FAAS) following microwave induced digestion (concentrated nitric acid) was applied to determine the levels of the elements in the products.
Results
Our studies are based on a triple approach (1) the “raw results” of Cu, Mn and Zn levels (products in powdered form), (2) single intake - the level of each essential trace element consumed in one portion, (3) the daily intake depending on age and weight including comparison with Adequate Intake established by European Food Safety Authority.
Conclusion
The results show the occurrence of differences between the manufacturer’s declared composition and the finished product for consumption. The prescription FSMPs in comparison to MMPs available in Polish pharmacies contain similar levels of Cu, Mn and Zn. Our results show additionally that all of the products do not represent a health hazard to the newborns and infants. This is a pioneer study in terms of the safety assessment, and quality of prescription FSMPs and MMPs available in Polish pharmacies from toxicological and nutritional point of view."

abstract = "The effect of iron and iron/zinc supplementation on their levels in tissues of rats fed initially one of the three following regimen: C – control AIN-93 diet, D – iron deficient diet and R – diet with 50% reduction of all vitamins and minerals was investigated. The study was conducted on 6-week male Wistar rats, in 3 stages: (1) 4-week adaptation to the diets (C, D or R); (2) 4-week supplementation with the same regimen enriched with 10-times more iron (CSFe, DSFe, RSFe) or iron/zinc (CSFeZn, DSFeZn, RSFeZn); (3) 2-week post-supplementation period (the same diets as the stage I). Iron and zinc content in serum, the initial segment of intestine, liver and kidney were measured using FAAS method. After supplementation period (stage II) the content of iron in the intestine, liver and kidney in groups of rats fed DSFe and DSFeZn-diet were significantly higher (all p-values≤0.05) than in rats fed D-diet (intestine: DSFe=50.1±9.0μg/g wet weight, DSFeZn=43.0±9.9μg/g vs. D=16.5±2.1μg/g; liver: DSFe=149±30μg/g, DSFeZn=152±25μg/g vs. D=56±13μg/g; kidney: DSFe=74.0±8.1μg/g, DSFeZn=72.7±6.6μg/g vs. D=59.3±9.5μg/g). The same significant associations (all p-values≤0.05) were observed in R rats in the intestine and liver (intestine: RSFe=60.8±6.6μg/g, RSFeZn=54.8±6.6μg/g vs. R=31.5±8.2μg/g; liver: RSFe=161±10μg/g, RSFeZn=166±21μg/g vs. R=136±24μg/g). After post-supplementation period the statistically significant differences between supplemented and non-supplemented rats fed D- and R-diets were still observed. There was not found the effect of applied treatments on zinc status. In conclusion, iron or iron/zinc supplementation increased similarly iron level in tissues of rats fed D-diet or R-diet with prolonged effect after supplementation discontinuation."

This paper presents three improvements to logic-based test design. First, in the context of mutation testing, we present fault hierarchies for the six relational operators. Applying the ROR mutation operator causes each relational operator to generate seven mutants per clause. The fault hierarchies show that only three of these seven mutants are needed. Second, we show how to bring the power of the ROR operator to logic-based test criteria such as the widely used Multiple Condition-Decision Coverage (MCDC) test criterion. Third, we present theoretical results supported by empirical data that show that the more recent coverage criterion of minimal-MUMCUT can find significantly more faults than MCDC. The paper has three specific recommendations: (1) Change the way the ROR mutation operator is defined in existing and future mutation systems. (2) Augment logic-based test criteria to incorporate relational operator replacement from mutation. (3) Replace the use of MCDC with minimal-MUMCUT, both in practice and in standards documents like FAA-DO178B."

Hence, improving the efficiency and predictability of airport surface operations is not only a key goal of NASA’s initiatives in Integrated Arrival/Departure/Surface (IADS) operations, but also has been recognized as a critical aspect of the FAA NextGEN implementation plan. While a number of tactical initiatives have been shown to be effective in improving airport surface operations from a service provider’s perspective, their impacts on airlines’ scheduled block time (SBT) setting, which has been found to have direct impact on airlines’ on-time performance and operating cost, have received little attention. In this paper, we assess this impact using an econometric model of airline SBT combined with a before/after analysis of the implementation of surface congestion management (SCM) at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in 2010. Since airlines do not consider gate delay in setting SBT, we find that reduction in taxi-out time variability resulting from SCM leads to more predictable taxi-out times and thus decreases in SBT. The JFK SCM implementation is used as a case study to validate model prediction performance. The observed SBT decrease between 2009 and 2011 at JFK is 4.8 min and our model predicts a 4.2 min decrease. In addition, Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) is used as an example to demonstrate how different surface operations improvements scenarios can be evaluated in terms of SBT reduction."

Three different functionalized Amberlite XAD resins were synthesized using 4-phenylthiosemicarbazide, 2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde and 2-thiophenecarboxaldehyde as reagents. These resins could be used to preconcentrate transition and other trace heavy metal analytes from nitric acid digests of soil and sediment samples. Analyte retention was shown to work well at pH 6.0. After treatment of the digests with sodium fluoride and buffering to pH 6, samples that contain extremely large concentrations of iron were analysed for trace analytes without the excess iron overloading the capacity of the resin. The analytes Cd, Co, Cu, Ni and Pb were preconcentrated from acid extracts of certified soil/sediment samples and then eluted with 0.1M HNO3 directly to the detection system. Flame atomic absorption spectrometry was used as a means of detection during the studies. The efficiency of the chelating resin and the accuracy of the proposed method were evaluated by the analysis of soil (SO-2) and sediment (LGC 6157 and MESS-3) certified reference materials."

Based on actual accidents, the authors analyzed the current requirements for protective structures in regard to operator safety aspects. The study found that the current type-approval tests do not examine phenomena related to typical accidents in underground mines, such as rock bursts resulting in thill uplift, lateral rock tosses, or cover caving. In many cases it may result in severe or fatal injuries of the mining machine operators. Thus, the authors incorporate a precise human model into operator safety tests and conducted numerical simulations by the use of the coupled Finite Element and MulitBody codes. To mitigate the injuries, the state-of-the-art seat absorber was implemented underneath a typical operator's seat. The device was designed to dissipate the kinetic energy during the process of rapid floor uplift and immediate velocity change from the cab to gallery roof impact. In order to compare the energy-dissipating capabilities of the absorber two approaches were selected for the same boundary conditions: a standard seat and seat with absorber mounted in the cab during the impact. The cab initial velocity was the main variable during the simulations. Finally, the injury criteria for the standard seat and the new approach with the energy-absorbing device were collated and contrasted."

While the enrichment step of separated Al(III) was carried out by cloud point extraction (CPE) using 8-hydroxyquinoline as complexing reagent, the resulted complex was entrapped in a non-ionic surfactant octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (Triton X-114). The enriched Al(III) in sample solutions were determined by spectrofluorometry (SPF) at λexcitation 370nm and λemission 510nm, and flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) for comparative purpose. The variables affecting the complexation and extraction steps were studied and optimized. The validity of methodology was checked with certified reference material of water and standard addition method. The enrichment factor and detection limit of Al(III) for the preconcentration of 50ml of PS and BMW were found to be 100 and 0.25μg/L, respectively. The proposed method has been applied for the determination of trace amount of Al(III) in PS and BMW samples with satisfactory results.

abstract = "Background
The link between tuberculosis (TB) and malnutrition has long been recognized. Vitamin A and zinc deficiencies may reduce the host defenses and increase the risk for diseases.
Objective
The aim of the present study was to estimate the difference in vitamin A and zinc deficiencies together with dietary intakes among pulmonary TB patients and controls.
Materials and methods
A case-control study design was employed to undertake this study in North Shewa, Ethiopia. Sputum smear examination, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to analyse acid fast bacilli (AFB), vitamin A, zinc, and C-reactive protein (CRP), respectively. Dietary intake was assessed using a 24-h recall questionnaire. Mann–Whitney U test, Kruskal–Wallis test, Chi-square, odds ratio (OR), Spearman correlation, and multinomial logistic regression model were computed for data analyses.
Results
In this study, 62 TB cases and 59 controls were included. The proportions of vitamin A deficiency among TB cases and controls were 56.4% and 39.0%, respectively. All TB cases and 92.5% controls were zinc deficient. The odds of TB cases with deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc was 2.3 (95% CI: 1.1 to 4.8)times more likely as compared to the controls. More than 80% of all participants had below average fulfilment of energy and vitamin A intakes.
Conclusion
Vitamin A and zinc deficiencies are severe problems among TB patients. Moreover, undernutrition determines the development of TB. Therefore, the management programs of TB need to address the problems of vitamin A and zinc deficiencies together with protein-energy malnutrition."

Mitochondria are crucial players in the signaling and metabolic homeostasis of the plant cell. The molecular components that orchestrate the underlying processes, however, are largely unknown. Using a chemical biology approach, we exploited the responsiveness of Arabidopsis UDP-glucosyltransferase-encoding UGT74E2 towards mitochondrial perturbation in order to look for novel mechanisms regulating mitochondria-to-nucleus communication. The most potent inducers of UGT74E2 shared a (2-furyl)acrylate (FAA) substructure that negatively affected mitochondrial function and was identified before as an auxin transcriptional inhibitor. Based on these premises, we demonstrated that perturbed mitochondria negatively affect the auxin signaling machinery. Moreover, chemical perturbation of polar auxin transport and auxin biosynthesis was sufficient to induce mitochondrial retrograde markers and their transcript abundance was constitutively elevated in the absence of the auxin transcriptional activators ARF7 and ARF19."

Morin was used as complexing ligand. Input variables of the model were pH of the solution, volume of morin, ultrasonic time and extracting solvent volume. After training using a back-propagation algorithm, the ANN model was able to predict the extraction efficiency of zinc ions. A tangent sigmoid transfer function (tansig) at hidden layer with 11 neurons and a linear transfer function (purelin) at output layer were used in the ANN model. Excellent linear regression was observed between the experimental data and the ANN predictions, showing a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9497. Using PSO method, the optimum operating conditions were determined. Under the optimum conditions, the detection limit (LOD) of the proposed procedure was calculated to be 0.8ngg−1 with a relative standard deviation (RSD%) better than 3.8% (n=10).

The metal analysis of catalysts was carried out by chemical tests and flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS). The thermal treatment of catalysts at 1500–1700°C during various processes in steel manufacturing industry converted the metals to metal oxides. The presence of CaO, MgO and ZnO in these catalysts made them highly reactive for biodiesel synthesis. The basicity of waste industrial catalysts was calculated to know their basic strength. The transesterification of U. fasciata oil was performed by fast stirring using 9:1molar ratio of methanol/oil in the presence of seven different waste industrial catalysts for 6h at 80–100°C. The solid catalysts were easily separated from product for re-use. In addition, the rate of reaction in the presence of these catalysts was found to be quite feasible. The waste brown dust from the steel converter gave the highest yield (88%) of biodiesel.

Non-volatile elements such as Mo, Zr, W and Ta were tried as coating materials. It was observed that W-coated SQT gave the best sensitivity for the determination of Bi for SQT-FAAS and SQT-AT-FAAS. The parameters for W-coated SQT-FAAS and W-coated SQT-AT-FAAS were optimized. Sensitivity of FAAS for Bi was improved as 4.0 fold by W-coated SQT-FAAS while 613 fold enhancement in sensitivity was achieved by W-coated SQT-AT-FAAS using 5.0min trapping with respect to conventional FAAS. MIBK was selected as organic solvent for the re-atomization of Bi from the trapping surface. Limit of detection values for W-coated SQT-FAAS and W-coated SQT-AT-FAAS was obtained as 0.14μgmL−1 and 0.51ngmL−1, respectively. Linear calibration plot was obtained in the range of 2.5–25.0ngmL−1 for W-coated SQT-AT-FAAS. Accuracy of the W-coated SQT-AT-FAAS system was checked by analyzing a standard reference material, NIST 1643e."

abstract = "This paper introduces the Nearly-Zero Exergy Airport (nZEXAP) concept that brings an energy, environment, and economy nexus to a common basis using the Second-Law of Thermodynamics. An nZEXAP airport has a district energy plant of its own, which receives at least 70% of the total exergy input at winter design conditions and 60% at summer design conditions, from onsite renewable energy resources and sustainable systems. These numerical criteria are consistent with the fact that especially ground heat, and solar heat have low exergy, compared to fossil fuels, and solar and wind energy applications in airports are limited. This definition is the basis of the new optimum plant design model for satisfying these new conditions with the least cost that is attributed to the cogeneration (aka CHP) system using an optimum mix of fossil and alternative fuels, such as on site-produced biogas. The main renewable exergy inputs are biogas, ground heat, building integrated or attached PV, and waste heat. Extensive use of on-site wind and roof-top or on-land type of solar applications are limited in compliance to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations against glint and glare to pilots and air traffic controllers besides potential electromagnetic hazards on avionics. The exergetic performance of the airport district plant is defined and analyzed with the use of the Rational Exergy Management Model (REMM). New exergy metrics for the performance analysis and rating of nZEXAP airports, based energy, economy, and environment nexus were also developed. The optimization problem has three primary design variables, namely the ratio of the optimum cogeneration engine capacity to the peak power load, the split of the generated power supply between the airport and the groundsource heat pumps, and the natural gas to biogas mixing ratio. The objective function solves the primary design variables by a simple search method. The new tool was applied to a conceptual study for the Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in order to compare the impact of an nZEXAP design with the ongoing deep retrofit work. Amsterdam Schiphol Airport aims to make its own activities climate neutral and to generate 10% of its own energy sustainably by 2020. In this comparison, the relative impact of the biogas share, solar input, size and performance of the ground-source heat pumps, and the power-to-heat ratio of cogeneration and absorption cooling were investigated. The results indicate that with the new optimization model, nZEXAP objectives may be satisfied, if techno-economic constraints are also satisfied. Further refinements in the definition may be needed."

Many reports have described tracheal replacement using aortic allografts, with varying results and minimal understanding of the mechanism of tracheal regeneration. The present study attempted tracheal regeneration in adult dogs using fresh aortic allografts (FAA) and cryopreserved aortic allografts (CAA).
Materials and Methods
Twelve adult beagles underwent tracheal resection and were transplanted with FAA (n = 5) or CAA (n = 7). Animals were followed-up with serial radiography and magnetic resonance imaging, and were euthanized at predetermined times up to 16 mo post-surgery.
Results
There were no procedural deaths, but two animals died due to stent migration. Stent migration occurred in seven of the 12 animals. Evidence of regeneration of tracheal epithelium was observed in the surviving animals, with the transformation of squamous metaplasia to mucociliary epithelium being time-dependent. Islet of cartilage were observed in animals after 6 mo, but ring-like cartilage structures were absent, even after 16 mo. During autopsy, axial graft contractions up to 68% were observed. Serial radiographs show that most of the contraction occurred within 1 mo. The results of the MRI showed that the graft area was strongly enhanced for up to 2 mo, but was clearly reduced after 3 mo.
Conclusions
Tracheal replacement in adult dogs using FAA or CAA is feasible. However, immaturity of the neotracheal cartilage did not allow the tissue to function as native tracheal tissue. Prolonged stenting should be considered in adult if the procedure is to be clinically contemplated."

abstract = "This paper introduces an empirically driven, non-parametric method to isolate and estimate the effects that changes in demand and changes in throughput have on delay – in particular, arrival and departure flight delay at airport runways. Classic queuing concepts were used to develop a method by which an intermediate, or counterfactual, queuing scenario could be constructed, to isolate the delay effects due to shifts in demand and throughput. This method includes the development of a stochastic throughput function that is based entirely on data and has three key features. Firstly, the function relies on non-parametric, empirically-based probability distributions of throughput counts. Secondly, facility capacity needs not be explicitly defined, as it is implicitly included in the probability distributions of throughput. Thirdly, the throughput performance function preserves the effect of factors that cause capacity (and, therefore, throughput) to fluctuate over a given period. Temporal sequences of high, moderate, and low capacity are maintained between the observed and counterfactual scenarios. The method was applied to a case study of the three major New York area airports of LaGuardia (LGA), Newark Liberty (EWR), and John F. Kennedy (JFK), using operational data extracted from the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA’s) Aviation System Performance Metrics (ASPM) database. The focus was on the peak summer travel seasons of 2006 and 2007, as these airports experienced record levels of delay in 2007. The results indicate that decreases in both demand and throughput were experienced at LGA and EWR, although the decreases in throughput had more significant effects on operational delays as they increased overall at these airports. At JFK, the increase in departure throughput was not sufficient to offset the increase in departure demands. For arrivals, demand increased and throughput decreased. These trends caused a significant growth in delay at JFK between 2006 and 2007."

We hypothesized that BO restores skin pH by regulating epidermal lactate, FFA metabolism, or FAA metabolism in EFAD. To test this hypothesis, EFAD was induced in guinea pigs by a hydrogenated coconut oil (HCO) diet for 8 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of a BO diet (group HCO + BO). As controls, groups HCO and BO were fed HCO or BO diets for 10 weeks. In group HCO + BO, skin pH, which was less acidic in group HCO, was restored; and epidermal lactate and total FFAs, including palmitate, stearate, linoleate, arachidate, behenate, and lignocerate, were higher than in group HCO. LDH and sPLA2 (mainly the PLA2G2F isoform) activities and protein expressions were similar between groups HCO + BO and BO. Epidermal acidic FAAs, as well as filaggrin and PADI3 protein and mRNA expressions were higher in group HCO + BO than in group HCO. Oleate, total FAAs including other FAAs, and LDH and sPLA2 mRNA expressions were not altered between groups HCO and HCO + BO. Basic FAAs were not altered among groups. Dietary BO restored acidic skin pH and increased epidermal levels of lactate, most FFAs, and acidic FAAs by up-regulating LDH, sPLA2, filaggrin, and PADI3 activities as well as protein or mRNA expressions in EFAD."

Increasing traffic volumes in the face of constrained resources has created peak congestion at specific locations and times in many areas of the world. Increased environmental awareness and economic drivers have combined to create a resurgent interest in ATFM as evidenced by a spate of recent ATFM conferences and workshops mediated by official bodies such as ICAO, IATA, CANSO the FAA and Eurocontrol. Significant ATFM acquisitions in the last 5 years include South Africa, Australia and India. Singapore, Thailand and Korea are all expected to procure ATFM systems within a year while China is expected to develop a bespoke system. Asia-Pacific nations are particularly pro-active given the traffic growth projections for the region (by 2050 half of all air traffic will be to, from or within the Asia-Pacific region). National authorities now have access to recently published international standards to guide the development of national and regional operational concepts for ATFM, geared to Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management and Avionics (CNS+A) evolutions. This paper critically reviews the field to determine which ATFM research and development efforts hold the best promise for practical technological implementations, offering clear benefits both in terms of enhanced safety and efficiency in times of growing air traffic. An evolutionary approach is adopted starting from an ontology of current ATFM techniques and proceeding to identify the technological and regulatory evolutions required in the future CNS+A context, as the aviation industry moves forward with a clearer understanding of emerging operational needs, the geo-political realities of regional collaboration and the impending needs of global harmonisation."

abstract = "Background
Is there a “killing zone” (Craig, 2001)—a range of pilot flight time over which general aviation (GA) pilots are at greatest risk? More broadly, can we predict accident rates, given a pilot's total flight hours (TFH)? These questions interest pilots, aviation policy makers, insurance underwriters, and researchers alike. Most GA research studies implicitly assume that accident rates are linearly related to TFH, but that relation may actually be multiply nonlinear. This work explores the ability of serial nonlinear modeling functions to predict GA accident rates from noisy rate data binned by TFH.
Method
Two sets of National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)/Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) data were log-transformed, then curve-fit to a gamma-pdf-based function. Despite high rate-noise, this produced weighted goodness-of-fit (Rw2) estimates of .654 and .775 for non-instrument-rated (non-IR) and instrument-rated pilots (IR) respectively.
Conclusion
Serial-nonlinear models could be useful to directly predict GA accident rates from TFH, and as an independent variable or covariate to control for flight risk during data analysis. Applied to FAA data, these models imply that the “killing zone” may be broader than imagined. Relatively high risk for an individual pilot may extend well beyond the 2000-h mark before leveling off to a baseline rate."

The results showed that the concentrations of total free amino acids (FAAs), umami 5′-nucleotide compounds and poly-unsaturated fatty acids in the hepatopancreas and muscle of pond-produced crab were significantly lower than those of lake-produced crabs. The carotenoid concentrations in the shell and hepatopancreas of pond-produced crabs were significantly lower than those of lake-produced crabs. Significant differences were also observed in terms of shell color, hepatopancreas color and the taste of and preference for the hepatopancreas through sensory evaluation. However, no difference was detected in the taste of muscle. No unpleasant odors or tastes were detected in the muscle or hepatopancreas in either group of crabs. A significantly lower concentration of chlorophyll-a, higher DO and pH values, and poorer biodiversity of microalgae were observed in the pond water compared with lake water; however, no difference in the concentrations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus were detected. It is speculated that the low biodiversity of microalgae and flourishing macrophytes in the ponds contributed directly or indirectly to the faint color as well as the flavor of Chinese mitten crab."

The influence of the availability of free amino acids (FAAs) on BA formation during the fermentation of som-fug with and without starter culture was also investigated. The significant differences in the amount of some FAAs among batches would be partially attributed to the distinct proteolytic and BAs accumulation of specific microbiota of each batch. In general, amounts of FAA were related with their corresponding BAs. In batch control of the availability of practically all FAA precursors, BA formation could be observed. The formation of some BAs (histamine, putrescine, cadaverine, and phenylethylamine) occurring in batch control was related to the amounts of FAA precursors (histidine, arginine, lysine, and phenylalanine).

Thus, flame-atomic absorption spectrometry was used to determine the concentrations of Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Na, K, Ca and Mg in 74 samples of synovial fluids taken from 36 patients. Prior to analysis, the samples of synovial fluids were centrifuged and obtained supernatants were digested by microwave technique. It was found that the level of investigated essential elements was differentiated in patients suffering with OA. High correlation between Zn and K, Na and K, as well as Cu and Mn were revealed. Based on cluster analysis, synovial fluids of patients treated with Diprophos, Euflexxa and Synocrom, can be found almost in all clusters. ANOVA has shown that there is a significant difference between Na level in synovial fluids of patients treated with antirheumatic drugs, and those who were not treated. For the patients treated with Euflexxa, similar relations for Ca and K exist. Principal component analysis has shown that essential elements responsible for variability within studied samples, are Ca, Mg, Cu, Mn and Fe.

The theory begins by introducing the pseudo-composite function g(af(x)), where a is arbitrary and the functions g(x) and f(x) are expressed as general power series expansions that are referred to as the outer and inner series, respectively. Then Theorem 4.1 presents general expressions for the coefficients of the resulting power series expansion for both the quotient of pseudo-composite functions and its inverted form in terms of sums over partitions. Next it is shown that Faà di Bruno's formula or the Bell polynomial approach represents a special case of the partition method for a power series expansion. To demonstrate both the generality and versatility of the partition method for a power series expansion, Theorem 4.1 is used to determine the power series expansion for the function f(z)=exp⁡(azνsinρ⁡z). If the quotient of the pseudo-composite functions in Theorem 4.1 is smooth, then the coefficients of its Taylor/Maclaurin series can also be expressed in terms of a sum over the partitions. In a second corollary the theory is extended by taking an arbitrary power ρ of the quotient of the pseudo-composite functions of Theorem 4.1. The chapter concludes by deriving the power series expansion for the exponentiated function of the second corollary to Theorem 4.1."

abstract = "High-resolution continuum source flame atomic absorption spectrometry (HR-CS FAAS) was applied to reveal and investigate spectral interference in the determination of Si. An intensive structured background was observed in the analysis of both aqueous and xylene solutions containing S compounds. This background was attributed to absorption by the CS molecule formed in the N2O–C2H2 flame. The lines of the CS spectrum at least partially overlap all five of the most sensitive Si lines investigated. The 251.611nm Si line was demonstrated to be the most advantageous. The intensity of the structured background caused by the CS molecule significantly depends on the chemical form of S in the solution and is the highest for the most-volatile CS2. The presence of O atoms in an initial S molecule can diminish the formation of CS. To overcome this S effect, various modes of baseline fitting and background correction were evaluated, including iterative background correction (IBC) and utilization of correction pixels (WRC). These modes were used either independently or in conjunction with least squares background correction (LSBC). The IBC+LSBC mode can correct the extremely strong interference caused by CS2 at an S concentration of 5% w:w in the investigated solution. However, the efficiency of this mode depends on the similarity of the processed spectra and the correction spectra in terms of intensity and in additional effects, such as a sloping baseline. In the vicinity of the Si line, three lines of V were recorded. These lines are well-separated in the HR-CS FAAS spectrum, but they could be a potential source of overcorrection when using line source flame atomic absorption spectrometry (LS FAAS). The expected signal for the 251.625nm Fe line was not registered at 200mgL−1 Fe concentration in the solution, probably due to the diminished population of Fe atoms in the high-temperature flame used. The observations made using HR-CS FAAS helped to establish a “safe” level of the matrix components S, V, and Fe in the determination of Si using both HR-CS FAAS and LS FAAS. Under the best conditions, the instrumental detection limits for LS FAAS and for HR-CS FAAS, as well as the characteristic concentration values, were similar. Unusual calibration curves were observed in HR-CS FAAS. The curves showed an inflexion point that divided them into two linear parts with distinctly different slopes."

abstract = "High-resolution continuum source and line source flame atomic absorption spectrometry (HR-CS FAAS and LS FAAS, respectively) were applied for Pb determination in unleaded aviation or automotive gasoline that was dissolved in methyl-isobutyl ketone. When using HR-CS FAAS, a structured background (BG) was registered in the vicinity of both the 217.001nm and 283.306nm Pb lines. In the first case, the BG, which could be attributed to absorption by the OH molecule, directly overlaps with the 217nm line, but it is of relatively low intensity. For the 283nm line, the structured BG occurs due to uncompensated absorption by OH molecules present in the flame. BG lines of relatively high intensity are situated at a large distance from the 283nm line, which enables accurate analysis, not only when using simple variants of HR-CS FAAS but also for LS FAAS with a bandpass of 0.1nm. The lines of the structured spectrum at 283nm can have “absorption” (maxima) or “emission” (minima) character. The intensity of the OH spectra can significantly depend on the flame character and composition of the investigated organic solution. The best detection limit for the analytical procedure, which was 0.01mgL−1 for Pb in the investigated solution, could be achieved using HR-CS FAAS with the 283nm Pb line, 5pixels for the analyte line measurement and iterative background correction (IBC). In this case, least squares background correction (LSBC) is not recommended. However, LSBC (available as the “permanent structures” option) would be recommended when using the 217nm Pb line. In LS FAAS, an additional phenomenon related to the nature of the organic matrix (for example, isooctane or toluene) can play an important role. The effect is of continuous character and probably due to the simultaneous efficient correction of the continuous background (IBC) it is not observed in HR-CS FAAS. The fact that the effect does not depend on the flame character indicates that it is not radiation scattering. For LS FAAS, the determination of Pb using the 283nm line, a 0.1nm bandpass and a fuel lean flame is strongly recommended. The analysis of certified reference materials, recovery studies and the analysis of real samples with low Pb content supported the satisfactory accuracy of Pb determination in automotive or aviation gasoline when the recommended analytical variants are applied. The studies in this work shed new light on spectral phenomena in air-acetylene flames. The structured background due to absorption by the OH molecules must be taken into account during Pb determination in other materials as well as in some other elemental determinations, especially at low absorbance levels. The usefulness of HR-CS FAAS for revealing and investigating a structured background was demonstrated. HR-CS FAAS does not reveal fully corrected spectral effects with a continuous character, which can be found in LS FAAS."

To achieve the most effective bioleaching of Zn, Cr, Ni, Cu, Mn, Fe the usage of both autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria in sequence, combined with flushing of the residue after bioleaching is required. 80–100% of total metal concentrations were mobilized after the proposed treatment.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) poses unprecedented changes in the roles and responsibilities traditionally held by pilots and air traffic controllers dating back to the late 1920s when Archie League served as one of the first flagmen at the St. Louis, Missouri, airfield. These changes are being enabled by implementation of new technologies, concepts, and procedures. The goals driving these changes are to improve capacity of the National Airspace System (NAS) and reduce flight delays while maintaining the strong safety record of civil aviation. Human factors has a great opportunity to contribute to and fashion these changes to ensure that pilots and controllers can perform their tasks within the envelope of effective and efficient human performance in a manner conducive to accruing these benefits intended with NextGen. One of several important human factors challenges is that as a system becomes more tightly coupled to ensure efficiencies, the less time there is available to respond to non-normal situations. NextGen will provide operational improvements changing the jobs of pilots and air traffic controllers. Concepts for the mid- and far-term will introduce changes to the roles and responsibilities between pilots and controllers such as in relation to delegation of separation responsibility as pilots use satellite-based surveillance information shown on a cockpit display of traffic information (CDTI). New technologies will enable changes in the allocation of functions between humans and automation so that controllers can shift toward more strategic handling additional aircraft while pilots are delegated certain tactical responsibilities."

As of today most of the internet IP traffic is already transmitted in this format and still it is said to double in volume till 2014. Most p2p systems, however, are not pure serverless solutions, nor is the searching in those networks highly efficient, usually achieved by simple flooding. In order to confront with the growing traffic we must consider more elaborate search mechanisms and far less centralized environments. An effective proposal to this problem is to solve it in the domain of ant colony optimization metaheuristics. In this paper we present an overview of ACO algorithms that offer the best potential in this field, under the strict requirements and limitations of a pure p2p network. We design several experiments to serve as an evaluation platform for the mentioned algorithms to conclude the features of a high quality approach. Finally, we consider two hybrid extensions to the classical algorithms, in order to examine their contribution to the overall quality robustness."

Escherichia coli DH5α (pNV12) was tested for its response in the presence of different combinations of Pb(II), Cd(II) and Zn(II) ions. The investigation resulted in the development of a cadmium specific recombinant whole cell biosensor with a response time as low as 15min. A good linear range for cadmium ion concentrations of 10–50μg/l with R2 0.9946 was obtained and the detection limit of 10μg/l. Further, we reduced the detection limit up to 5μg/l by increasing the incubation time from 15 to 30min. High throughput microarray techniques for testing of 48 samples simultaneously has also been developed with reaction volume miniaturized from 2000μl to 200μl. The developed biosensor was applied to detect cadmium ion concentration in milk samples collected from different areas of Punjab, India.

We report here the differences in diets acceptance, fish growth and diet utilization in silver bream in comparison to other cyprinid fishes. We specifically address the response in free amino acids in the body to dietary treatments. Experimental diets included: a commercial Aglo Norse feed, casein-gelatin based diet (CG), free amino acid mixture diet (FAA), dipeptide (PP), dipeptide-protein (PP50) based diet, and dipeptide diet without arginine (NoArg). In addition, live Artemia were offered to 3 groups and “fasting” control treatment was included during 3 week long trial. Fish offered Artemia overperformed those offered formulated diets both in terms of mass (80.7±26.3 mg) and survival (97.2%). We also indicate that commercial and purified diets are comparable as the first/exclusive feed for growth and survival of silver bream. Our experiment also showed that the whole body free amino acid concentrations of 9 indispensable amino acids (IDAA) out of 10 (His, Thr, Arg, Val, Met, Ile, Leu, Trp, Lys) in the PP50 group was the highest among 7 diet treatments and the totalfree amino acid concentration, total dispensable amino acids (DAA) and total IDAA of the PP50 diet fed fish showed the same trend. This may indicate that diets based on 50% of dipeptides and 50% of protein are adequate for silver bream larvae as they result in similar growth, survival and whole body IDAA concentrations as in fish fed CG (protein-based) diet fed fish."

abstract = "In December 2014, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) completed a major revision of the rules and regulations governing flight and duty time in commercial aviation (Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 117). Scientists were included in the revision process and provided insights into sleep, sleep loss, the circadian rhythm, and their effects on performance that were incorporated into the new rule. If a planned flight was non-compliant with the regulation, for example if it exceeded flight and duty time limits, it could only be flown under an FAA-approved Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS) as meeting an Alternative Method of Compliance (AMOC). One method that a flight could qualify as an AMOC is if it could be demonstrated empirically that it was as safe as or safer than a similar flight, designated the Safety Standard Operation (SSO), that was compliant with the regulation. In the present paper, we demonstrate the FRMS process using a comparison between a non-compliant AMOC flight from the US west coast to Australia and a compliant SSO flight from the US west coast to Taiwan. The AMOC was non-compliant because it exceeded the flight time limits in the prescriptive rule. Once a data collection exemption was granted by the FAA, both the outbound and inbound AMOC and SSO routes were studied on four Safety Performance Indicators (SPIs). The SPIs studied were inflight sleep, cognitive performance, self-reported fatigue, and self-reported sleepiness. These measures were made at top of descent (TOD), a critical phase of flight. The study was designed as a paired comparison. Forty volunteer pilots studied flew both the AMOC and the SSO flights for a total of 80 studied flights. Using statistical non-inferiority applied to the AMOC and SSO SPIs, we demonstrated, as required by the new rule, that the US-Australia AMOC flight was “as safe as, or safer than” the US-Taiwan SSO flight. In the context of FRMS, statistical non-inferiority is a concept and technique of great utility, straightforward in application, producing clear visual representations of the findings, and providing a direct answer to the question posed by the regulation - is the AMOC flight as safe as, or safer than” the SSO."

Cultures were maintained at 27°C, salinity 35, 110μmolm−2s−1 (12h:12h light:dark cycle) on L2 medium at an initial nitrogen concentration of 50μMN. Toxicity was determined using a ouabain/veratridine-dependent cytotoxicity assay (N2A assay) standardized to a ciguatoxin standard. Nitrate, ammonium, FAA, and putrescine supported growth, but urea did not. The appearance of ammonium in the organic nitrogen cultures indicated that G. toxicus and/or associated bacteria remineralized the available organic nitrogen. Both strains were exposed to nitrogen-limiting conditions as evidenced by chlorophyll a content per cell, nitrogen content, and nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) (N:P) ratio significantly declining once nitrogen was no longer available in the medium and cells entered stationary phase. Strain 1651 grew significantly faster than strain 1655 when nitrate, FAA, and putrescine was the nitrogen source, but not ammonium. Nitrogen source had no effect on growth rate (∼0.14d−1) in strain 1651. The growth rate of strain 1655 (0.10–0.13d−1) was significantly faster on ammonium than the other nitrogen sources. Strain 1655 was significantly more toxic (∼10-fold) than strain 1651 except when growing on ammonium at exponential phase. Toxicity ranged from 1.3 to 8.7fgC-CTX1-Eqcell−1 in strain 1651 and from 30.7 to 54.3fgC-CTX1-Eqcell−1 in strain 1655. Nitrogen source had no significant affect on toxicity. Toxicity was greater in stationary versus exponential phase cells for strain 1651 when grown on nitrate and strain 1655 regardless of nitrogen source. The difference in toxicity between growth phases may result from an increase in ciguatoxin and/or maitotoxin. Our results suggest that some strains of G. toxicus when associated with bacteria are able to take advantage of organic as well as inorganic nitrogen sources on short time scales to support future growth. The uncoupling of total nitrogen and phosphorus pools from conditions in the water column suggest that instantaneous growth rates can be supported by nutrients acquired hours to days earlier."

The significant differences in the content of some FAA among batches would be partially attributed to the distinct proteolytic and aminogenic capability of specific microbiota of each batch. In general, contents of FAA were inversely related with their corresponding BA. In batches C and LS, despite the availability of practically all FAA precursors, it could not be observed a BA formation due to the weak or lack aminogenic capability of indigenous microbiota or L. sakei CTC494, respectively. In contrast, the formation of some BA (tyramine, cadaverine and phenylethylamine) occurring in batch LC, was inversely related to the contents of their FAA precursors (tyrosine, lysine and phenylalanine). The availability of FAA in dry fermented sausages might become a limiting factor for a decarboxylase-positive microbiota, in three different circumstances: a) the lack of release of phenylalanine in batch fermented by the indigenous microbiota, b) the inability of L. curvatus CTC273 to transform arginine into ornithine for putrescine formation, and c) the depletion of tyrosine and phenylalanine during the fermentation and ripening process, because it is used as a substrate of different metabolic reactions, including decarboxylation by L. curvatus CTC273."

abstract = "Background
Previous studies have combined anastomotic, catheter-induced, and atherosclerotic isolated femoral artery aneurysms (FAAs) to achieve adequate numbers for analysis and have recommended repair of asymptomatic FAAs with diameters ≥2.5 cm and all symptomatic FAAs. This study evaluated the contemporary management of isolated FAAs.
Methods
Patients with FAAs were evaluated using a standardized, prospectively maintained database by a research consortium.
Results
From 2002 to 2012, 236 FAAs were identified in 182 patients (mean age, 72 years; male-to-female ratio, 16:1) at eight institutions. The mean nonoperative mean diameter was 2.8 ± 0.7 cm, and the operative diameter was 3.3 ± 1.5 cm. FAA location was the common femoral artery in 191, superficial femoral artery (SFA) in 34, and profunda femoris artery in 11. Synchronous aneurysms (mean, 1.7 per patient) occurred in the aorta (n = 113), in the iliac (n = 109), popliteal (n = 86), and hypogastric (n = 56) arteries, and in the contralateral common femoral artery (n = 34), SFA (n = 9), and profunda femoris artery (n = 2). Of the aneurysms repaired, 66% were asymptomatic; other indications for repair were claudication (18%), local pain (8%), nerve compression (3%), rupture (2%), acute thrombosis (1%), and rest pain (0.5%). Acute aneurysm-related complications (rupture, thrombosis, embolus) were associated (P < .05) with FAA diameter >4 cm and intraluminal thrombus, but not location. Mean diameter of asymptomatic aneurysms that developed acute complications was 5.7 ± 1.3 cm for rupture, 4 ± 1.1 cm for thrombosis, and 3.5 cm for embolus. Repair was by interposition or bypass graft in 177 FAAs and by endovascular repair in three SFA aneurysms. Two perioperative deaths, of myocardial infarction and multisystem organ failure, occurred at 30 days. Operative complications included wound infection (6%), seroma (3%), and bleeding (2%). No amputations occurred through 5 years in the operative or nonoperative groups. Survival in operated-on patients was 99% (n = 138) at 3 months, 92% at 1 year, and 81% (n = 20) at 5 years.
Conclusions
This largest study of isolated FAAs demonstrates that (1) acute complications did not occur in FAAs ≤3.5 cm, repair criteria of asymptomatic FAAs should be changed to >3.5 cm, and chronic intraluminal thrombus should reduce the threshold for repair, and that (2) current indications for symptomatic FAA repair result in low morbidity and should remain unchanged."

The installation of a Horizontal Permeable Reactive Barrier (H-PRB) could constitute a tertiary treatment process to remove EOCs from treated domestic wastewater prior to recharge activities. The sorption-desorption behaviour of six neutral EOCs present in treated domestic wastewater (acetaminophen, caffeine, carbamazepine, cotinine, 4-acetamidoantipyrine (4-AAA) and 4-formylaminoantipyrine (4-FAA)) has been evaluated. Clinoptilolite and palygorskite have been studied as sorbents to be installed in the H-PRB. Batch tests were carried out using an EOC initial concentration ranging from 5 to 100 μg L−1. Apart from acetaminophen and caffeine, both materials showed a limited sorption capacity of neutral EOCs (Kd = 0.63–5.42 L kg−1). In general, the experimental results show that EOCs exhibit a higher sorption affinity for clinoptilolite than for palygorskite. With the exception of carbamazepine, the sorption of the compounds occurs mainly by interactions with mineral surfaces as indicated by the comparison of the partition coefficients into organic matter and into mineral surfaces. According to the molecular geometry of the compounds and the sorption sequences observed, it appears that the dimensions of the organic molecules play a key role in the sorption process. All the studied EOCs exhibit irreversible sorption and sorption-desorption hysteresis."

Cultivars Ida, Koralle, Linnea, Sanna, and Sussi were grown in Oregon, USA, and had only been evaluated previously for their horticultural traits. All five cultivars contained the three anticipated anthocyanins (by HPLC): cyanidin-3-galactoside (main anthocyanin found in these berries), cyanidin-3-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-arabinoside. These lingonberries’ total anthocyanin content ranged from 27.4 (‘Linnea’) to 52.6 (‘Ida’)mg/100g fw. They contained 22 free amino acids (FFAs) and total FAAs ranged from 28.92 (‘Sanna’) to 70.38 (‘Koralle’)mg/100g fw. Asparagine (ASN) was the leading FAA (22–34% of the total FAAs) for all five cultivars. This is the first report on lingonberry FAA content."

Proteases supplementation significantly improved the extract yield and FAA level of mashed worts. Normal gravity worts treated with Flavorzyme and Neutrase exhibited higher fermentability, ethanol production and flavor volatiles concentration compared to the control worts, while these beneficial effects were observed in high gravity worts treated with Protamex and Neutrase. The reason for the above results is proposed to be the change in the assimilation pattern of FAA in lager yeast with increased wort gravity, especially for the improved assimilation ratios of Leu, Arg, Phe, His, Asp and Val. In normal gravity fermentations, there were strong correlations between the assimilation amounts of Lys, Leu, Arg and His and fermentability, while in high gravity fermentations, these good correlations were found with only Lys and His. The present study suggested that optimizing the composition of FAA by supplementing proteases during wort mashing was beneficial to beer brewing for improving fermentation performance of lager yeast and flavor volatiles formation."

The method was based on the formation of water-in-oil emulsion by mixing 2.0mL of extraction solution constituted by 12% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 5% (v/v) HNO3 with 10mL of sample. After heating at 90°C for 10min, two well-defined phases were formed. The bottom phase (approximately 3.5mL), composed of acidified water and part of the ethanol originally present in the gasoline sample, containing the extracted analytes was analyzed. The surfactant and HNO3 concentrations and the heating temperature employed in the process were optimized by Doehlert design, using a Brazilian gasoline sample spiked with Cu, Fe and Pb (organometallic compounds). The efficiency of extraction was investigated and it ranged from 80 to 89%. The calibration was accomplished by using matrix matching method. For this, the standards were obtained performing the same extraction procedure used for the sample, using emulsions obtained with a gasoline sample free of analytes and the addition of inorganic standards. Limits of detection obtained were 3.0, 5.0 and 14.0μgL−1 for Cu, Fe and Pb, respectively. These limits were estimated for the original sample taking into account the preconcentration factor obtained. The accuracy of the proposed method was assured by recovery tests spiking the samples with organometallic standards and the obtained values ranged from 98 to 105%. Ten gasoline samples were analyzed and Fe was found in four samples (0.04–0.35mgL−1) while Cu (0.28mgL−1) and Pb (0.60mgL−1) was found in just one sample."

When using FaaS offerings, such as AWS Lambda, developers provide atomic and short-running code for their functions, and FaaS providers execute and horizontally scale them on-demand. Currently, there is no systematic research on how developers use serverless, what types of applications lend themselves to this model, or what architectural styles and practices FaaS-based applications are based on. We present results from a mixed-method study, combining interviews with practitioners who develop applications and systems that use FaaS, a systematic analysis of grey literature, and a Web-based survey. We find that successfully adopting FaaS requires a different mental model, where systems are primarily constructed by composing pre-existing services, with FaaS often acting as the “glue” that brings these services together. Tooling availability and maturity, especially related to testing and deployment, remains a major difficulty. Further, we find that current FaaS systems lack systematic support for function reuse, and abstractions and programming models for building non-trivial FaaS applications are limited. We conclude with a discussion of implications for FaaS providers, software developers, and researchers."

The manganese ions are complexed in a mixture of the reagent 2-[2′-(6-methyl-benzothiazolylazo)]-4-bromophenol (Me-BTABr) and Triton X-114. The components are retained on a minicolumn and then desorbed with eluent acid to subsequent detection of manganese by FAAS. Under the optimized conditions, the method presented a detection limit of 0.7μgL−1 and an enrichment factor of 17 to a volume of 3000μL. The sampling frequency was 30h−1. The accuracy of the method was tested by evaluating the amount of Mn in certified reference materials (apple leaves NIST 1515 and spinach leaves NIST 1570a). The proposed procedure was applied to food samples (shrimp powder, flaxseed flour, wheat flour, soy flour and oat), and the results agreed with those obtained by the determination of Mn in foods by atomic absorption spectrometry with electrothermal atomization (ETAAS)."

An investigation of the variables that influence the preconcentration, such as pH, temperature, sonication time, amount of reagents and cooling time, was carried out. After optimization of these variables, the developed method yielded a preconcentration factor of 40, precision of 1.5% (5.0 μg L−1), and limit of detection of 0.10 μg L−1. The accuracy of the method was evaluated by an analysis of the following certified reference materials: mussel tissue (ERM-CE 278), aquatic plant (Lagarosiphon major, BCR-060), and plankton (BCR-414). The procedure was then applied for the determination of Cd in mussel samples, which was found to vary from 0.837 to 1.150 μg g−1. The reported method is simple, fast, efficient, and easy to perform, and represents an interesting alternative for the determination of cadmium."

A comparison of the launch success between civil and commercial launches is used to inform the decision on whether or not mission success would be an appropriate regulatory stance for the FAA-AST. The results show that there is no significant difference in launch success between civil and commercial ELV launches.

Armed with toxicological data, compendial and regulatory agencies have revisited traditional approaches to the testing of pharmaceuticals for metals and metalloids, and analysts have begun to employ the techniques of atomic spectroscopy, such as flame- and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS, Flame AA or FAA and GFAAS), inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), to meet their analytical needs. Newer techniques, such as laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and Laser Ablation ICP-MS (LAICP–MS) are also beginning to see wider applications in the analysis of elements in the pharmaceutical industry.This article will provide a perspective regarding the various applications of atomic spectroscopy in the analysis of metals and metalloids in drug products, active pharmaceutical ingredients (API's), raw materials and intermediates.

abstract = "Sixteen sourdoughs (FS1–FS16) used for the manufacture of traditional French breads were characterized by strongly acid conditions (median value of pH3.5). The concentration of free amino acids (FAA) was highly variable, due to different proteolytic activity of flour used for back slopping and of dominant microorganisms. Median value of cell density of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was 9.2logCFU/g. The ratio between LAB and yeasts ranged from 10,000:1 to 10:1. According to the culture-dependent method and 16S metagenetics, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis was the dominant species in French sourdoughs. FS5 and FS15, propagated according to protocols including one back slopping step at 14°C, were the only exceptions. High positive correlations were found between L. sanfranciscensis, temperature of back slopping and FAA. The results of this study highlighted the broad adaptability of L. sanfranciscensis to very acid sourdough. Besides species frequently encountered (e.g., Lactobacillus parabrevis/Lactobacillus hammesii, Lactobacillus plantarum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides), first Lactobacillus xiangfangensis (FS5) and Lactobacillus diolivorans (FS15) were found in sourdough. As determined by RAPD-PCR analyses, the sourdough samples showed a different number of strains, ranging from 5 (FS9, FS11 and FS15) to 12 (FS1 and FS13), meaning a highly variable bacterial diversity. Cluster analysis showed that different sourdoughs, especially when propagated in the same bakery, may harbor similar strains. Except for L. plantarum (FS5) and Ln. mesenteroides (FS3), all the dominant species were detected by both 16S metagenetics and culture-dependent method. Yeast diversity was lower than LAB. Except for FS4 (solely dominated by Kazachstania servazzii), yeast microbiota of French sourdoughs was dominated by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Strains isolated in this study could be a useful base for developing new basic researches on physiology, metabolism, and intraspecific diversity of L. sanfranciscensis, as well as for standardizing the quality of traditional French breads."

abstract = "For almost 150 years, the two monotypic genera Trochodendron and Tetracentron (Trochodendraceae) have been considered to share an unusual and primitive feature in angiosperms – the lack of vessels in their wood. Therefore, they have been classified in a basal position in the angiosperms. Our observations by light microscopy, low-vacuum environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and high-vacuum scanning electron microscopy (SEM) both in fresh and FAA-fixed materials consistently showed the presence of tracheary elements differentiated into two types in both genera. In Trochodendron, the tracheary elements can be divided into perforate vessel elements and imperforate fiber-tracheids and tracheids. The vessel elements show end and lateral walls. The pits on the end walls are elongate- broadened and do not have membranes or only a few remnants of them forming the perforation plates. The fiber-tracheids show crossfield pit pairs and sharp ends, and the tracheids show bordered pits. In Tetracentron, the tracheary elements comprise vessel elements and fibers. The vessel elements are similar to those of Trochodendron, whereas the fibers have no crossfield pit pairs but, rather, elliptical pits and sharp ends. Thus, both Trochodendron and Tetracentron are vessel bearing rather than vesselless, although their vessel elements are primitive."

The object of this study was to determine the soil water content criteria at which growth and yield production of muskmelon would be optimal based on soil water measured by Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) inside a plastic greenhouse when using drip irrigation. Four soil water content lest thresholds (relative to the percentage of field water capacity) for starting the irrigation (45%-I45, 55%-I55, 65%-I65, 75%-I75) were compared inside plastic greenhouse experiment in 2009. Amount of applied irrigation water for four treatments varied from 120.1 to 178.6mm. The results showed that muskmelon plant development, fruit production and quality were significantly affected under different irrigation water amounts. Higher soil water content enhanced vegetative growth through increasing the plant height and stem diameter. Variation in soil water content not only had effects on fruit size, but also had effects on fruit yield. The highest fruit yield and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) were obtained from the treatment employing the greatest irrigation thresholds and quantity of irrigation (I75). When the thresholds of soil water content were below 65% field water capacity during the whole growth period, the mean fruit weight and yield decreased significantly. Irrigation water amount significantly affected the flesh thickness and fruit total soluble solids (TTS), soluble sugar (SS), vitamin C (Vc), soluble protein (SP) and free amino acid (FAA) content. In conclusion, treatment I75 was the optimum irrigation schedule for muskmelon grown inside plastic greenhouse."

For analysis, a conception of restriction boundary of regulation is introduced and the influence produced by each revised reason is researched between restriction boundary and safety boundary. Results show that the changed of Part 33 has four cycles, with significant revision every 10-12 years. And interestingly, the civil high bypass ratio turbofan engine has the same development stages and good corresponding relationship with significant revision period of Part 33. Under the contradiction between safety demand of FAA and technology demand of manufacturer, the revised reason of regulation is generalized into five aspects: the development of technology, the hazardous accident, the overly strict rules or vice versa, the unclear definition or explanation, the international uniformity. Therefore, the appeared new aircraft engine can promote the update of regulations and the revised regulations guide the development of next generation engine. Basing on these obtained laws, the next significance amendment of airworthiness regulation Part 33 can be predicated."

In this study, FAA analysis is applied to 30 patients of partial TLE (15 left, 15 right) and 14 matched normal controls. Specifically, after registering all the images with the JHU-DTI-MNI template the average FA value of each FA skeleton section is calculated using the tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) method. Then, FAA is calculated to quantify the WM diffusivity asymmetry of the corresponding region-pairs between the left and right hemispheres. Using FAA the regional asymmetry contributing significantly to the group differences of controls and left/right TLE, as well as the left and right TLE, is identified. As a comparison, the ROI-based average FA values for WM and corresponding FAAs are also calculated. TBSS-based analysis reflects the average of local maximal FA values along the white matter skeleton sections, and ROI-based analysis shows the average of WM FA values within each anatomical region. The FAA statistical results indicated that the FA values of anatomical region-pairs are asymmetric in the ipsilateral hemisphere with seizure origin against the contralateral hemisphere. Particularly, FAA values within the temporal lobe (superior, middle, and inferior temporal WM) are significantly different between the left and right TLE patients, consistently found from both analysis methods. The study suggests that FAA values can be potentially used to identify the seizures of origin of TLE and to help understand the relationship between fiber tracts with the side of seizure origin of TLE."

Although RF impacts various hormones, sex-related differences in FAA are unclear. 'Here, we report significantly more food-anticipatory wheel-running activity in male than in female mice during RF. In parallel with the sex-related difference in FAA, male and female mice display different food intake and body weight in response to RF. Since gonadal hormones could be involved in the sex-specific difference in FAA, we compared sham and gonadectomized male and female wild-type mice. In gonadectomized mice, the sex difference in FAA was abolished, indicating a role for gonadal hormones in FAA. Further, plasma concentrations of the hormone ghrelin were higher in female than in male mice during ad libitum (AL) feeding, and RF induced a temporal advance in its peak in both sexes. RF also shifted the expression peak of the circadian gene mPer1 in the hippocampus and liver, although no sex difference was found in either the level or the cyclic phase of its expression. Per1Brdm1 mutant mice were still sexually dimorphic for FAA, but diminished FAA was noted in both male and female Per2Brdm1 mutant mice. In summary, our results imply that gonadal hormones contribute to the sex difference in FAA, possibly through modulating ghrelin activity."

The surface area, pore volume and micropore size of the sorbent were found to be 232m2g−1, 0.0303cm3g−1 and 1.7nm, respectively. To accomplish the on-line sorbent preconcentration, 20.0mL of a pH 9.0 Cd(II) solution at a flow rate of 10.0mLmin−1 were preconcentrated onto 320mg of the SiO2/MnOx material packed into a mini-column and then eluted with 1.0molL−1 HNO3 toward the FAAS detector. The following analytical features were obtained: linear responses to Cd(II) ions in the range of 1.0–50.0μgL−1 (r=0.9968), detection limit of 0.20μgL−1, preconcentration factor of 39.4, concentration efficiency of 19.7min−1, consumptive index of 0.51mL, and analytical frequency of 20h−1. The dispersion of manganese oxide in the SiO2 matrix promoted a 2.15-fold improvement on detectability of Cd(II) ions in comparison with an analytical curve built with SiO2 as sorbent. The accuracy of the preconcentration method was verified through the analysis of natural water samples employing addition/recovery tests and GF AAS as reference technique, and analysis of certified reference materials — Lobster Hepatopancreas (TORT-2) and NIST SRM 1643e (“Trace elements in natural waters”)."

Results showed that the average contents of FAA and TAA in fresh royal jelly were 9.21mg/g and 111.27mg/g, respectively; the major FAAs were Pro, Gln, Lys, Glu, and the most abundant TAAs were Asp, Glu, Lys and Leu.

After specific loading cycles, the skid-resistance of asphalt mix slabs was measured using the Sand Patch Test and the British Pendulum Number (BPN) Test. Sand Patch testing mainly explores the macro-texture of the pavement, while BPN test mostly investigates the micro-texture of the pavement. The test results show FAA has a significant impact on skid-resistance on the macro-texture level but an only marginal influence was observed on the micro-texture level. The correlation between FAA and skid-resistance is validated using a Forward Selection method. Outcomes of this experimental study can potentially be adopted by both practitioners and researchers."

abstract = "Live foods used in a marine fish hatchery must provide the nutrients needed for the rapidly developing larvae. Marine pelagic fish eggs can contain up to 50% of their total amino acid pool as free amino acids (FAA), of which most is used up shortly after the onset of exogenous feeding as a source of energy. Copepod nauplii are richer in FAA than many traditional foods given to marine fish larvae. However, copepod nauplii can be difficult to produce in mass quantities in the hatchery and are more readily available by capture from the wild. The process of capture and acclimation may impact the nutrient quality of such nauplii. This study describes the FAA profile of nauplii of Apocyclops panamensis collected from low salinity fertilized brackish-water ponds, the effects of acclimation from 6.6‰ to 30‰ seawater on the FAA profile, and the feasibility of direct enrichment of nauplii with isoleucine, leucine, lysine and valine. Nauplii were exposed to four treatment protocols over a 3h period and sampled for FAA profiles, 1) no salinity change, 2) direct transfer to 30‰, 3) acclimated to 30‰, and 4) acclimated+FAA enrichment. Nauplii collected from 6.6‰ salinity ponds had a mean total FAA content of 27.22±5.85nmol·mg−1 w.w. nauplii at the time of collection. Forty-two percent of the total was comprised of essential amino acids of which arginine, lysine, leucine and valine were the most prevalent, and 55% were non-essential amino acids, primarily glutamic acid, alanine, proline, asparagine and glycine. A direct transfer of nauplii from a salinity of 6.6‰ to 30‰ resulted in a significant reduction in total FAA (TFAA) particularly in essential FAA (EAA). Acclimation of nauplii from a salinity of 6.6‰ to 30‰ over 3h resulted in a significant increase in TFAA and particularly in non-essential FAA (NEAA). The addition of isoleucine, leucine, lysine and valine to the holding water during acclimation further increased their concentrations in the nauplii after a 3h exposure."

The material properties which control the mass loss, and are required for input to the numerical models, are measured in independent laboratory tests, and presented. The mass loss rate for each polymer is measured in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) gasification device and predicted using two numerical models for pyrolysis: the NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) model Thermakin. For three of the polymers, the models often gave results in very close agreement with each other, and in good agreement with those of the experiments for most of the mass loss period. Nonetheless, for PET, the agreement was good only in the initial stages of heating and mass loss, when less than 3% of the mass loss had occurred, and for POM, good agreement required a different value of the heat of reaction (from the one measured for this polymer). Parametric analyses are used to explore the influence of each measured parameter on the mass loss rate and the agreement between modeling and the experiments, and to explain discrepancies between the modeling and experiment when they exist."

abstract = "Several agents are under consideration to replace CF3Br for use in suppressing fires in aircraft cargo bays. In a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) performance test simulating the explosion of an aerosol can, however, the replacements, when added at sub-inerting concentrations, have all been found to create higher pressure rise than with no agent, hence failing the test. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations as well as perfectly-stirred reactor (PSR) simulations with detailed reaction kinetics, are performed for one of these agents, C6F12O (Novec 1230), to understand the reasons for the unexpected enhanced combustion rather than suppression. The high pressure rise with added agent is shown to depend on the amount of agent, and can only occur if a large fraction of the available oxidizer in the chamber is consumed, corresponding to stoichiometric proportions of fuel, oxygen, and agent. A kinetic model for the reaction of C6F12O in hydrocarbon–air flames has been developed. Stirred-reactor simulations predict that at higher agent loadings, the inhibition effectiveness of C6F12O is relatively insensitive to the overall stoichiometry, and the marginal inhibitory effect of the agent is greatly reduced, so that the mixture remains flammable over a wide range of conditions corresponding to those of the FAA test. The present findings are consistent with and support the earlier analyses for C2HF5 and CF3Br, which were also evaluated in the FAA test."

The high pressure rise with added agent is shown to depend on the amount of agent, and is well-predicted by an equilibrium model corresponding to stoichiometric reaction of fuel, oxygen, and agent. A kinetic model for the reaction of C3H2F3Br in hydrocarbon-air flames has been applied to understand differences in the chemical suppression behavior of C3H2F3Br vs. CF3Br in the FAA test. Stirred-reactor simulations predict that in the conditions of the FAA test, the inhibition effectiveness of C3H2F3Br at high agent loadings is relatively insensitive to the overall stoichiometry (for fuel-lean conditions), and the marginal inhibitory effect of the agent is greatly reduced, so that the mixture remains flammable over a wide range of conditions. Most important, the flammability of the agent-air mixtures themselves (when compressively preheated), can support low-strain flames which are much more difficult to extinguish than the easy-to extinguish, high-strain primary fireball from the impulsively released fuel mixture. Hence, the exothermic reaction of halogenated hydrocarbons in air should be considered in other situations with strong ignition sources and low strain flows, especially at preheated conditions."

The application of that research for conservation and decision-making can be hampered by the ambiguity found in the definition of the nursery function under the ecosystem service perspective. In this paper, we review how the role of nursery habitats is included in the ecosystem services literature, covering conceptual, biophysical and economic reflections. The role of ecosystems as nurseries is mostly analyzed in coastal environments. The main observation is that there is no consensus on the consideration of the nursery function as a service (e.g. which species or habitats) or on how to assess it (e.g. which indicators or valuation methods). After that review, we analyze three different interpretations given to the nursery function, namely the ecological, conservationist and economic point of view; and we distinguish between different types of assessment that may consider the nursery function. We conclude that the nursery function can be considered an ecosystem service on its own right when it is linked to a concrete human benefit and not when it is represented with indicators of general biodiversity or ecosystem condition. Thus, the analysis of the delivery of ecosystem services should be differentiated from the analysis of ecological integrity. Only with this distinction science may be able to quantify the link between biodiversity and ecosystem services and policy may be effective in halting biodiversity loss. Similar considerations could apply for other biodiversity constituents that may be treated as ecosystem services."

The properties of the adsorbents were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and surface area analysis. Batch adsorption studies were carried out. The adsorption of Au(III) and Pd(II) onto CSGO composites was optimum at pH 3.0–5.0 for Au(III) and pH 3.0–4.0 for Pd(II), which was much wider than that of GCCS. The adsorption isotherms obeyed the Langmuir isotherm models for the adsorption of Au(III) and Pd(II). Chitosan with 5wt% graphene oxide (CSGO5) composite had the largest adsorption capacity for Au(III) and Pd(II) compared with the other prepared adsorbents, where the maximum adsorption capacity were 1076.649mg/g for Au(III) and 216.920mg/g for Pd(II), respectively. The adsorption kinetics of Au(III) and Pd(II) onto CSGO5 followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating that the chemical adsorption was the rate-limiting step. Thermodynamic parameters, such as Gibbs energy (ΔG°), enthalpy (ΔH°), and entropy (ΔS°), were calculated, showing that the adsorption of Au(III) and Pd(II) onto CSGO5 were spontaneous, endothermic and feasible. The desorption studies of Au(III) and Pd(II) onto CSGO5 showed that CSGO5 can be used repeatedly without significantly changing its adsorption capacity and desorption percentage after 3cycles. Besides CSGO5 was successfully applied for the determination and separation of Au(III) and Pd(II) in ore samples."

The as-synthesized CD-PEI was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, elemental analysis, fluorescence and zeta potential measurement. The adsorption of Cr(VI) on CD-PEI was evaluated. Its isothermal adsorption was studied and fitted in the Langmuir model. Nearly 85% of Cr(VI) was adsorbed within 10min showed that the CD-PEI exhibited fairly fast kinetics for the sorption of Cr(VI). Experimental conditions, including the content and size of CD-PEI, sample pH, adsorption time, sample volume, slurry volume and interfering ions, were further optimized to obtain efficient preconcentration and high-precision determination of Cr(VI). CD-PEI with small size turned to be a good candidate for the preparation of slurry. CD-PEI served not only as a promising adsorbent for separation and preconcentration of Cr, but also a signal-enhancing agent in FAAS. The method achieved an enhancement factor of 30 and a detection limit (S/N=3) of 0.21µgL−1 Cr(VI) with a consumption of 14.0mL sample and an adsorption time of 5min, which provided two times of signal enhancement. The RSD for 11 replicate measurements of 5.0µgL−1 Cr(VI) was 2.8%. The possible signal enhancement mechanism was proposed.

In addition, flavor compound data revealed that the aroma of rice wine using different starters mainly differed in the amounts of alcohols and esters. FAAs, flavor compounds, sensory evaluation and partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis demonstrated RAM-S wine had the best sensory characteristics with higher contents of esters, nitrogen-containing, umami and sweet FAAs, and lower of bitter FAAs. These findings demonstrated that the starter RAM-S is promising to produce rice wine with high quality standards both in flavor and fermentation performance."

In total, 48 WLOM compounds were identified, including amino acids, amino acids derivatives, organic acids, nucleic acids, vitamins, sugars, alcohols and small peptides. In addition, 16 free fatty acid compounds were detected. Compared with the other four hams, the Sanchuan ham had the highest total WLOM compounds and free fatty acid contents (P < 0.05). Comprehensive multivariate data analysis showed that free amino acids (FAAs) are the main metabolites, and FAAs accounted for about 53.45%–59.71% of the total WLOM compounds for five kinds of Yunnan dry-cured hams. These results contribute to a better understanding of quality differences in dry-cured ham."

The precision measured in terms of repeatability and reproducibility of the method expressed as percentage relative standard deviation (% RSD) were below 10% for the amino acids analyzed. The detection limits (LODs) and quantification limits (LOQs) of the method were in the range 0.4–1.0 mg/kg and 0.6–1.2 mg/kg respectively. Method had a wide linear range between 1.25–100 mg/kg with regression coefficients greater than 0.999 obtained over seven calibration levels. The method was also found robust over other cereals including corn, wheat and finger millet with satisfactory recoveries and precision values. The percentage expanded uncertainties calculated with the coverage factor of 2 (k = 2), were below 14% for the analyzed amino acids.

The extraction/preconcentration step of the analytes was performed by using a mixture of dispersant and extractant solvents (isopropanol and HNO3, respectively) and the aqueous phase containing the analytes was separated by centrifugation. Some parameters such as sample mass, type and volume of dispersant and extractant solutions, HNO3 concentration (extraction solution), use of ultrasound, centrifugation time and temperature were evaluated. During the optimization of RP-DLLME, biodiesel samples were spiked with a multi-element biodiesel B100 (Conostan®) with final concentration of 1.0 μg g−1 of the analytes. Analytes determination was performed by FAAS using external calibration with aqueous reference solutions. The limits of quantification (LOQ) for Na, K, Ca and Mg were 0.04; 0.02; 0.05 and 0.08 µg kg respectively. The accuracy was evaluated by recovery tests, which ranged from 93.9% to 108.1%, with relative standard deviation lower than 3% for all analytes. Then, the proposed method was applied for analytes determination in five biodiesel samples produced from different raw materials. Comparing to conventional methods for elements determination in biodiesel (e.g., dilution with organic solvent, sample digestion, etc.), RP-DLLME combined to FAAS is simple, low cost, low reagents consumption and provides LOQs values significantly below compared to the limits established in the legislation for these elements in biodiesel."

abstract = "During daily Food Restriction (FR), obese Neotomodon alstoni mice present decreased Food Anticipatory Activity (FAA) compared to lean mice. Here, we investigated whether FOS expression in hypothalamic nuclei involved in food synchronization and anticipation parallels decreased FAA during daily FR of obese N. alstoni. Locomotor activity of lean and obese mice in ad libitum feeding conditions was monitored for at least two weeks. Then, a gradual restriction of food access was followed to establish a 5h period of daily food access. FR was maintained during at least two weeks before sacrifice of mice at the starting point of the feeding period. Obese mice subjected to FR displayed an overall reduction of FOS-positive (FOS+) hypothalamic neurons, while lean mice in a similar protocol exhibited an increase in FOS+ neurons within the arcuate and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei. These results are consistent with decreased FAA displayed by obese mice in comparison to lean mice. Furthermore, limbic system areas of lean mice, such as the cingulate cortex and the hippocampus, showed an increase in FOS during FR, while no responses were observed in obese mice. The daily food intake of obese mice was severely reduced during FR, compared to the ad libitum condition, whereas food intake in lean mice was not affected by FR. Current data suggests that decreased hypothalamic and limbic neuronal activation may contribute to the reduction of FAA in obese N. alstoni mice."

We examine water permeation through an emerging class of anion exchange membranes, hexamethyl-p-terphenyl poly (dimethylbenzimidazolium) (HMT-PMBI), and compare it against series of membrane thickness for a commercial anion exchange membrane (AEM), Fumapem® FAA-3, and a series of proton exchange membranes, Nafion®. The HMT-PMBI membrane is found to possess higher water permeabilities than Fumapem® FAA-3 and comparable permeability than Nafion (H+). By measuring water permeation through membranes of different thicknesses, we are able to decouple, for the first time, internal and interfacial water permeation resistances through anion exchange membranes. Permeation resistances on liquid/membrane interface is found to be negligible compared to that for vapor/membrane for both series of AEMs. Correspondingly, the resistance of liquid water permeation is found to be one order of magnitude smaller compared to that of vapor water permeation. HMT-PMBI possesses larger effective internal water permeation coefficient than both Fumapem® FAA-3 and Nafion® membranes (60 and 18% larger, respectively). In contrast, the effective interfacial permeation coefficient of HMT-PMBI is found to be similar to Fumapem® (±5%) but smaller than Nafion®(H+) (by 14%)."

The existence of a food-entrainable oscillator in the mammalian nervous system was inferred previously from restricted feeding-induced behavioral rhythmicity in rodents with suprachiasmatic nucleus lesions. In the present study, we have characterized the circadian rhythmicity of behavior in Wfs1-deficient mice during ad libitum and restricted feeding. Based on the expression of Wfs1 protein in the DMH it was hypothesized that Wfs1-deficient mice will display reduced or otherwise altered food anticipatory activity. Wfs1 immunoreactivity in DMH was found almost exclusively in the compact part. Restricted feeding induced c-Fos immunoreactivity primarily in the ventral and lateral aspects of DMH and it was similar in both genotypes. Wfs1-deficiency resulted in significantly lower body weight and reduced wheel-running activity. Circadian rhythmicity of behavior was normal in Wfs1-deficient mice under ad libitum feeding apart from elongated free-running period in constant light. The amount of food anticipatory activity induced by restricted feeding was not significantly different between the genotypes. Present results indicate that the effects of Wfs1-deficiency on behavioral rhythmicity are subtle suggesting that Wfs1 is not a major player in the neural networks responsible for circadian rhythmicity of behavior."

Some effective parameters on the microextraction and the complex formation were selected and optimized. These parameters included extraction solvent type as well as extraction volume, time, temperature, and pH, the amount of the chelating agent, and salt effect. Under optimum conditions, an enrichment factor of 95 was obtained from only 5.0mL of water sample. The calibration graph was linear in the range of 10–600μgL−1 with a detection limit of 0.91μgL−1. The relative standard deviation (R.S.D) for ten replicate measurements of 50 and 500μgL−1 of cadmium were 2.56 and 1.62%. This proposed method was successfully applied in the analysis of four real environmental water samples and good spiked recoveries over the range of 96.5–101.7% were obtained."

The nanocomposites were characterized by FAAS, XRD, N2 adsorption/desorption, TEM and XPS. Activity measurements were conducted in the range of 200–500°C, in both the presence and absence of water. Among the tested catalysts, the nanocomposite with 9.5mol% Ca showed the highest catalytic activity, which could be attributed to the promoting effect of CaCO3 on α-Fe2O3 with smaller crystallite size. Experimental results in the presence of water indicated that, due to the competitive adsorption of water on the active sites, there was a local minimum of catalytic activity at 350°C. In situ FTIR experimental results revealed the presence of phenolate, catecholate, o-benzoquinone, carboxylate and anhydride type species on the surfaces of the catalysts during the oxidation of o-DCB. Spectral evidence discovered that the formate species were more prone to being formed on the surface of nanocomposite with 9.5mol% Ca and then were further oxidized to CO, which directly lead to high activity of the catalyst. A mechanism involving dissociative adsorption of o-DCB on the surface of catalyst was proposed."

In this investigation, to comprehensively assess metabolite changes in d-galactosamine (GalN)-induced liver injury in Chinese miniature pigs and to increase our understanding of physiological changes in normal and pathological states, we used ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) to analyze metabolites and identify biomarkers in serum. Blood samples were collected both from 18h after GalN treatment group and control group pigs. We performed multivariate analyses on the metabolite profiles to identify potential biomarkers of acute liver injury, which were then confirmed by tandem MS. Based on “variable of importance in the project” (VIP) values and S-plots, four groups of biomarkers were identified – namely conjugated bile acids, lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and fatty acid amides (FAAs) – that were present at significantly different levels in the control and GalN-induced groups. LPCs, PCs, and FAAs showed marked decreases in the GalN-treated group, whereas conjugated bile acids in the treated group showed considerable increases. Taken together, our results suggested that obvious metabolic disturbances occur during acute liver injury, which provided novel insights into the molecular mechanism(s) of d-galactosamine (GalN)-induced liver injury, and will facilitate future research and management of liver injury."

The catalytic activities of the samples were evaluated by catalytic oxidation of 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). The results showed that the molar ratios of Ca/(Ca+Fe) in the hollow microspheres and their morphologies significantly affected their catalytic performances. The low-temperature catalytic activity decreased in the order of FeCa10>FeCa20>Fe2O3>FeCa5, in well agreement with the sequence of their reducibility. The optimal FeCa10 catalyst exhibited not only excellent catalytic activity, water-resistant performance and stability but also lower apparent activation energy (21.6kJ/mol). In situ FTIR measurements revealed the acetate and formate species were the partial oxidation products, which could be subsequently oxidized to form CO2. It is concluded that the excellent catalytic performance of FeCa10 catalyst might be attributed to the combined effects of several factors such as small crystallite size, high surface active oxygen concentration, good low-temperature reducibility and the synergic effect between CaO and Fe3O4. It is reasonable for us to believe that such Ca-doped FeOx hollow microspheres are promising catalysts for the elimination of chlorinated volatile organic pollutants."

Two important and currently overlooked nitrogen (N) pools likely to be affected by carrion are free amino acid (FAA) and peptide pools, which are a newly recognised point of competition between plants and microorganisms for the N resource. A carcass addition experiment was established using recently (<12 h) deceased kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) carcasses to quantify soil nutrient changes in a box gum grassy woodland ecosystem. Soil samples were taken every 12 weeks, and analysed for available nutrient content and FAA and peptide turnover rates. Carcasses were a source of N, adding an average of 4.4 kg m−2 to the soils directly under the decomposing carcasses in our study, representing a significant redistribution of this resource within the ecosystem. There was also a significant and lasting input of proteins (40 mg/kg) and amino acids (25 mg/kg) into the soil, which increased microbial turnover of these labile N compounds. Dissolved organic N (DON) cycling in rangelands and natural ecosystems is an overlooked part of the N and C cycle despite representing the most important nutrient input into these systems. Based on our results, we argue for a re-think on the removal of carcasses as an ecosystem management tool, as they provide large and lasting resource islands which influence soil N cycling."

We review knowledge of the noise, air quality, and climate impacts of aviation, and demonstrate how including environmental impact assessment and quantifying uncertainties can enable a more comprehensive evaluation of aviation environmental policies. A comparison is presented between the cost-effectiveness analysis currently used for aviation environmental policy decision-making and an illustrative cost–benefit analysis. We focus on assessing a subset of the engine NOX emissions certification stringency options considered at the eighth meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection. The FAA Aviation environmental Portfolio Management Tool (APMT) is employed to conduct the policy assessments. We show that different conclusions may be drawn about the same policy options depending on whether benefits and interdependencies are estimated in terms of health and welfare impacts versus changes in NOX emissions inventories as is the typical practice. We also show that these conclusions are sensitive to a variety of modeling uncertainties. While our more comprehensive analysis makes the best policy option less clear, it represents a more accurate characterization of the scientific and economic uncertainties underlying impacts and the policy choices."

In this paper we take a look at such serverless infrastructures, which are designed mainly for processing background tasks of Web and Internet of Things applications, or event-driven stream processing. We evaluate their applicability to more compute- and data-intensive scientific workflows and discuss possible ways to repurpose serverless architectures for execution of scientific workflows. We have developed prototype workflow executor functions using AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions, coupled with the HyperFlow workflow engine. These functions can run workflow tasks in AWS and Google infrastructures, and feature such capabilities as data staging to/from S3 or Google Cloud Storage and execution of custom application binaries. We have successfully deployed and executed the Montage astronomy workflow, often used as a benchmark, and we report on initial results of its performance evaluation. Our findings indicate that the simple mode of operation makes this approach easy to use, although there are costs involved in preparing portable application binaries for execution in a remote environment. While our solution is an early prototype, we find the presented approach highly promising. We also discuss possible future steps related to execution of scientific workflows in serverless infrastructures. Finally, we perform a cost analysis and discuss implications with regard to resource management for scientific applications in general."

abstract = "A sensitive, simple separation and solid-phase procedure, which is sorption and desorption of cadmium on modified clinoptilolite zeolite (with surfactant and neothorine), for preconcentration of cadmium prior to analysis by FAAS is described. The sorbent has exhibited good sorption potential for cadmium at pH 5. Cadmium was eluted from the column by nitric acid which resulted in preconcentration factor of 160. Thermodynamic behaviors for the process are investigated and adsorption process is interpreted in term of Freundlich equation. A detection limit of 0.015ngmL−1 was obtained and it is shown that calibration curve is linear from 0.01 to 4.0μgmL−1 in the final solution. Furthermore, the effects of various parameters such as pH, flow rate of the sample and eluent solution were studied. This method was successfully applied for determination of cadmium in various plant and real water samples."

Particular attention has been given to Al and heavy metals for the identification of possible raw material contaminants, their transformation into the infusion and for predicting their eventual role in the human diet during daily consumption. Additionally, Ion Chromatography (IC) speciation of Al in the leachates was carried out. In dry herbs, hibiscus and ginkgo appeared to contain the greatest contents of Al, Fe, K, Mn, Ni, Zn and B, Mg, P, respectively. A. vera contained the highest amount of Ca and highest values of Cu and P were observed in ginseng. In infusions, the topmost concentrations of Al, B, Cu, Fe, P, K, Mn, Ni, Zn were detected in those prepared from hibiscus petals, Ca from aloe leaves and Mg from leaves of ginkgo. According to a possible daily consumption exceeding 1L, hibiscus decoction was identified as potentially dietetically significant in the content of certain elements. It seems to be possibly one of the top contributors of B from food (up to 5.5±0.2mg/L). The Mg contained in the infusion (up to 106±5mg/L) may be a contributor in the attenuation of blood pressure. A high amount of accessible Mn (up to 17.4±1.1mg/L) can probably have an adverse effect in humans. The total Al allowance (up to 1.2±0.1mg/L) suggests that no more than 1L of the hibiscus infusion should be consumed per day by sensitive individuals including pregnant women and should be completely excluded from the diet of children under 6months of age and children with chronic renal failure."

In airfields, the potential for reflective cracking presents a major challenge for rigid pavement rehabilitation involving asphalt overlays. To assist airport engineers and others concerned with the temperature-induced reflection cracks, several full-scale test pavements have been constructed, instrumented, and tested at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Airport Pavement Test Facility (NAPTF). The main objective of this study was to identify and develop correlations between full-scale and laboratory reflective cracking tests. A customized Overlay Tester (COT) and Cyclic Disc-Shaped Compact Tension (CDCT) Test were used evaluate the fracture and fatigue performance of hot mix asphalt (HMA) materials at low temperatures. The COT was conducted at the same conditions as the full-scale tests and test results were analyzed using several parameters. Temperature effect was pronounced in strain parameters (initial strain, failure strain, and strain at Nf(NLC)). Further fatigue parameters (Nf(crack) and Nf(NLC)) indicated a swifter deterioration of HMA mixture at a higher displacement (cooling) rate. Fracture parameter (Gfini) was found to decrease with the increase of displacement rate due to the brittleness of HMA at low temperatures as excepted. A two-term exponential function from the CDCT tests demonstrated the fracture behavior of HMA under cyclic loading. The released energy rate factor (R2) correlated well with the fatigue life. Finally, a set of shift factors were derived between the full-scale, OT, and CDCT tests. Valuable data obtained from this study provides immediate support to the future FAA reflective cracking research."

This technique showed excellent linearity with r2 values ranging from 0.9029 to 0.9995 and instrumental limits of detection ranging from 0.3 to 46pg for the different amino acids. The quality of water used for sample extraction was found to be of utmost importance for achieving low blank levels of FAA and CAA. The addition of isopropanol during the extraction of aerosols was also shown to minimize the coextraction of inorganic salts that interfered with the analysis of FAA, Moreover, the ascorbic acid was found to be the most effective reagent for preventing the oxidative destruction of CAA during the hydrolysis process. By the analysis of spiked aerosol samples, the average recoveries determined for FAA and CAA were higher than 60% and the associated relative standard deviation was lower than 10% for the majority of amino acids. The application of the adopted method in background aerosols of the eastern Mediterranean enabled the unambiguous identification and quantification of 20 amino acids. The total concentration of FAA and CAA in aerosols ranged from 13 to 34ngm−3 and from 29 to 79ngm−3, respectively. The GC–MS based method is proposed to overcome several analytical difficulties usually encountered with the conventional HPLC-fluoresence technique."

The total concentration of CAA (719 ± 326 pmol m−3) was on average four times higher than that of FAA (172 ± 147 pmol m−3), while glycine was the most abundant compound detected in both FAA and CAA. Back-trajectory analysis demonstrated that the geographical origin of the air masses did not have a significant influence on the atmospheric levels of amino acids. Wind speed was found to be the most important meteorological factor and it exhibited a negative correlation with both FAA and CAA. Moreover, FAA and CAA concentrations showed a more pronounced correlation with water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) than elemental carbon. On average, FAA and CAA accounted for 0.3 ± 0.2% and 1.8 ± 0.8% of WSOC, respectively. The levels of anionic surfactants determined as methylene blue active substances did not show any positive correlation with CAA, while the corresponding correlation with FAA was only of marginal significance. The total protein concentration measured by NanoOrange assay was six times higher compared to that measured through CAA. It is suggested that the results from the application of commercially available protein quantitation kits should always be considered with caution, as these are more prone to matrix-related interferences."

This research sought to investigate the influence of seed coat colour on the abundance of mineral elements in Bambara groundnut. Four landraces (G340A, Kazai, Kazuma, and Mana) varying in seed coat colour were analysed for differences in seed mineral composition using energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Seeds were germinated at 10 °C and 25 °C, and various indices including, (1) mean emergence time, (2) mean germination rate, (3) coefficient of velocity of germination, and (4) final germination percentage (FGP) were calculated. The importance of seed mineral elements in the establishment of Bambara groundnut was examined by measuring root length (RL), shoot length (SL), shoot dry mass (SDM), and root dry mass (RDM). Plant tissue elemental analysis was done using flame atomic emission spectrometry (FAES) for K and flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) for Mg, Cu, Mn, and Zn. There were significant differences (P < 0.001) in mineral element content of dry seeds. G340A and Kazai had the highest and the lowest K, P, Mg, Mn, and Zn (11.65 gkg-1, 7.2 gkg-1, 2.33 gkg-1, 59.56 mgkg-1, and 44.42 mgkg-1), and (8.82 gkg-1, 4.75 gkg-1, 1.38 gkg-1, 48.9 mgkg-1, and 42.6 mgkg-1), respectively. Cold test germination indices were significantly different, the highest FGP was 73.3% in G340A and the lowest was 57.8% in Kazai. There were strong positive correlations between seed mineral concentration and plant growth parameters (p < 0.001). We concluded that (1) seed mineral concentration has a significant impact on the early establishment of Bambara groundnut and (2) the dark-coloured landraces (hue 8º) used in this study have the highest concentration of macro and micro elements compared to light coloured seeds (hue 38º)."

Fibre colour hue was found to be dependent on the mordant ion nature, mordant bath concentration and dyeing procedure. Mordant ion quantification showed that the uptake of metal ion by the fibres is relatively small, with the Cu ion presenting the highest affinity for the fibre. MD method yields fibres with higher amounts of metal ions and larger chromophore chromatographic peak areas corresponding, in general, to stronger colour hues. Photodegradation was more severe in alum mordant samples and in the first 480h of light exposure. Chromophore degradation rates are unequal and dependent on the mordant nature, contributing for colour changes observed after light exposure."

Mordant ion quantification was done after fiber acid digestion, by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS). Mordant metal ion, mordant bath concentration and dyeing procedure were found to have strong influence in the wool fiber hues. Color variation was more pronounced in the alum dyed samples. Overall, mordant quantification showed that the amount of metal ions found in the fibers is very small when compared to the original concentrations of the dyeing bath, being Cu the ion with greater affinity for the wool fibers. MD dyeing procedure yielded fibers with larger amounts of mordant metal ions and higher chromophore peak areas. Higher amounts of brazilein were extracted from wool mordanted with copper(II) sulfate. Finally, chromatographic analysis of the brazilwood dyed samples before and after light exposure resulted in the detection of Type C compound as an outcome of the photodegradation process."

This article estimates the short- and long-term impact of the US FAA downgrade of the Philippine civil aviation system in 2008 and the EU ban of Philippine carriers in 2010 on tourist expenditures, arrivals, and length of stay using monthly time series data. The econometric model, consisting of three equations due to the endogeneity of the tourist arrivals and length of stay variables in the tourist expenditures equation, is estimated simultaneously using the generalized method of moments. The results indicate that the US FAA downgrade and the EU ban impact monthly tourist receipts negatively in the short term while the downgrade also impacts tourist expenditures in the long term. Moreover, the ban impacts length of stay negatively in the short and long term while the downgrade impacts length of stay negatively only in the long term. The substantial decline in tourism receipts from 2008 to 2010 despite an increasing trend in tourist arrivals is due to the shorter stay of tourists, indicating that high-spending tourists have not returned following the downgrade and ban."

In N-limited ecosystems, atmospheric N input is regarded as an important nutrient source for plant growth. However, it remains an open question on how elevated N deposition affects plant growth in N-rich forest ecosystems. To address this question, we used a simulated N deposition experiment in an N-rich mature tropical forest of southern China, with N addition levels as 0kgNha−1yr−1 (Control), 50kgNha−1yr−1 (Low-N), 100kgNha−1yr−1 (Middle-N) and 150kgNha−1yr−1 (High-N), respectively. We measured foliar nutrient element status (e.g., N, P, K, Ca and Mg), N metabolism and photosynthesis capacity of three dominant understory plant species (Cryptocarya concinna and Cryptocarya chinensis as medium-light species; and Randia canthioides as shade tolerant species) in this forest. Results showed that two years of N addition greatly increased foliar N content, but decreased the content of nutrient cations (e.g., K, Ca and Mg). Nitrogen addition also increased N accumulation as organic forms as soluble protein and/or free amino acid (FAA), but not as chlorophyll in all three species. We further found that the photosynthesis capacity (Pmax) of C. concinna and C. chinensis decreased significantly with elevated N addition, with no effects on R. canthioides. However, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) significantly declined with N addition for all three species, with significantly negative relationships between PNUE/Pmax and foliar N content. These findings suggest that excess N inputs can accelerate nutrient imbalance, and inhibit photosynthetic capacity of understory plant species, indicating continuous high N deposition can threat understory plant growth in N-rich tropical forests in the future. Meanwhile, PNUE can be used as a sensitive indicator to assess ecosystem N status under chronic N deposition."

Recently, more attention has been devoted to the contribution of maintenance to accidents and incidents. This study investigates and quantifies the contribution of maintenance, both in terms of frequency and severity, to passenger airline risk by analyzing three different sources of data from 1999 to 2008: 769 NTSB accident reports, 3242 FAA incident reports, and 7478 FAA records of fines and other legal actions taken against airlines and associated organizations. We analyze several safety related metrics and develop an aviation maintenance risk scorecard that collects these metrics to synthesize a comprehensive track record of maintenance contribution to airline accidents and incidents. We found for example that maintenance-related accidents are approximately 6.5 times more likely to be fatal than accidents in general, and that when fatalities do occur, maintenance accidents result in approximately 3.6 times more fatalities on average. Our analysis of accident trends indicates that this contribution to accident risk has remained fairly constant over the past decade. Our analysis of incidents and FAA fines and legal actions also revealed similar trends. We found that at least 10% of incidents involving mechanical failures such as ruptured hydraulic lines can be attributed to maintenance, suggesting that there may be issues surrounding both the design of and compliance with maintenance plans. Similarly 36% of FAA fines and legal actions involve inadequate maintenance, with recent years showing a decline to about 20%, which may be a reflection of improved maintenance practices. Our results can aid industry and government in focusing resources to continue improving aviation safety."

Introduction
Static progressive orthotic devices are efficient in treating contractures. However, current outriggers are unable to keep force transmission and the force application angle (FAA) constant.
Purpose of the Study
To evaluate the biomechanical performance of the Isoforce outrigger, a novel extension orthosis.
Methods
A hand model was used to measure the required force at the outrigger and FAA, while simulating resolution of different contracture angles. We also tested feasibility in a small patient series.
Results
The force required with the Isoforce device never exceeded 2.4 N, and the FAA did not change more than 6°. Corresponding figures for the reference devices exceeded 16 N and 20°. The 7 patients testing the Isoforce extension device showed an extension deficit that decreased from 40° at baseline to 25° at 6 weeks. They rated the device as very comfortable to wear.
Conclusions
Isoforce maintains constant force transmission and FAA throughout the full range of motion, promotes the lengthening of contracted structures, and is comfortable to wear.

The presence of other healthy molecules (eg, insulin-secretion stimulating peptides, anticoagulants, immune modulators, antidepressors, bacteriocins, and others) have also been reported in fermented seafood products. This chapter summarizes the most recent advances in the search for bioactive molecules in fermented seafood products with an interest in human health. This chapter also discusses different technological approaches to eliminating undesirable compounds that are associated with health risks and to improving product quality."

Their capacity to attenuate emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) has not yet been evaluated. The present study reports the results of a 2-year EOC monitoring carried out using a poplar VF receiving wastewater primarily treated by an Imhoff tank. The compounds selected included analgesics, a β-adrenergic blocker, stimulants, an anticonvulsant, an anti-depressant, an anti-inflammatory, an antibiotic and analgesic and stimulant metabolites. EOCs were analysed in the Imhoff tank effluent, in the infiltrated water at a depth of 90cm and in the groundwater at a depth of 10m. The results demonstrated that EOC attenuation was more significant in the first 90cm than in the rest of the soil profile. The removal efficiency for all of the selected EOCs was higher than 90% with the exception of ketoprofen, which may pose a higher threat of groundwater contamination. The observed attenuation correlated with the hydrophobicity and charge state of the EOCs. The higher persistence of the metabolites 4-AAA and 4-FAA shows that progression in the degradation pathway does not always imply a mitigation of contamination."

The methodology is based on the complexation of Cd with 2-(5-bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-diethylaminophenol (5-Br-PADAP) reagent after sample digestion followed by extraction of the complex with the RTIL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C4mim][PF6]). The mixture was loaded into a flow injection analysis (FIA) manifold and the RTIL rich-phase was retained in a microcolumn filled with silica gel. The RTIL rich-phase was then eluted directly into FAAS. A enhancement factor of 35 was achieved with 20mL of sample. The limit of detection (LOD), obtained as IUPAC recommendation, was 6ngg−1 and the relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) for 10 replicates at 10μgL−1 Cd concentration level was 3.9%, calculated at the peak heights. The calibration graph was linear and a correlation coefficient of 0.9998 was achieved. The accuracy of the method was evaluated by both a recovery study and comparison of results with direct determination by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). The method was successfully applied for Cd determination in plastic food packaging materials and Cd concentrations found were in the range of 0.04–10.4μgg−1."

International space law is ambiguous as to accommodating suborbital activities. While some provisions of the UN outer space treaties would seem to exclude them, generally there is not any explicit condition in terms of reaching orbit as a requirement for application. International air law presents equal difficulties in dealing with this activity. The classic definition of “aircraft” as contained in the Annexes to the Chicago Convention does not really encompass the kind of rocket-powered vehicles that are envisaged here. As a result, it is unclear whether the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), or both could be involved in an eventual international regulation of suborbital flight. In the absence of a uniform international regime, each state has the sovereign right to regulate human suborbital flights operating within its airspace. So far, two practical solutions have been realised or proposed, and will be analyzed. On the one hand, the USA granted power for regulation and licensing over private human suborbital flight to the Office of Commercial Space Transportation of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA/AST). Subsequent regulations by the FAA have set out a series of requirements for companies that want to operate these flights, enabling a market to develop. On the other side of the Atlantic, both the European Space Agency (ESA) and a group of representatives of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) of the European Union (EU) seem to rather regard this activity as aviation, potentially subject to the regulation and certification competences of EASA, although recent developments may indicate a changed view. Due to these differences, it is uncertain when this activity will be considered aviation and when it will be considered as spaceflight. However, the characterization as either of these has important consequences for the industry and for a stable regulatory landscape. In the longer term, from an international and a European perspective, the best solution for regulation may be to create a sui generis legal regime specifically addressing the particular nature of suborbital flight. Suborbital transportation is neither aviation nor spaceflight; it is rather something in between. A new legal regime would be able to combine notions of both air and space law, in order to overcome and resolve the current deficiencies of each discipline."

One of the key issues of this project was to outline a desirable regulatory framework that would best serve the interests of all European stakeholders in this new activity. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a series of requirements for operators of commercial suborbital flights under the 2004 Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act (CSLAA), enabling the corresponding market to develop. These regulations were initially valid until 2012 but have now been extended until 2015. In Europe, practical and successful attempts to fly experimental vehicles of this kind do not yet exist. However, several developments indicate that it is becoming urgent to pay attention to this potential new industry and find ways to regulate it in a safe yet flexible manner. Although the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) explored the possibility in 2008 to prepare for a certification approach under the concept of “Suborbital Aeroplanes” (SoA), this initiative was put on hold in 2011, and a final decision by the European Commission is still pending. This paper highlights some of the research performed by the authors towards the establishment of a roadmap for future regulation of suborbital flight in Europe. In particular, it will present results of a survey carried out among stakeholders, including operators and manufacturers of vehicles, spaceports, national and European regulators, insurers and brokers, consultants, users and lobbyists. The paper also presents results from the workshop on the future regulatory framework for suborbital flights in Europe, which was co-organised by the present authors and held in Brussels in October 2012."

abstract = "Runway incursions are an important aviation safety concern; between 2002 and 2015 there were 16,785 runway incursions at United States airports ranging in size from small general aviation (GA) to large commercial airline hubs. When examining airports with the 50 highest incursion count over the past 5 years, the predominant categories were large hubs, which accounted for 21 airports and general aviation (GA) airports which accounted for 16 airports. In June 2015, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced the Runway Incursion Mitigation (RIM) program to identify airport risk factors that might contribute to a runway incursion and develop strategies to help airport stakeholders mitigate those risks. Different size airports serve different aircraft fleets, serve different operating volumes, and have different resources available (both funds and technologies) for incursion mitigation. Therefore, it is valuable to determine the correlating factors that affect incursions at different size airports. This paper uses econometrics based modelling techniques to identify statistically significant factors in data provided by the (FAA) public web sites on runway incursions. The model identified statistically significant variables that correlate with incursions, based on severity, for airports categories defined by the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS). The model results indicate that operational incidents (OI) are more likely at large hub airports. In contrast, at GA/non-hub airports, pilot deviations (PD) were significant for less severe incursions (severity C and D). Only one variable, “number of years since 2002”, was found to be significant for all the three airport categories; this variable was correlated with severity A incursions and indicated a statistically significant reduction in severity A incursions, despite an overall 80% increase in incursions between 2002 and 2015."

It maps ∫V(δJ) and JΔJ to δϕcΔδϕc and ∫V(ϕc), respectively, with ϕc=∫JΔ and Δ the Feynman propagator. Comparing the Schwinger representation with its dual version one gets a little known relation that we prove to be a particular case of a more general operatorial relation. We then derive a new representation of the generating functional T[ϕc]=W[J] expressed in terms of covariant derivatives acting on 1T[ϕc]=NN0exp⁡(−U0[ϕc])exp⁡(−∫V(Dϕc−))⋅1 where Dϕ±(x)=∓Δδδϕ(x)+ϕ(x). The dual representation, which is deeply related to the Hermite polynomials, is the key to express the generating functional associated to a sum of potentials in terms of factorized generating functionals. This is applied to renormalization, leading to a factorization of the counterterms of the interaction. We investigate the structure of the functional generator for normal ordered potentials and derive an infinite set of relations in the case of the potential λn!:ϕn: . Such relations are explicitly derived by using the Faà di Bruno formula. This also yields the explicit expression of the generating functional of connected Green's functions."

Studies for the determination of amino acids in the atmosphere are extremely diverse, encompassing an array of different analytical methodologies; however, it is not possible to conduct a comparative study of these methods.

To evaluate the binding of trace elements to colloidal particles, the filtrates were analyzed for major compounds (FAAS, ICP-OES and HPLC) and trace elements (ICP-MS) and the obtained elemental patterns were statistically evaluated.

Characteristic features of the behaviour of trace elements and the main compounds were more pronounced at the active landfill site.

The accuracy of prediction in external validation was the same irrespective of whether undertaken on the entire external validation data set or just within the Holstein-Friesian breed. The strongest coefficient of correlation obtained for protein fractions in external validation was 0.74, 0.69, and 0.67 for total casein, total β-lactoglobulin, and β-casein, respectively. Total proteins (i.e., total casein, total whey, and total lactoglobulin) were predicted with greater accuracy then their respective component traits; prediction accuracy using the infrared spectrum was superior to prediction using just milk protein concentration. Weak to moderate prediction accuracies were observed for FAA. The greatest coefficient of correlation in both cross validation and external validation was for Gly (0.75), indicating a moderate accuracy of prediction. Overall, the FAA prediction models overpredicted the gold standard values. Near-unity correlations existed between total casein and β-casein irrespective of whether the traits were based on the gold standard (0.92) or mid-infrared spectroscopy predictions (0.95). Weaker correlations among FAA were observed than the correlations among the protein fractions. Pearson correlations between gold standard protein fractions and the milk processing characteristics of rennet coagulation time, curd firming time, curd firmness, heat coagulating time, pH, and casein micelle size were weak to moderate and ranged from −0.48 (protein and pH) to 0.50 (total casein and a30). Pearson correlations between gold standard FAA and these milk processing characteristics were also weak to moderate and ranged from −0.60 (Val and pH) to 0.49 (Val and K20).

The objective of the present study was to identify the factors associated with both the protein composition and free amino acid (FAA) composition of bovine milk predicted using mid-infrared spectroscopy. Milk samples were available from 7 research herds and 69 commercial herds. The spectral data from the research herds comprised 94,286 separate morning and evening milk samples; the spectral data from the commercial herds comprised 40,260 milk samples representing a composite sample of both the morning and evening milkings. Mid-infrared spectroscopy prediction models developed in a previous study were applied to all spectra. Factors associated with the predicted protein and FAA composition were quantified using linear mixed models. Factors considered in the model included the fixed effects of calendar month of the test, milking time (i.e., morning, evening, or both combined), parity (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and ≥6), stage of lactation, the interaction between parity and stage of lactation, breed proportion of the cow (Friesian, Jersey, Norwegian Red, Montbéliarde, and other), and both the general heterosis and recombination coefficients of the cow. Contemporary group as well as both within- and across-lactation permanent environmental effects were included in all models as random effects. Total proteins (i.e., total casein, CN; total whey; and total β-lactoglobulin) and protein fractions (with the exception of α-lactalbumin) decreased postcalving until 36 to 65 days in milk and increased thereafter. After adjusting the statistical model for differences in crude protein content and milk yield separately, irrespective of stage of lactation, younger animals produced more total proteins (i.e., total CN, total whey, and total β-lactoglobulin) as well as more total FAA, Glu, and Asp than their older contemporaries. The concentration of all protein fractions (except β-CN) in milk was greatest in the evening milk, even after adjusting for differences in the crude protein content of the milk. Relative to a purebred Holstein cow, Jersey cows, on average, produced a greater concentration of all CN fractions but less total FAA, Glu, Gly, Asp, and Val in milk. Relative to their respective purebred parental average, first-cross cows produced more total CN and more β-CN. Results from the present study indicate that many cow-level factors, as well as other factors, are associated with protein composition and FAA composition of bovine milk."

abstract = "Use of over-the-counter, prescription, and illicit drugs is increasing in the United States (US). Many of these drugs are psychoactive and can affect the user’s ability to safely operate a vehicle. However, data about drug use by vehicle operators is typically limited to a small proportion of operators and a short list of drugs. For instance, required testing for commercial vehicle operators following most accidents is limited to a urine test for 11 drugs. By comparison, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), routinely tests fatally injured pilots’ blood and tissues for hundreds of compounds. This study used the results from these tests to assess drug use in aviation.
Methods
Using matched data from the FAA’s Civil Aerospace Medical Institute toxicology database and the National Transportation Safety Board’s (NTSB’s) aviation accident database, this study examined trends in the prevalence of over-the-counter, prescription, and illicit drugs identified in toxicology tests of fatally injured pilots between 1990 and 2012. Cases that failed to match or where toxicology testing had not been performed were excluded. Pilots identified by the NTSB investigation as being the “flying pilot” at the time of the accident and results from blood or tissues were included. Toxicology results for ethanol and other alcohols were not included. Positive test results were categorized by drug type and potential for causing impairment. Analysis used SPSS Version 19.1 to perform linear by linear chi-squared statistics.
Results
The study included 6677 pilots or 87% of the eligible subjects. The large majority were male (98%) and flying general aviation operations (96%) at the time of their fatal accident. There were increasing trends in pilots’ use of all drugs, potentially impairing drugs, drugs used to treat potentially impairing conditions, drugs designated as controlled substances, and illicit drugs. The most common potentially impairing drug pilots had used was diphenhydramine, a sedating antihistamine that is an active ingredient in many over-the-counter allergy formulations, cold medicines, and sleep aids in the US. Although evidence of illicit drug use was found only in a small number of cases, the percentage of pilots testing positive for marijuana use increased during the study period, mostly in the last 10 years."

In this study, we reported a convenient method to synthesize NATs in fair yield and characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR. Fluorescence spectroscopy study showed that NATs form micelles in an aqueous environment and the critical micellar concentration (CMC) follows a linear trend with respect to fatty acid acyl chain length. Differential scanning calorimetry reveals that NATs undergoes broad endothermic transition with transition temperatures increases with increasing fatty acid acyl chain length though the magnitude of change from one chain length to another chain length decreases as the acyl chain length increase. The transition enthalpy (ΔHt) and transition entropy (ΔSt) corresponding to the chain-melting phase transition depends linearly on the acyl chain length and fitted to a linear equation, which yielded the incremental values, ΔHinc (1.09±0.03kcal·mol−1) and ΔSinc (2.96±0.16cal·mol−1·K−1), contributed by each methylene unit to ΔHt and ΔSt. The end contributions arising from the head group and the terminal methyl group were calculated to be ΔH0=−7.28±0.46kcal·mol−1 and ΔS0=−17.36±2.11cal·mol−1·K−1. Thermodynamic parameters, incremental values of ΔHinc and ΔSinc suggest that the acyl chains in NATs are tightly packed and the obtained larger negative ΔS0 suggest that the hydration of polar sulfonate group of NATs also play an important role in the self-assembly of NATs."

The sorbent was synthesized by combining of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and Aliquat®336 thiosalicylate, [A336][TS], a thiol-containing task specific ionic liquid (TSIL). The high affinity of TSIL toward the target compound as well as the magnetic behavior of Fe3O4 was combined to provide an efficient and simple magnetic sorbent for solid-phase extraction (SPE). The prepared nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The important parameters influencing the extraction efficiency such as pH, sorbent dosage, extraction and desorption conditions were studied and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, the calibration curve was linear in the range of 2.5–260ngmL−1 and good linearity (R2>0.996) was obtained. The limit of detection (LOD) and enrichment factor (EF) of the method were found to be 0.5ngmL−1 and 50, respectively. The relative standard deviations (RSDs %) were less than 3.1 (n=6) for the target analyte. In this method, only small amounts (20mg) of adsorbent were needed to obtain satisfactory extraction recoveries within 20min. Finally, the proposed method was successfully applied for the trace determination of cadmium ions in fruit (apple, orange and banana) and water samples. Good spike recoveries, varied within the range of 95–109%, confirmed the good performance of the method in real sample analysis."

Via a reduction to matching, we show that this equilibrium can be computed combinatorially in strongly polynomial time. Moreover, there is a special set of equilibrium prices, which can be computed easily, that is identical to the VCG solution, and therefore the market is incentive compatible (truthful) in dominant strategy."

In this study, Quasielastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) is employed to study water rotational and diffusive dynamics in the hydroxide form of a model AEM (Fumatech FAA-3) at water contents relevant for application. Two distinct diffusion time- and length-scales are accessed: “Localized” diffusion at the lower Ångstrom/tens of picosecond scale and “extended” diffusion at the higher Ångstrom/hundreds of picosecond scale. The localized diffusion length scale is smaller than the membrane's water domain thickness and its diffusion coefficients remain close to the value of bulk water even at decreasing water content. Extended diffusion approaches the thickness of the water domain and its diffusion coefficients decrease strongly with decreasing water content. A master curve links water domain thickness to the extended water diffusion coefficients for the alkaline hydrocarbon model AEM and literature data on acidic per-fluorinated Proton Exchange Membranes."

From a symmetric set operad, we give here a simple construction of a commutative and non-co-commutative Hopf algebra, that we call the natural Hopf algebra of the operad. We obtain a combinatorial formula for its antipode in terms of Schröder trees, generalizing the Haiman–Schmitt formula for the Faá di Bruno Hopf algebra. From there we derive antipode formulas for specific operads. The classical Lagrange inversion formula is obtained in this way from the set operad of pointed sets. We also derive antipodes formulas for the natural Hopf algebra corresponding to the operads of connected graphs, the NAP operad, and for its generalization, the set operad of trees enriched with a monoid. When the set operad is left cancellative, we can construct a family of posets. The natural Hopf algebra is then obtained as a reduced incidence Hopf algebra, by taking a suitable equivalence relation over the intervals of that family of posets. We also present a simple combinatorial construction of an epimorphism from the natural Hopf algebra corresponding to the NAP operad, to the Connes and Kreimer Hopf algebra. For non-symmetric operads a similar construction leads to the world of non-commutative Hopf algebras. We recover from our general formula the Novelli–Thibon combinatorial form of the antipode for the non-commutative Hopf algebra of formal diffeomorphisms."

The Langmuir linear isotherm fitted to the experimental adsorption isotherm very well, and the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 17.88mgg−1.

The method was based on on-line adsorption of Cd(II) onto SiO2/Al2O3/Nb2O5 at pH 8.64, in which the quantitative desorption occurs with 1.0molL−1 hydrochloric acid towards FAAS detector. The experimental parameters related to the system were studied by means of multivariate analysis, using 24 full factorial design and Doehlert matrix.

Numerous investigations demonstrated that Zn bioavailability in human milk is for infant much higher than in cow's milk. It was presumed that in the LMM human milk fraction highly bioavailable Zn-citrate prevails. However, literature data are controversial regarding the amount of Zn-citrate in human milk since analytical procedures reported were not quantitative. So, complex investigation was carried out to develop analytical method for quantitative determination of this biologically important molecule. Studies were performed within the pH range 5–7 by the use of synthetic solutions of Zn-citrate prepared in HEPES, MOPS and MES buffers. Zn-citrate was separated on weak anion-exchange convective interaction media (CIM) diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) monolithic chromatographic column using NH4NO3 as an eluent. Separated Zn species were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Quantitative separation of Zn-citrate complexes ([Zn(Cit)]− and [Zn(Cit)2]4−; column recoveries 94–102%) and good repeatability and reproducibility of results with relative standard deviation (RSD±3.0%) were obtained. In fractions under the chromatographic peaks Zn-binding ligand was identified by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS-MS). Limits of detection (LOD) for determination of Zn-citrate species by CIM DEAE-FAAS and CIM DEAE-ICP-MS were 0.01μg ZnmL−1 and 0.0005μg ZnmL−1, respectively. Both techniques were sensitive enough for quantification of Zn-citrate in human milk. Results demonstrated that about 23% of total Zn was present in the LMM milk fraction and that LMM-Zn corresponded to Zn-citrate. The developed speciation method represents a reliable analytical tool for investigation of the percentage and the amount of Zn-citrate in human milk."

abstract = "In this study, a fast and simple method is proposed for the determination of Cu in sugar cane spirits employing fast sequential flame atomic absorption spectrometry and the internal standard technique. First, Ag, Bi, Co and Ni were evaluated as internal standards to minimize transport interferences. The results demonstrated that Ag at a concentration of 2mgL−1 was effective. Under these conditions, Cu could be determined with a limit of detection of 15µgL−1. Then, Cu was determined in 5 sugar cane spirit samples using the proposed method and the results were compared with those obtained by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry after microwave oven acid digestion. The content of Cu varied from 0.66 to 6.64mgL−1. Accuracy and precision of the proposed method were evaluated by comparing the results obtained with both methods. A paired t-test at a 95% confidence level showed that the proposed method enabled the achievement of similar results as those obtained by ICP OES after acid digestion."

The photometric procedure was based on the reaction of Fe(III) with SCN−. An oxidizing step using a K2S2O8 solution was included to allow iron (II) determination. The compound was monitored using a blue LED (λ=474nm) as a radiation source. The robustness of the equipment setup and analytical procedure for work in adverse operational conditions was ascertained by carrying out the assays without controlling the temperature of the laboratory, which varied daily from 22°C to 35°C. Baseline drift and noise increases were not observed. Furthermore, reagent solutions presented a 10 days lifetime. Accuracy assessed by employing FAAS and o-phenantroline photometric procedure as reference methods indicated that there was no significant difference at a 95% confidence level. Useful features included linear responses ranging from 0.1 up to 2.0mgL−1 Fe(II) (r=0.997) and Fe(III) (r=0.999), respectively; detection limits of 0.08mgL−1 Fe (II) and 0.06mgL−1 Fe (III), respectively; a coefficient of variation of 1.7% (n=7) for both analytes; reagent consumption of 4.8mg KSCN and 0.8mgK2S2O8 per determination; a sampling throughput of 64 determination per hour; and a waste generation of 1.42mL per determination. The weight of the equipment, including solenoid micro-pumps, photometer, electric batteries and the metallic box used for its accommodation was approximately 3kg. The electric battery used to feed the setup worked 55h without reloading, while the reagent solutions had a lifetime of 10 days."

Coupled to flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS), the potential of this lab-at-valve scheme is demonstrated for trace lead determination in environmental and biological water samples. A hydrophobic complex of lead with ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (APDC) was formed on-line and subsequently extracted into an 80μL plug of chloroform. The extraction procedure was performed by forming micro-droplets of aqueous phase into the plug of the extractant. All critical parameters that affect the efficiency of the system were studied and optimized. The proposed method offered good performance characteristics and high preconcentration ratios. For 10mL sample consumption an enhancement factor of 125 was obtained. The detection limit was 1.8μgL−1 and the precision expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD) at 50.0μgL−1 of lead was 2.9%.

Rodents placed on a fixed feeding schedule show behavioral and physiological anticipation of mealtime referred to as food-anticipatory activity (FAA). FAA is driven by the food-entrainable oscillator (FEO), whose anatomical substrate is not yet known. Recent data have shown that restricted feeding schedules for regular chow and daily limited access to palatable food in free-feeding rats activate distinct brain regions during FAA. The combination of a deprivation regimen and scheduled access to palatable food may give rise to a more global anticipatory mechanism because the temporal cycles of energy balance would be strongly modulated by the incentive properties of palatable food; however, the neuronal response to this combined treatment is not yet known. The present study investigated how adding palatable sucrose to feeding schedules affects the pattern of brain c-fos mRNA expression during FAA (0–3 h) and 1 h following feeding. The rats maintained on scheduled chow access increased their daily chow intake, while the rats maintained on scheduled sucrose and chow mainly increased their daily sucrose intake. Adding sucrose to scheduled feeding displaced c-fos mRNA expression from the dorsomedial and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei and posterior lateral hypothalamus (LH) to the prefrontal cortex, lateral septum, nucleus accumbens and anterior LH. During refeeding, the rats on scheduled sucrose demonstrated higher activation of the nucleus of the solitary tract. The present results suggest that palatable sucrose combined with restricted feeding schedules activate a distinct neuronal network compared to neuronal activation produced by scheduled access to regular chow. These data provide evidence that the brain may contain different food-oscillatory systems and that food palatability may shift the neuronal activity from the medial hypothalamus to the limbic and reward-related areas even at the negative metabolic state."

There is some evidence coming from preclinical and clinical studies suggesting a relationship between dietary zinc intake and depressive symptoms. The aim of the study was to determine whether zinc deficiency alters the response to antidepressants with a different mechanism of action.We examine also whether these changes are related to activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal HPA axis.
Methods
Male CD-1 mice were assigned to groups according to diet and antidepressant administration. To evaluate animal behavior, the immobility time in the forced swim test (FST) and locomotor activity were measured. To determine serum zinc levels the flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) was used. The serum corticosterone was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA).
Results
Antidepressants administered to zinc-deprived mice induced an altered response in the FST when compared to animals fed with an adequate diet. There were no changes in locomotor activity. Animals subjected to a zinc-deficient diet showed a significant reduction in serum zinc levels, which was normalized by antidepressant treatment. An increase in serum corticosterone concentrations in mice fed with a zinc-deficient diet and treated with antidepressants was observed, so it can be concluded that reduced levels of zinc contribute hyperactivation of the HPA axis.
Conclusion
The results of this study suggest that a diet with a reduced zinc level alters antidepressant action, which is associated with a reduction in the serum zinc level and rise in the corticosterone level. The results of this study may indicate the involvement of zinc deficiency in the pathogenesis of depression."

The main factors affecting CPE efficiency, such as pH of sample solution, concentration of PAN and Triton X-114, equilibration temperature and time, were investigated in detail. A preconcentration factor of 30 was obtained for the preconcentration of Pb(II) ion with 15.0mL solution. Under the optimal conditions, the calibration curve was linear in the range of 7.5ngmL−1–3.5μgmL−1 of lead with R2=0.9998 (n=10). Detection limit based on three times the standard deviation of the blank (3Sb) was 5.27ngmL−1. Eight replicate determinations of 1.0μgmL−1 lead gave a mean absorbance of 0.275 with a relative standard deviation of 1.6%. The high efficiency of cloud point extraction to carry out the determination of analytes in complex matrices was demonstrated. The proposed method has been applied for determination of trace amounts of lead in biological and water samples with satisfactory results."

The analyte, usually present in solution, first has to be atomized in a flame. Premixed combustion flame, a mixture of fuel and oxidant gas, and diffusion flames, where the fuel is also the carrier gas which burns on contact with air, are the most used types of flames. The sample solution is aspirated in through a small tube and transported to the nebulizer where it is broken up into a fine aerosol. Then, the aerosol is carried to the flame, by a carrier gas and broken up into its individual atoms. FAAS could be used for the analysis of large number of trace metals in a variety of sample matrices. Prior analysis, the correct sample preparation and the control of chemical, ionization and spectral interferences are important method considerations."

In 2009 the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) introduced a slow growth approach to certifying composite, adhesively bonded structures and bonded repairs which could improve the situation and is worthy of further investigation. In this paper the growth of some (limited) damage types available in the literature are reviewed and a framework proposed to address the damage tolerance assessment of these structures."

Other aspects of this reinforcement are discussed in this chapter. This represents the first bonded reinforcement to primary structure and was successful in that by reducing the strains at the critical location by approximately 30% it achieved its primary objective namely to stop cracking and wing failure in the RAAF F-111 fleet and Cold Proof Load Test (CPLT; explained later). A significant outcome of the F-111 WPF reinforcement program was that it resulted in a detailed understanding of the design/assessment tools needed for designing damage tolerant repairs to meet the stringent damage tolerant requirements inherent in both JSSG2006 and FAA ac-120-107b. It is also shown that the in-service performance of the WPF reinforcement reveals shortcomings in the approach outlined in the US Composite Materials Handbook CMH-17-3G for the design of bonded joints. It is also shown that not only was the WPF reinforcement the first example of the ability of composite repair technology to eliminate cracking in primary structure it was also the first example to highlight the benefit to be gained by combining composite repair technology with shape optimisation or rework."

Unlike the OIV (Organisation Internationale de la Vigne et du Vin) reference method, which is based on flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS), the proposed method does not require any sample preparation. Previous to the development of this method a reappraisal of the possible interferences found during the determination of zinc in wine by the reference OIV method was undertaken. Aiming at minimising sample preparation during FAAS method, alternatives such as the use of matched-matrix standards and the use of the Standard Additions Method (SAM) were studied, however different samples of Tannat wine produced in Uruguay exhibited widely different interference patterns, precluding the possible development of an alternate sample preparation-free FAAS method. Thus a new method based on direct-injection ETAAS was developed. The method is based on the atomic absorption of zinc at the alternate resonance wavelength of 307.6nm. Samples are injected in the graphite furnace without preparation and the determination carried out by SAM. Quantification limit was 0.10mgL−1 and linearity was confirmed in the range 0.10–10mgL−1. Precision (repeatability, sr (%), n=5) was calculated at three concentration levels and found to be better than 5%. When compared with the OIV reference method, results agreed within 10%. The method is fit for the purpose of routine analytical quality control, requiring no sample preparation and thus less labour and producing less chemical waste."

abstract = "Biochar has gained agricultural importance as a soil amendment because of its important agricultural properties such as water retention, plant nutrient supplier, promoter of microorganism growth, sequestration action of atmospheric CO2, etc. Further, it is a low cost material being produced by recycling. Due to its active sites, biochar can adsorb nutrients so acting as a soil fertilizer. Thus the rapid assessment of nutrients in these materials is essential to ensure quality control for agricultural purposes. This work aimed to develop a simple analytical method based on Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) to determine Ca in biochar-based fertilizers. In particular, biochar samples enriched with Ca were prepared from peanut shells, residues of eucalyptus and banana fibers. The calibration standards were prepared by matrix matching using a biochar from eucalyptus residues. Different spectral preprocessing were evaluated to enhance the precision and accuracy of the method. However, the matrix effects demanded the use of internal standardization as the appropriate methodology to obtain the best accuracy. A linear correlation coefficient of 0.989 and a linear work range of 1.51–11.23% Ca were obtained using the proposed method, which yielded limits of detection and quantification of 0.45% e 1.51%, respectively. Calcium contents determined by LIBS in biochar-based fertilizers were in good agreement (paired t-test at 95% confidence level) with those determined by using High-Resolution Continuous Source Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (HR-CS FAAS) as the reference technique. Thus, the importance of internal standardization was demonstrated to be successful for the quantitative analysis of Ca in complex matrices like biochar-based fertilizers."

Two models of remediation (intrinsic bioremediation and phytoremediation) were tested. The metals (Al, Fe, Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn and Ni) were determined employing Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (FAAS). The total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) were analyzed using Gas Cromatograph with Flame Iron Detector (GC-FID). The physical–chemical parameters were monitored for a 90-day period at the pilot scale. The results showed that both techniques were effective at degrading the organic compounds in oil, with phytoremediation (Rizophora mangle) being the most efficient (87% removal). It was also observed that the biodegradation model of intrinsic bioremediation did not have a direct correlation with the concentrations of metals; however, a positive correlation with some metals (Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni) for the model with phytoremediation was verified with the removal of hydrocarbons, showing efficiency at phytoextraction and phytostimulation. The results suggest that red mangroves, through their rhizosphere mechanisms are a promising plant that can be used for the removal of petroleum hydrocarbons in the presence of metals in mangrove sediments."

abstract = "This study aimed to evaluate the heavy metal adsorptivity of calcium-alginate-modified diethylenetriamine-silica gel (CaAD) and incorporate this biosorbent into a flow analytical system for heavy metal ions using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The biosorbent was synthesized by electrostatically coating calcium alginate onto diethylenetriamine (dien)-silica gel. Copper ion adsorption tests by a batch method showed that CaAD exhibited a higher adsorption rate compared with other biosorbents despite its low maximum adsorption capacity. Next, CaAD was packed into a 1mL microcolumn, which was connected to a flow analytical system equipped with an FAAS instrument. The flow system quantitatively adsorbed heavy metals and enriched their concentrations. This quantitative adsorption was achieved for pH 3–4 solutions containing 1.0×10−6M of heavy metal ions at a flow rate of 5.0mLmin−1. Furthermore, the metal ions were successfully desorbed from CaAD at low nitric acid concentrations (0.05–0.15M) than from the polyaminecarboxylic acid chelating resin (Chelex 100). Therefore, CaAD may be considered as a biosorbent that quickly adsorbs and easily desorbs analyte metal ions. In addition, the flow system enhanced the concentrations of heavy metals such as Cu2+, Zn2+, and Pb2+ by 50-fold. This new enrichment system successfully performed the separation and determination of Cu2+ (5.0×10−8M) and Zn2+ (5.7×10−8M) in a river water sample and Pb2+ (3.8×10−9M) in a ground water sample."

abstract = "Although the toxic metal Cd is an established human nephrotoxin, little is known about the role that interactions with plasma constitutents play in determining its mammalian target organs. To gain insight, a Cd–human serum albumin (HSA) complex was analyzed on a system consisting of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled on-line to a flame atomic absorption spectrometer (FAAS). Using phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) as the mobile phase, we investigated the effect of 1–10mM oxidized glutathione (GSSG), l-cysteine (Cys), l-glutathione (GSH), or N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) on the elution of Cd. As expected, GSSG did not mobilize Cd from the Cd–HSA complex up to a concentration of 4mM. With 1.0mM NAC, ∼30% of the injected Cd–HSA complex eluted as such, while the mobilized Cd was lost on the column. With 1.0mM of Cys or GSH, no parent Cd–HSA complex was detected and 88% and 82% of the protein bound Cd eluted close to the elution volume, likely in form of Cd(Cys)2 and a Cd–GSH 1:1 complex. Interestingly, with GSH and NAC concentrations >4.0mM, a Cd double peak was detected, which was rationalized in terms of the elution of a polynuclear Cd complex baseline-separated from a mononuclear Cd complex. In contrast, mobile phases which contained Cys concentrations ≥2mM resulted in the detection of only a single Cd peak, probably Cd(Cys)4. Our results establish SEC–FAAS as a viable tool to probe the mobilization of Cd from binding sites on plasma proteins at near physiological conditions. The detected complexes between Cd and Cys or GSH may be involved in the translocation of Cd to mammalian target organs."

abstract = "This study demonstrates the influence of the solvent when thermospray flame furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (TS-FF-AAS) is employed for the determination of elements of low volatility, taking magnesium (Mg) as leading case. Several organic solvents/water solutions of different characteristics (density, surface tension, viscosity, etc.) and proportions were employed for the TS-FF-AAS analytical determination. To this end, solutions containing methanol, ethanol and isopropanol in water were assayed. Measurements were performed at different acetylene/air ratios of the combustion flame and then, the corresponding response surfaces were obtained. Methanol/water 75% v/v as carrier and a fuel rich flame were found as the most sensitive alternative. In the light of these findings and in order to explain the changes on the analytical signal, the influence of the solvent characteristics, the sample droplet size and the redox environment was studied. An estimation of the temperature of different zones of the heated flame furnace based on a modified signal ratio pyrometry method was analyzed for comparative purposes. A full discussion is provided throughout the paper. Once obtained the best conditions for analysis, Mg was determined in samples of effervescent vitamin tablets comparing two different solvents. The tablets were dissolved in methanol/water 75% v/v and ethanol/water 75% v/v and then, directly introduced in the TS device. The methanol/water 75% v/v dissolution yielded a slightly higher sensitivity when compared to ethanol/water and thus, the latter was selected due to its lower toxicity. The obtained figures of merit are: LOD (3σb): 0.021mgL−1; LOQ (10σb): 0.068mgL−1, sensitivity: 0.086Lmg−1; RSD%: 3.55, dynamic linear range 0.068–5mgL−1. Comparison of the results was performed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS), showing a good agreement (95% confidence level, n=5). Whilst the FAAS approach needed sample mineralization as no complete solubility was attained with both alcohol/water solvents, TS allowed direct introduction of the sample with an excellent recovery of the analyte after spiking. The whole TS procedure was more economic (lower amount of reagents and wastings, lower time of operation) and faster (60h−1 sampling throughput) than FAAS. Nonetheless, the main objective of this work is to show that an analytical signal different from zero can be obtained for Mg via TS by simply choosing the adequate operational variables that allow an optimization of the mass transfer of the analyte into the atomizer and a favorable dynamics of desolvation/atomization. This approach could broad TS analytical capabilities to other elements of lower volatility as it is shown here for the case of Mg."

Despite this limit fleet data and data obtained from full scale fatigue tests reveal that small sub mm initial delaminations/disbonds can grow when subjected to operational flight loads. To account for this the US Federal Aviation Authority advisory circular AC20-107B outlines a slow growth approach for certifying composite/bonded aircraft structures. A key point in AC20-107B is that growth must be both slow and predictable. Since the life of an airframe is determined by the growth of the fastest (lead) crack/delamination/disbond any analysis tool developed for a composite/bonded airframe requires the ability to predict the both the scatter in delamination/disbond growth and thereby the growth of the lead delamination/disbond in the airframe. To this end the present paper reveals that the Hartman-Schijve variant of the NASGRO equation would appear to show promise for capturing the scatter seen in Mode I delamination tests associated with specimens fabricated from nominally identical material supplied by two different suppliers. It is shown that the values of the constants in the Hartman-Schijve equation associated with these two sources are consistent and the scatter in growth can captured by allowing for small variations in the fatigue threshold term."

To correlate the proteome modifications with physiological aspects, growth, serum metabolites (cortisol, glucose, lactate, ALT, AST, and ALP), and liver antioxidant-related parameters (SOD, GPx, CAT, and MDA) were also examined. A total of 1275 fish (average weight of 42.6±2.3g) were stocked into 12 tanks at a density of 80kgm−3. The fish were divided into four groups according to diet: control (basal diet), vit E (500mgkg−1 vit E-supplemented diet), nanoSe (1mgkg−1 nanoSe-supplemented diet), and combination (500mgkg−1 vit E and 1mgkg−1 nanoSe-supplemented diet). After 60days, the best performance and health status of fish were observed in vit E and combination groups. Supplementation with nanoSe had no significant effects on growth performance. In addition, we compared liver proteome profiles of fish fed with a basal diet (control) and diets supplemented with vit E or nanoSe. Among the identified proteins, GRP78, ATPsyn-d, and HSP70 had an increased abundance in the vit E group, while HPPD and GAPDH showed a decreased abundance. In response to nanoSe supplementation, the expression of MDH, FAA, FBPA, TPI, GRHPR, GNMT, FDH, and Enol was increased. The proteomic data indicate that vit E or nanoSe supplementation can alter the expression of proteins involved in metabolic status of rainbow trout reared under high rearing density."

Artemia protein digestibility and retention were determined in order to analyze the ghrelin effect in fed and fasted Senegalese sole post-larvae. Results suggested that ghrelin acts as orexigenic hormone in Senegalese sole, with a response time around 25min. Results indicated that Senegalese sole post-larvae are able to maintain absorption and retention capacities independently of feeding rate and nutritional status.

abstract = "Network Function Virtualization (NFV) orchestration and management have attracted a lot of attention in recent years as it provides new opportunities regarding performance and deployment. In particular, several models have attempted to capture the behavior of such systems under various restricted assumptions. However, previously proposed mathematical models can only handle problems of fairly small size. This paper proposes a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for the resource utilization problem in an NFV dynamic context with several enhancements regarding the state of the art. We include the utilization of flow constraints to ensure the order of functions in a service chain. By systematic generation of Flow Cover inequalities, significant improvements in processing time are obtained with a standard MILP solver to compute exact optimal solutions. We also propose three efficient heuristics (two MILP-based heuristics) to find high-quality feasible solutions for large-scale systems within reduced execution time. We also carry out a set of experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithms and provide valuable guidelines for the efficient design of such systems. The results show that our approach is capable of handling large size instances of the NFV deployment problem involving up to 200 nodes and 100 demands."

This electrolyte enables facile anodic oxidation of FAA monomer at lower potential (1.05V vs. SCE). PFAA films with conductivity of 0.53Scm−1 obtained from this medium showed better redox activity and thermal stability in relation to unsoluble poly(fluorene-9-carboxylic acid).

In this study, we investigated DON in flooded layer and soil solution along soil profiles with suction cups in fertilized paddy fields. The DON concentration showed a relative decrease in the deeper layer of paddy soil, while free amino acid N (FAA-N) exhibited a drastic increase along with nutrient profiles of soil. In the upper layer (0–20 cm), DON accounted for 54–64% of total dissolved N (TDN), but this value increased up to 63–97% in the deeper layer (40–60 cm). Low concentrations (9.6–15.0 μg L−1) of FAA-N and low percentage of FAA-N/DON (0.1–0.2%) were observed in the upper layer, but higher concentrations (111–307 μg L−1) and increased percentage (8–36%) were examined in the deeper layer. The high percentage of DON/TDN indicated that DON was the predominant N pool in the deeper layer. Concentrations of DON were significantly and positively correlated with organic matter, total N, and electrical conductivity (EC), while negatively related to soil pH. Additionally, capillary porosity, air porosity, bulk density and particle density were also found to be significantly associated with DON. We suggest the DON and FAA in the paddy field could be an important source for N leaching, which is most strongly related with soil nutrient profiles and physical properties. It is estimated that a total loss of 4.0 kg N ha−1 yr−1 is potentially linked to DON in the paddy field, which implied that ca. 3.35% of the applied N fertilizers could be lost via DON."

The three procedures of sample preparation has been proposed: sample digestion with the use of hydrofluoric acid for determination of total concentration of elements, extraction by aqua regia for determination of the quasi-total element concentration and extraction by hydrochloric acid solution to determine contents of the elements in acid leachable fraction. The detection limits were on the level 0.001–0.121mgL−1 (from 0.010–0.10 to 1.2–12mgkg−1 depend on the samples preparation procedure); the precision: 0.20–1.37%; accuracy 85–115% (for recovery for certified standards materials analysis and parallel analysis by independent analytical techniques: X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and flame absorption spectrometry (FAAS)). The conformity of the results obtained by MIP–OES analytical procedures with the results obtained by XRF and FAAS analysis allows to propose the procedures for studies of elemental composition of the fraction of the geological samples. Additionally, the MIP–OES technique is much less expensive than ICP techniques and much less time-consuming than AAS techniques."

Fermentation with W. confusa without dextran production decreased thickness, while dextran containing W. confusa samples were similar to the control. Cracker thickness and flour RVA-viscosities showed negative correlation. Non-dextran W. confusa increased final viscosity (1807 cP) and setback viscosity (1200 cP) compared to control flour (1318 cP and 885.5 cP). Both enzyme-types reduced viscosities: e.g. lowest final viscosity was 729.5 cP after protease treatment. Microscopy indicated enhanced gluten network especially after xylanase treatment. Enzyme-treated crackers had neutral flavor and soft structure, as well as increased tendency to break down in the mouth. Fermented crackers were hard and had pungent flavour. Acidification appeared to negate the possible positive impact of dextran on cracker quality."

The evolution of free amino acids (FAA) in Caciocavallo cheeses, made with cow milk (CC) and cow milk mixed with ewe (CE) and goat (CG) milk, was studied throughout ripening. In all Caciocavallo cheeses produced, the total free amino acid (TFAA) content increased during ripening. In general, the highest TFAA content was found in cow cheeses, and the lowest in CG cheeses, whereas CE cheeses ranged over an intermediate level. In all the analyzed samples, during ripening, the content of the individual FAA increased with the exception of arginine. Tyrosine and histidine were found only in CE samples from the middle to the end of ripening. The major FAA found throughout the whole ripening period, in all types of cheese, were leucine, phenylalanine, lysine, valine, asparagine, γ-aminobutyric acid, and ornithine. The TFAA and several AA showed significant differences in ripening time, whereas tyrosine and histidine showed significant differences in kinds of milk."

Recent studies in rodents point out that ghrelin could also act as an input for the circadian system and/or as an output of peripheral food-entrainable oscillators, being involved in the food anticipatory activity (FAA). In this study we pursue the possible interaction of ghrelin with the circadian system in a teleost, the goldfish (Carassius auratus). First, we analyzed if ghrelin is able to modulate the core clock functioning by regulating clock gene expression in fish under a light/dark cycle 12L:12D and fed at 10 am. As expected the acute intraperitoneal (IP) injection of goldfish ghrelin (gGRL[1–19], 44pmol/g bw) induced the expression of hypothalamic orexin. Moreover, ghrelin also induced (∼2-fold) some Per clock genes in hypothalamus and liver. This effect was partially counteracted in liver by the ghrelin antagonist ([D-Lys3]-GHRP-6, 100pmol/g bw). Second, we investigated if ghrelin is involved in daily FAA rhythms. With this aim locomotor activity was studied in response to IP injections (5–10days) of gGRL[1–19] and [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 at the doses above indicated. Ghrelin and saline injected fish showed similar 24h activity patterns. However, ghrelin antagonist treatment abolished the FAA in schedule fed fish under 24h light, suggesting the involvement of the endogenous ghrelin system in this pre-feeding activity. Altogether these results suggest that ghrelin could be acting as an input for the entrainment of the food-entrainable oscillators in the circadian organization of goldfish."

The blade length of the red mutant was shorter than that of a wild-type HG-511 at the first harvest. However, the results of the present study suggest that the red mutant tends to increase the contents of phycoerythrin, total free amino acid (FAA), alanine and taurine in comparison with the wild type. These tendencies toward the FAA contents were strongly supported by the laboratory culture experiment. From these superior characteristics of pigment and FAA contents, the red mutant IBY-R1 may become a new cultivar in nori cultivation, although it is possible that the mutant harvest will be lower than that of other cultivars."

The high catalytic activity was attributed a combination of factors including the poor crystallinity, the high surface areas (≥163m2g−1), porosity, presence of Mn4+ species, and compositional homogeneity of the synthesized copper manganese oxides. Incorporation of copper into the amorphous manganese oxide matrix significantly enhanced the catalytic activity of the resultant bimetallic oxides by increasing the reducibility and ease of removal of lattice oxygen species.

While it is well established that the biogeochemical cycle of Cd involves its complexation with environment-derived ligands (e.g., humic acids, HAs) and anthropogenic ones (e.g., chelating agents, CAs), the interaction of Cd with both of these ligands is less well understood. To gain insight, a HA–Cd complex was injected on a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) column coupled on-line with a flame atomic absorption spectrometer (FAAS) using 10mmol/L Tris buffer (pH8.0) as the mobile phase. This approach allowed us to observe the intact HA–Cd complex and the retention behavior of Cd as a function of 2–20μmol/L concentrations of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) or methylglycinediacetic acid (MGDA) that were added to the mobile phase. An increase of the retention time of Cd was indicative of a partial or complete abstraction of Cd from HA. Our results revealed that all CAs abstracted Cd from the HA–Cd complex at concentrations of 5μmol/L, while MGDA and DTPA were effective at 2μmol/L. The bioavailability of some of the on-column formed CA–Cd complexes explains the previously reported increased accumulation of Cd in periphyton in the ecosystem downstream of wastewater treatment plants. In addition, our results imply that the use of effluents which contain CAs and Cd for the irrigation of food crops can introduce Cd into the food supply and compromise food safety."

Total metal contents of the soil were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (FAAS) and the data generated were analyzed statistically. Spatial mapping of the distribution of heavy metals was done through the use of Inverse Distance Weighted technique (IDW) of ArcGIS 10. The results showed that the contamination domain of Cd was in the extreme domain while Pb and Cu levels in the soil were in the severe and moderate contamination domains. Zn and Cr posed no potential environmental hazard because of their low level in the soil. The spatial mapping of the heavy metals indicated Pb and Cu enrichment of the soil not only to come from cement production activities but also from vehicular activities while Cd enrichment of the soil was mainly from the cement production. Mapping of Zn and Cr distribution showed that their enrichments in the soil were from cement production activities. From these findings, it is highly recommended that environmental auditing of the cement production line be carried out to reduce the release of pollutants. It is also important that remediation activities be carried out on the soil to reduce the levels of Cd, Pb and Cu to avert potential ecological disasters."

Refeeding subsequent to transient fasting revealed that refeeding but not fasting remarkably induces Fgf21 expression in eWAT, although fasting-induced hepatic Fgf21 expression is completely reversed by refeeding. The free-running period of locomotor activity rhythm under ALF and the food anticipatory activity (FAA) under RF remained intact in Fgf21 knockout (KO) mice, suggesting that FGF21 is dispensable for both the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the food-entrainable oscillator that governs the FAA. Temporal expression profiles of circadian genes such as mPer2 and BMAL1 were essentially identical in both tissues between WT and Fgf21 KO mice under RF. The physiological role of the refeeding-induced adipose Fgf21 expression remains to be elucidated."

We recently established a mouse model of a psychophysiological stress-induced chronic sleep disorder (CSD) characterized by reduced amplitude of circadian wheel-running activity and sleep–wake cycles, sleep fragmentation and hyperphagia. Here, we evaluate day–night fluctuations in plasma concentrations of free amino acids (FAA), appetite hormones and prolactin as well as the hepatic expression of circadian clock-related genes in mice with CSD (CSD mice). Nocturnal increases in wheel-running activity and circadian rhythms of plasma prolactin concentrations were significantly disrupted in CSD mice. Hyperphagia with a decreased leptin/ghrelin ratio was found in CSD mice. Day–night fluctuations in plasma FAA contents were severely disrupted without affecting total FAA levels in CSD mice. Nocturnal increases in branched-chain amino acids such as Ile, Leu, and Val were further augmented in CSD mice, while daytime increases in Gly, Ala, Ser, Thr, Lys, Arg, His, Tyr, Met, Cys, Glu, and Asn were significantly attenuated. Importantly, the circadian expression of hepatic clock genes was completely unaffected in CSD mice. These findings suggest that circadian clock gene expression does not always reflect disordered behavior and sleep rhythms and that plasma FFA profiles could serve as a potential biomarker of circadian rhythm disorders."

Elements were quantified by high-resolution continuum source flame (HR-CS-FAAS) and graphite furnace (HR-CS-GFAAS) atomic absorption spectrometry, while phosphorous was evaluated by a standard vanadomolybdophosphoric acid colorimetric method. Instant coffees and coffee substitutes are rich in K, Mg and P (>100mg/100g dw), contain Na, Ca and Fe in moderate amounts (>1mg/100g), and trace levels of Cr and Ni. Among the samples analysed, plain instant coffees are richer in minerals (p<0.001), except for Na and Cr. Blends of coffee substitutes (barley, malt, chicory and rye) with coffee (20–66%) present intermediate amounts, while lower quantities are found in substitutes without coffee, particularly in barley. From a nutritional point of view the results indicate that the mean ingestion of two instant beverages per day (total of 4g instant powder), either with or without coffee, cannot be regarded as important sources of minerals to the human diet, although providing a supplementation of some minerals, particularly Mg and Mn in instant coffees. Additionally, and for authentication purposes, the correlations observed between some elements and the coffee percentage in the blends, with particular significance for Mg amounts, provides a potential tool for the estimation of coffee in substitute blends."

A full factorial design in two levels was applied to evaluate the impact of significant variables for all elements to determine optimal experimental conditions. A desirability function revealed these to be: 2.0g sample mass, 8mL of HNO3 and 8min of heating time in the IR system. Precision better than 10% (RSD) was obtained, superior to that of a combined IR-MW approach. Sample preparation based on IR-assisted digestion provides a rapid and inexpensive alternative to other conventional techniques for the analysis of complex samples and is able to accommodate relatively large masses of sample, alleviating potential homogeneity issues as well as enhancing detection power."

Although the anatomical substrates and underlying mechanisms of the food-entrainable oscillator are not well understood, experimental evidence indicates that it involves multiple structures and systems. Using rabbit pups entrained to circadian nursing as a natural model of food restriction, we hypothesized that the anterior piriform cortex (APCx) and the olfactory tubercle (OTu) are activated during nursing-associated FAA. Two groups of litters were entrained to one of two different nursing times. At postnatal day 7, when litters showed clear FAA, pups from each litter were euthanized at nursing time, or 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 or 20h later. Neural metabolic activities of the APCx, OTu, olfactory bulb (OB) and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) were assessed by cytochrome oxidase histochemistry. Additionally, two fasted groups were nurse-deprived for two cycles before being euthanized at postnatal day 9. In nursed pups, metabolic activity of APCx, OTu and OB increased during FAA and after feeding, independently of the geographical time. Metabolic activity in SCN was not affected by nursing schedule. Given that APCx and OTu are in a key network position to integrate temporal odor signals with body energetic state, brain arousal and reward mechanisms, we suggest that these structures could be an important part of the conditioned oscillatory mechanism that leads to food entrainment."

Flight crews make decisions all the time, from the captain's acceptance of the aircraft and flight plan prior to departure to docking at the gate after landing. Unfortunately, the decisions that get the most attention are those that result in disasters. Because decision-making takes mental energy and because a large body of research suggests that people do not always make optimal decisions, aircraft designers, carriers, and the FAA try to simplify crew decision-making by establishing standard procedures and checklists to cover anticipated failures or emergencies, and through crew training and automated systems. This chapter discusses the processes by which flight crews make decisions and addresses factors that contribute to decision difficulty and poor decisions, followed by factors that provide crew resilience in the face of high-risk challenges. Finally, it explores strategies for improving crew decision-making. Designing information displays to support good situation awareness and accurate problem diagnosis is a theme of current research and development efforts. Providing information on risks is more problematic. Mutual trust, respect, and a positive crew climate will continue to be the foundation for effective crew decision- making in future automated systems."

In this paper the influence of basic pH on amino acid racemization and leaching of aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), serine (Ser), and alanine (Ala) in freshwater mollusk shell is addressed. Shell fragments of modern Margaritifera falcata were immersed in buffered solutions of pH 7, 8, 9, and 10, and heated at 110 °C for eight time intervals ranging from 1 to 160 d. In addition, a suite of samples was subjected to extensive bleaching to isolate the intra-crystalline fraction of amino acids following heating in the buffer solutions. A total of 376 shell samples and 132 buffer solutions were analyzed for Asp, Glu, Ser, and Ala D/L values and concentrations, for both the total hydrolysable amino acids (THAA) and the free amino acid (FAA) populations. The results show that D/L values increase with increasing pH. Shells heated in pH 7 solution yielded the lowest D/L values, followed by pH 8 and 9 with overlapping, intermediate D/L values, and shells heated in pH 10 solution showed the highest D/L values. The effect of pH differed for each amino acid. For example, for Asp, D/L values were 29% higher in shells heated in pH 10 solution compared with pH 7, and for Glu, D/L values were 134% higher. The production of FAA increased with pH, following the same pattern as the D/L values. The intra-crystalline fraction showed similar results to the unbleached samples, suggesting that the effect of solution pH permeated the carbonate crystals. Trends in the percentage of leached FAA and THAA amino acids proved useful in tracking which amino acids were leached fastest (FAA Ser) and the most abundantly (FAA Ser and FAA Ala). Because the pH of pore fluids within shell CaCO3 naturally stabilizes at pH 8, and because our data show little difference in the rate of racemization between pH 8 and 9, we suggest that pH has a significant influence on racemization in shells only where the pH of the pore fluid is >9."

abstract = "A new dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (DLLME) method is proposed for rapid separation, simultaneous extraction and preconcentration of gold and palladium at ultra trace amounts. The extraction of the analytes was performed in the presence of 5-[(E)-(2,6-diaminopyridine-3-yl)diazenyl]-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-thiol (DAT) as chelating agent. Chloroform and acetone were used as extraction and dispersive solvents, respectively. The variables affecting the complexation and extraction conditions were optimized. The calibration curves were linear in the range of 1.1–85 and 0.9–124μgL−1 with the detection limits of 0.4 and 0.6μgL−1, and with the enrichment factors of 94 and 113 for Au and Pd, respectively. The precision (RSD%) was better than 2.4%. The accuracy of the method was verified by analysing the certified standard reference material (CDN–PGMS-10). The results show that the dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction pretreatment is a sensitive, rapid, simple and safe method for the separation/preconcentration of gold and palladium."

abstract = "Coffee is one of the most popular drinks across the world and its enormous commercial and social importance is obvious. The levels of nine bioactive amines and five minerals, as well as pH, color, total ash and dry matter characteristics, were determined in different brands of ground and brewed Turkish coffees for the first time. Turkish coffee is a method of preparation, not a kind of coffee. Furthermore, this paper reported the estimated daily mineral intake of five elements. The amines were extracted with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and quantified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), pre-column derivatization with benzoyl chloride. Of the nine bioactive amines under study putrescine, cadaverine, tyramine and serotonin were detected in all coffee samples. Serotonin was the prevailing bioactive amine in both ground and brewed coffees. The total amine levels in the ground coffee varied from 126.0mg/kg to 352.2mg/kg. The total amine levels in the brewed coffee varied from 5.679mg/L to 48.88mg/L. The concentrations of five minerals (Mg, Mn, Zn, Na, K) were determined after dry mineralization of both ground and brewed coffee samples. The total mineral contents were analyzed by high-resolution continuum source flame atomic absorption spectrometry (HR-CS-FAAS). Potassium was the prevailing mineral in both ground and brewed coffees. The mean total mineral contents of ground and brewed coffees were 12673.2mg/kg and 1014.8mg/L, respectively. Significant differences were obtained between bioactive amines, minerals (except Na), color values (L*, a*, b*), total ash and total dry matter contents of ground and brewed Turkish coffee samples (P<0.05)."

As such, T-differential algebras are axiomatized by the chain rule and as a consequence we obtain both the higher-order Leibniz rule and the Faà di Bruno formula for the higher-order chain rule. We also construct both free and cofree T-differential algebras for suitable codifferential categories and discuss power series of T-algebras."

In order to explore the phenomena, laboratory-scale constant-volume combustion experiments were performed. The maximum explosion pressure and burning velocity were measured for methane–air flames with added CF3Br (Halon 1301), C6F12O (Novec 1230), C3H2F3Br (2-BTP), and C2HF5 (HFC-125). The explosion pressure, for initially stoichiometric flames, was increased mildly (up to 11% and 6%) with C6F12O and C2HF5 added at low concentrations, while at lean conditions (Φ=0.6), it was increased about 50% for added C6F12O, C3H2F3Br, or C2HF5, at agent volume fractions Xa=0.02, 0.03, and 0.06. The burning velocity for initially stoichiometric flames was always decreased with addition of any of the agents, whereas, for the lean conditions, it increased with added C6F12O or C2HF5 (32% and 14%, at Xa=0.01 and 0.03). Burning velocities at higher initial pressure (3bar) and temperature (400K) showed lower inhibition effectiveness (than at ambient conditions) for the stoichiometric flames, and larger enhancement for the lean flames (and the effect was due primarily to the temperature increase). CF3Br did not increase the explosion pressure or burning velocity for any of the tested conditions. Equilibrium calculations were used to interpret the experiments. The present work is consistent with the FAA results and previous analysis of the full-scale tests."

The aviation industry (airlines and repair stations), federal agencies (the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)), and the academic community came together to study specific safety issues in the technical operations environment (line and base maintenance facilities, maintenance, repair, and overhaul-MRO-facilities, as well as ramp operations). The FAA and NASA funded this research, university faculty members and students conducted the research activities, and the industry partners provided access to facilities and personnel. At an international level, the FAA and NASA, Transport Canada, and United Kingdom. Civil Aviation Authority participated in another three-way partnership that enabled information sharing among the researchers, regulators, and practitioners. This chapter also reviews some of the most commonly used incident review tools and the associated taxonomies. With the increased use of structured approach to incident investigation, the use of MRM programs moved from simple awareness programs to reactive error-correction programs, and subsequently matured to proactive, error-avoidance programs, paving the way for predictive trend analysis programs. Finally, this chapter reviews the influence of MRM programs on the safety culture in technical operations and identifies some emerging opportunities for continued research and development."

Current analytical lab methods to determine water quality include flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS), atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS), electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (EAAS), and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy. However only two field methods, colorimetry and absorptiometry, exist for elemental analysis of water. Portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) spectrometry is an effective method for elemental analysis of soil, sediment, and other matrices. However, the accuracy of PXRF is known to be affected while scanning moisture-laden soil samples. This study sought to statistically establish PXRF’s predictive ability for various elements in water at different concentrations relative to inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). A total of 390 metal-laden water samples collected from leaching columns of mine tailings in South Africa were analyzed via PXRF and ICP-AES. The PXRF showed differential effectiveness in elemental quantification. For the collected water samples, the best relationships between ICP and PXRF elemental data were obtained for K and Cu (R2 = 0.92). However, when scanning ICP calibration solutions with elements in isolation, PXRF results indicated near perfect agreement; Ca, K, Fe, Cu and Pb produced an R2 of 0.99 while Zn and Mn produced an R2 of 1.00. The utilization of multiple PXRF (stacked) beams produced stronger correlation to ICP relative to the use of a single beam in isolation. The results of this study demonstrated the PXRF's ability to satisfactorily predict the composition of metal-laden water as reported by ICP for several elements. Additionally this study indicated the need for a “Water Mode” calibration for the PXRF and demonstrates the potential of PXRF for future study of polluted or contaminated waters."

La dépression est une maladie hétérogène, au niveau clinique et physiopathologique. La recherche de biomarqueurs des troubles affectifs apporterait une meilleure compréhension des mécanismes sous-jacents et améliorerait la prise en charge. L’asymétrie de l’activité frontale de la bande de fréquence alpha (frontal alpha asymmetry [FAA]) basale est une mesure psychophysiologique issue de l’analyse spectrale de la bande de fréquence alpha à partir d’électroencéphalogrammes. Elle serait une mesure stable de la motivation (d’approche avec une hyperactivité frontale gauche relative et de retrait avec une hyperactivité droite frontale relative) et des émotions. Elle témoignerait aussi de dispositions individuelles émotionnelles et comportementales, et d’une vulnérabilité psychopathologique à la dépression [1]. Une hyperactivité frontale droite (ou une hypoactivité gauche) relative basale serait associée à la dépression, particulièrement au site frontal médian F3/F4 [2], malgré une certaine inconsistance de la littérature.
Méthode
Nous avons mesuré la FAA (calcul de la différence de puissance alpha entre 2 électrodes homologues) au site frontal médian F3/F4, dans un groupe de patients déprimés et un groupe contrôle. Nous attendions une différence significative entre ces 2 groupes, dans le sens d’une hypoactivité frontale gauche relative dans le groupe de patients.
Résultats
Nous avons retrouvé une différence significative de FAA entre les 2 groupes, au site F3/F4 mais avec un pattern d’asymétrie opposé à celui attendu (hyperactivité corticale frontale gauche relative dans le groupe de patients).
Conclusion
Le pattern d’asymétrie retrouvé est en faveur d’une augmentation de la motivation d’approche. Il est similaire au pattern d’asymétrie de patients souffrant de troubles bipolaires [3]. Le pattern qui était attendu dans le groupe de patients déprimés signait une diminution de la motivation d’approche, et donc une baisse de la sensibilité à la récompense dans la dépression (anhédonie) [4]."

abstract = "The behaviour of soluble nitrogen compounds during Grana Padano cheese-making was studied at eight dairies. Raw milk, skimmed milk, sweet whey and the derived natural whey culture, collected from 24 processes, were analysed for soluble whey proteins (α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin), proteose-peptones (PP), small peptides (SP), caseinomacropeptides (CMPs), and free amino acids (FAAs). The PP fraction increased during milk natural creaming, then part of it was selectively retained in the curd and the rest degraded in the first few hours of whey fermentation, together with α-lactalbumin, CMPs and part of SP. Features outlined for the whey culture were confirmed on 30 samples collected at six different dairies. A time course study of the whey fermentation showed that degradation of α-lactalbumin began when the pH dropped below 4, whereas β-lactoglobulin content did not change. Uptake of specific FAAs was shown to support the initial growth of lactic acid bacteria in whey."

This paper discusses and reviews the evaluation method for the expert judgment from the two aspects: the validation of each expert judgment and the coefficient of agreement as a group, and gets certain feedbacks though an application of the method in a Chinese aircraft type."

Several parameters that could affect the extraction efficiency of the method were studied such as the influence of surfactant (Triton X-114) and acid (HNO3) in the extractant solution. Also, operating parameters of the spectrometer (flame stoichiometry and observation height) were evaluated in order to allow sensitive measurements of Ca, Mg and Co in the same conditions. Quantitative extraction of the analytes can be obtained by using 20mL of biodiesel and 4mL of a solution containing 2.1molL−1HNO3 and 7.5% m/v Triton X-114. In these conditions, the emulsions can be broken in 10min of heating at 90°C. The limits of quantification for Ca and Mg were 0.047 and 0.013μgmL−1, respectively.

abstract = "New architectural patterns (e.g. microservices), the massive adoption of Linux containers (e.g. Docker containers), and improvements in key features of Cloud computing such as auto-scaling, have helped developers to decouple complex and monolithic systems into smaller stateless services. In turn, Cloud providers have introduced serverless computing, where applications can be defined as a workflow of event-triggered functions. However, serverless services, such as AWS Lambda, impose serious restrictions for these applications (e.g. using a predefined set of programming languages or difficulting the installation and deployment of external libraries). This paper addresses such issues by introducing a framework and a methodology to create Serverless Container-aware ARchitectures (SCAR). The SCAR framework can be used to create highly-parallel event-driven serverless applications that run on customized runtime environments defined as Docker images on top of AWS Lambda. This paper describes the architecture of SCAR together with the cache-based optimizations applied to minimize cost, exemplified on a massive image processing use case. The results show that, by means of SCAR, AWS Lambda becomes a convenient platform for High Throughput Computing, specially for highly-parallel bursty workloads of short stateless jobs."

Developmental phases were fixed in FAA and processed for observation with the scanning electron microscope. Spores of both species are monolete; Vittaria-type germination and Aspidium-type prothallial development were observed. In the phase of development, the gametophytes develop unicellular secretory and as they mature, develop bifurcated or branched pluricellular trichomes, both in the cushion and near the meristematic zone. Adult gametophytes in culture are cordiform-spatulate to cordiform-reniform, most are unisexual and a few are bisexual. Gametangia belong to the leptosporangiate fern type. Archegonial morphology is uniform, with an elongate, thin neck curved toward the base of the gametophyte. Antheridia have a basal cell, an annular cell and an undivided opercular cell. Three hundred days after the spores were sown, sporophytes still had not developed. In both species, some spores germinate inside the sporangial capsule (intra-sporangial germination). We provide new information on morphogenesis in the genus Platycerium."

Many different analytical methods including UV–visible spectrophotometry, spectrofluorimetry, atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (AFS), chromatography, flameless atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS), electrochemistry, and inductively coupled plasma with atomic emission (ICP-AES) or mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) are available for quantification of selenium levels in different matrices. In recent years, analytical speciation techniques made a great leap in separating and detecting low levels of Se, but analyzing reduced species such as Se(0), polyselenides, and sulfur–selenium mixed species in the environment need further development. A number of selenium compounds has been identified in biota, but positive identification of such compounds in environmental samples is needed to understand the speciation of selenium in natural waters, sediments, and soils."

MAA was degraded rapidly to FAA and AA, while phenazone was not degraded under the prevailing conditions even after 32 h. By operating the bioreactor in batch mode to study the phenazone degradation potential of the biofilm under limiting nutrient conditions, an elimination rate of 85% phenazone was observed, but because of the slow elimination rate and aerobic conditions, the metabolite DP was not detected. In additional batch experiments using bacterial isolates from the natural biofilm to decompose phenazone, some bacterial strains were able to form DP from phenazone in marginal concentrations over the sampling period of eight weeks. Obviously, the microorganisms need a reasonably long time to adapt their metabolisms to enable the removal of phenazone from water samples."

abstract = "Background
The purpose of this experience was to define patient characteristics, aneurysm anatomy and presentation, types of utilized repair options, and temporal changes over 2 decades in the management of femoral artery aneurysms (FAAs).
Methods
Between January 1988 and December 2009, 27 patients with a total of 35 true FAAs were analyzed. Histologic examination was obtained for all the operated FAAs. Postoperative follow-up included clinical and radiologic examinations every 6 months in the first year and once per year thereafter.
Results
There were 25 men; mean age was 65 ± 19 years. Aneurysms involved the common femoral artery in 20 cases (57%), the superficial femoral artery in 9 cases (26%), and the profunda femoris artery in 6 cases (17%). Seven patients (26%) had bilateral aneurysms, and 13 patients (48%) had additional aneurysms. Overall, 10 FAAs (29%) were symptomatic. Mean aneurysm diameter was 46 ± 19 mm. Three patients with four aneurysms were not operated on, and 31 aneurysms were finally operated on. Intensive care unit admission was never needed and hospital mortality was not registered. Major complications occurred in 3 cases (3 of 31; 8.5%) only. Amputations were never performed. Mean follow-up was 56 ± 49 months. No graft thrombosed and only a late (6 months) anastomotic pseudoaneurysm was detected and treated with an endograft. Patients' survival was 93% ± 0.5% at 6 months, 88.6% ± 0.6% at 1 year, and 77.6% ± 1.2% at 5 years.
Conclusion
FAAs have been uncommon and rarely isolated lesions. Surgical repair offered good results either in elective or urgent settings."

Because specific FAAs interact with cannabinoid and vanilloid receptors, they are often referred to as ‘endocannabinoids’ or ‘endovanilloids’. Initial interest in this area, therefore, has focused on developing FAAH inhibitors to augment the actions of FAAs and reduce pain. However, recent literature has shown that these FAAs – through interactions with unique receptors (extracellular and intracellular) – can induce a diverse array of effects that include appetite suppression, modulation of lipid and glucose metabolism, vasodilation, cardiac function and inflammation. This review gives an overview of FAAs and diverse FAAH inhibitors and their potential therapeutic utility in pain and non-pain indications."

abstract = "The opaque2 (o2) mutation in maize (Zea mays L.) increases the content of free amino acids (FAA) in the endosperm. We investigated the basis of this trait by using recombinant inbred lines from a cross of Oh545o2 (high FAA) and Oh51Ao2 (low FAA) to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for FAA content and to determine their effect on FAA composition and protein accumulation. Mapping identified six QTLs that accounted for 71% of the phenotypic variation. Two QTLs in bins 4.01 and 7.02 are close to α-zein genes; high FAA individuals with these QTLs had reduced accumulation of α-zein 19 kDa isoforms and increased FAA abundant in α-zeins. A QTL in bin 3.03 is close to a gene encoding triose phosphate isomerase (tpi4) and a higher expression of this enzyme was found in high FAA individuals. Other differentially expressed proteins included vicilin-like globulins and the enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase-2, sorbitol dehydrogenase and granule-bound starch synthase. The results suggest that the increased levels of FAA in o2 endosperm are mainly due to the reduction of storage proteins and the failure to incorporate their amino acids into other proteins, as well as the alteration of carbohydrate metabolism that may favor amino acid biosynthesis."

La faringoamigdalitis aguda (FAA) es una de las enfermedades más comunes en la infancia. La etiología más frecuente es vírica. Entre las causas bacterianas, el principal agente responsable es Streptococcus pyogenes o estreptococo beta hemolítico del grupo A (EbhGA). Las escalas de valoración clínica son una buena ayuda para seleccionar a qué niños se deben practicar las técnicas de detección rápida de antígeno estreptocócico (TDR) y/o el cultivo de muestras faringoamigdalares. Sin su empleo, se tiende al sobrediagnóstico de FAA estreptocócica, con la consiguiente prescripción innecesaria de antibióticos, muchas veces de amplio espectro. Los objetivos del tratamiento son: acelerar la resolución de los síntomas, reducir el tiempo de contagio y prevenir las complicaciones supurativas locales y no supurativas. Idealmente, solo deben tratarse los casos confirmados. En caso de no disponibilidad de la TDR, o en algunos casos, ante un resultado negativo, se recomienda obtener cultivo e iniciar tratamiento a la espera de los resultados, solo si la sospecha clínica es alta. Los antibióticos de elección para el tratamiento de la FAA estreptocócica son penicilina y amoxicilina. Amoxicilina-clavulánico no está indicado de forma empírica en la infección aguda. Los macrólidos tampoco son un tratamiento de primera elección; su uso debe reservarse para pacientes con alergia inmediata a penicilina o como tratamiento erradicador, en los casos indicados. Es urgente y prioritario en nuestro país adecuar la prescripción de antibióticos a la evidencia científica disponible.
Acute tonsillopharyngitis is one of the most common childhood diseases. Viruses are the most frequent origin. Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) is the main bacterial cause. A culture or a rapid antigen-detection test of a throat-swab specimen should only be done on the basis of clinical scores, in order to avoid over-diagnosis of bacterial origin and unnecessary antibiotic prescription. The objectives of treatment are: the reduction of symptoms, reduce the contagious period, and prevent local suppurative and systemic complications. Ideally, only confirmed cases should receive antibiotics. If there is no possibility to perform a rapid antigen-detection test, or in some cases if the result is negative, it is recommended to perform a culture and, if there is high suspicious index, to prescribe antibiotics. Penicillin is the treatment of choice, although amoxicillin is also accepted as the first option. Amoxicillin/clavulanate is not indicated in any case as empirical treatment. Macrolides are not a first choice antibiotic, and should be reserved for those patients with immediate penicillin allergy reaction or for the treatment of streptococcal carriers. It is of primordial importance to adapt the prescribing of antibiotics to the scientific evidence."

Consequently, European authorities have stated that salt content has to be clearly indicated on the food labels. In order to choose one protocol to determine the sodium content, three preparation methods (dispersion in water, wet digestion and dry ashing) and four analytical techniques (flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS), flame atomic emission spectrometry (FAES), inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and thermometric endpoint titrimetry (TET)) have been compared. As indirect methods based on the assay of chloride could lead to wrong results, especially when food additives are involved in the recipes, it was chosen not to include them in this study. After an evaluation of analytical parameters, each combination, preparation mode and analytical technique, was tested with samples of tomato ketchup sauce. If all of them can fit to the purpose (recovery rates close to 100% and low dispersion of the results), two possibilities were pointed out: dry ashing with FAAS and the dispersion combined with TET."

An optimized HPLC method was developed for efficient analysis of 5′-mononucleotides. Using multiple response optimization approach, optimum conditions required for extraction of total FAAs, total 5′-mononucleotides and total umami compounds were determined. The highest recovery of FAAs was obtained when mushrooms were extracted at room temperature for 180min, while the highest 5′-mononucleotides were recovered by extracting at 70°C for 30min. Based on the desirability function, the optimal parameters of temperature, time and solvent volume for simultaneous recovery of umami components were found to be 70°C, 30min and 50mL, respectively.

abstract = "Airports are complex environments where the operational conditions are subjected to different risks, both due to the intrinsic nature of the manoeuvres themselves and to the external factors, as for human actions or environmental causes. An important risk factor is the presence of temporary hazards on the runway or taxiway safety area, including work in progress related to maintenance or construction operations. Both ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) and FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) defined their own approach on this topic. The FAA, in the Advisory Circular “Operational Safety on Airports During Construction”, states the impossibility of any construction activities within the safety area when the runway is active, while the ICAO, in the Doc 9137 “Airport Service Manual” Part 6, states specific operational restrictions for the airport which allow the presence of temporary hazard in the safety area. This paper analyses the impact of temporary hazards (for example worksites) in the safety areas, according to ICAO requirements, by using a performance approach. The method has been applied to an international airport, using the software RSARA e LRSARA, provided by ACRP (The Airport Cooperative Research Program), in order to calculate the expected risk level within the safety area. This method provides a rapid and practical evaluation of risk level, according to the ICAO Safety Management System approach, in order to optimize the maintenance operation and construction in the safety area, minimizing the closing time of the runway. The main aim of this study is to verify if, under temporary restrictive operational condition (such as the limitation on available runway length and on traffic mix and weather conditions) related to the temporary hazard presence, it is possible to guarantee sufficient safety level, without occurring in runway closures. From the analysis arose that the first factor that affects the risk level for a runway is the temporary hazard dimension: while the environmental conditions (crosswind and pavement conditions) have a minor effect."

The preconcentration factor was 280 (for 1400mL of sample solution and flow rate of 10mLmin−1) and detection limit of the proposed method was found in the range of 0.06–0.49μgL−1. The developed method was successfully applied to the determination of Mn(II), Fe(III) and Cu(II) ions in leaves of spinach, honey, hair, blood and various water samples."

The method is based on the adsorption of cobalt and nickel ions in alkaline media on polyethylene glycol–silica gel in a mini-column, elution with nitric acid and determination by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The adsorption conditions such as NaOH concentration, sample volume and amount of adsorbent were optimized in order to achieve highest sensitivity. The calibration graph was linear in the range of 0.5–200.0ngmL−1 for Co(II) and 2.0–100.0ngmL−1 for Ni(II) in the initial solution. The limit of detection based on 3Sb was 0.37ngmL−1 for Co(II) and 0.71ngmL−1 for Ni(II). The relative standard deviations (R.S.D.) for ten replicate measurements of 40ngmL−1 of Co(II), and Ni(II) were 3.24 and 3.13%, respectively.

To assay the aminobiogenic capacity of the strains, both a qualitative assay, using a synthetic medium, and a quantitative assay, using wort and beer, were carried out and contents of different BA and free amino acids (FAA) were measured by RP-HPLC. Presence in strains of tdc, hdc, odc and ldc decarboxylase genes was assayed by multiplex PCR. Tyramine was the only BA produced by all the strains in the qualitative assay while the 90% did it significantly in wort and beer. Concentrations of the remaining BA analyzed did not change significantly. In contrast, all the strains harboured the tdc, hdc, odc decarboxylases genes. Total BA content in the beers ranged between 30.3 and 48.3 mg/L. None of the strains produced any significant change in total FAA content in wort or beer."

Besides, a statistical approach was conducted using multivariate statistical analysis. The significant differences observed between manufacturing batches, both in the content of free amino acids and biogenic amines, reveal a lack of homogeneity in the production, probably caused by the craft brewing process. A great variability among samples was observed in terms of their content in free amino acids. The main biogenic amine was putrescine, followed by tyramine and histamine; however, the concentrations were below those considered as toxic in alcoholic beverages. Strong negative correlations (P < 0.001) were found between pH and some biogenic amines. The differences in the amino acid profile and the content of biogenic amines in beer samples seem to be more related to the raw materials and to the brewery than to the type of brewing.

UAVs have deployed throughout the US airspace system at rates faster than government can effectively regulate. Challenges include small UAVs operating near airports, by individuals who perhaps do not understand or abide by the regulations on such operations; and large UAVs that can present greater operational and safety challenges to airports and aircraft. Alternatively, UAVs also represent a significant potential source of revenue for airports. In addition to the adoption of UAVs, advancing technology and the cessation of the US Space Shuttle have opened new opportunities for the private commercial space industry operating at commercial airports. Several US airports have been designated or are seeking status as FAA-certified spaceports (see included case study of Front Range Airport, Denver, Colorado). There have been several flight tests of spacecraft designed to eventually take space tourists on suborbital flights. Commercial launch missions have been successful at servicing the International Space Station. Parallel to these innovations, it is vital that operational personnel and emergency Incident Commanders improve their understanding of psychological dynamics during high-risk/high-stress operations. Continuous improvement and delivery of training and exercises for operational personnel and emergency responders are now an absolute requirement in all areas of the aviation and aerospace industries."

After 30days in each treatment, oxygen consumption and weight were recorded, together with hemolymph levels of glucose, sodium, potassium, and free amino acids (FAA). Glycogen level was determined in hepatopancreas and abdominal muscle, while FAA levels were measured in abdominal muscle and hemolymph. A significant decrease of weight gain was seen at the combination of 20°C and 10g/L salinity. A marked hyperglycemia was seen at the lower temperature, at any salinity tested. At the same temperature, there was a concomitant decrease of glycogen, in both hepatopancreas and muscle. Both sodium and potassium hemolymphatic levels significantly increased with increasing salinity, but only at 20°C. No changes were seen in hemolymphatic FAA levels, but they increased in abdominal muscle at higher salinities, in correspondence with the sodium hemolymphatic increase, in order to regulate cellular osmolarity. Although advanced juveniles of C. quadricarinatus did not exhibit reduced survival or growth at 20°C or 10g/L salinity, the combination of relatively low temperature and high salinity significantly reduces growth, suggesting that the combination of these two factors is a stressful condition for these crayfish juveniles."

A significant, gradual body mass loss occurred under nitrogen (8.36 ± 0.85% final weight loss) but no significant loss occurred under humid air (4.92 ± 2.67% final weight loss). Emersion duration and the mantle cavity fluid (MCF) total ammonia (TA) concentration showed a positive, linear relationship (r2 = 0.73 and 0.74 under humid air and N2, respectively). The MCF TA and trimethylamine (TMA) contents were also positively related (r2 = 0.64 and 0.69 under humid air and N2, respectively). Proline was the most abundant soft tissue free amino acid (71.07 ± 11.8%) in the control group and its concentration did not change significantly under either treatment. The concentration of alanine and valine increased significantly only under humid air. Under N2, the concentrations of valine and lysine increased significantly and aspartate decreased significantly. Succinate showed a large increase during the first 6 h of emersion under both treatments but significantly more was accumulated in the N2-exposed group (4.2-fold increase and 8.1-fold increase for the humid air- and N2-exposed groups, respectively). The succinate concentration difference remained higher in the N2-treated groups but, in the final 24 h, levels decreased again (quadratic regressions of r2 = 0.97 and 0.95 under humid air and N2, respectively). Although the trend of succinate accumulation was similar under both treatments, the groups held under nitrogen did not gape (whereas those under humid air did). It is concluded that the implications of gaping behaviour on succinate accumulation in the initial hours of emersion have considerable ecological significance for oysters which occupy habitats in which they may become emersed for some hours naturally. Gaping behaviour also has considerable commercial implications because emersion occurs frequently during the marketing of live oysters."

Un faux anévrysme artériel (FAA) est la formation d’un hématome pulsatile et encapsulé, en communication avec la lumière d’une artère perforée. Son origine est diverse mais la majorité des cas est associée à un événement traumatique. Le traitement actuel de référence est la chirurgie endovasculaire mais qui est non faisable pour la majorité des chirurgiens en milieu tropical. Le but de cette étude était de décrire les aspects diagnostiques et thérapeutiques des FAA opérés dans notre institution et d’évaluer la place de la chirurgie conventionnelle dans leur prise en charge thérapeutique. Il s’agit d’une étude rétrospective et descriptive de 30 mois, réalisée dans notre établissement (CHU–JRA, Tananarive, Madagascar) entre 2012 et 2014. Au total, dix cas de FAA étaient opérés. Il existait 8 hommes avec un âge moyen de 30 ans. Les étiologies étaient d’ordre traumatique accidentel (n=6) ou iatrogène (n=4). La plupart des patients présentaient une tuméfaction douloureuse et pulsatile (n=8). L’existence d’une plaie cicatricielle en regard de la tuméfaction était constatée chez 5 patients. Les lésions intéressaient l’artère radiale (n=3), fémorale (n=2), brachiale (n=2), carotide (n=2) et ulnaire (n=1). Le diagnostic était confirmé à l’aide d’un échodoppler chez tous les patients.

Summary
A false aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm (PA) is the formation of a pulsatile and encapsulated hematoma in communication with the lumen of a perforated artery. Its origin is different but most cases are associated with a traumatic event. Currently, the referenced treatment is endovascular surgery but it is not feasible for the majority of vascular surgeons working in a tropical environment. The aim of this study was to describe the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of arterial PA (APA) encountered in our institution and to evaluate the place of open surgical technique in their management. This was a 30-month retrospective and descriptive study carried out in our institution (CHU-JRA, Antananarivo, Madagascar). Between 2012 and 2014, ten cases of APA were operated. There were 8 men with an average age of 30 years. The etiologies were accidental trauma (n=6) or iatrogenic vascular injury (n=4). Most patients had a painful and pulsatile swelling (n=8). The presence of a wound scar located on the swelling was observed in 5 patients. The false aneurysms were localized in the radial (n=3), femoral (n=2), brachial (n=2), carotid (n=2) and ulnar (n=1) arteries. The diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasound Doppler in all patients. The treatment was an open surgical procedure and consisted of lateral suture (n=4), resection with direct end-to-end anastomosis (n=1) or using autologous saphenous vein graft (n=2) or ligation (n=3). Postoperative courses and outcomes at last follow-up were uneventful with optimal patency rate."

abstract = "Six Medicago truncatula genotypes differing in cadmium susceptibility were used to test the effect of this heavy metal on mineral, carbohydrate and amino acid supply in growing radicles. Cadmium treatment caused alteration of macronutrient (Ca and K), microelement (Fe, Zn and Cu), carbohydrate (total soluble sugars (TSS), glucose, fructose and sucrose) and free amino acid (FAAS) accumulations. These mobilization changes differed in the tested genotypes. Carbohydrates were determining to susceptible lines’ growth in control condition; free amino acids enabled tolerant lines to counteract cadmium intrusion. Transcriptional changes in response to cadmium treatment were analyzed on MtMST, a gene encoding a monosaccharide transport protein. A significant down-regulation was observed in the most susceptible line TN1.11. Glucose was over-consumed in tolerant lines. Thus, glucose metabolism integrity seems essential to maintain growth under cadmium exposure. Analysis of germination medium showed solute losses at the expense of suitable mobilization to the growing embryonic axis and highlights cadmium-triggered membrane alterations. FAAS and TSS leakages were reduced in tolerant lines while monosaccharide losses were accentuated in susceptible lines. This research work gave an overview of cadmium deleterious effects on biomass mobilization and membrane integrity. Carbon metabolism is shown to be primordial to enhance early embryonic growth and nitrogen metabolism is revealed to be crucial to establish seedling growth under cadmium stress."

abstract = "Background
Oral Submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic inflammatory mucosal disease of unknown etiology. Statistics show cases of OSF which has a high rate of overall prevalence and increase the chance of malignant transformation. As we know malignant cells is situated in a very complex microenvironment with altered metabolic pathway including intermediates which participate in oxidative stress process which enhances metabolic rewiring and promotes tumor progression. This study aims to evaluate the tumor microenvironment and their role in metabolic reprogramming.
Methods
This study was conducted on the serum sample of OSF (n = 20) compared to the healthy group (n = 20) using ELISA. The serum levels of intermediate by-products of metabolic pathway and oxidative stress induced biomolecular damage products were determined. The sensitivity of results was analyzed by correlating it with markers of metabolic status (Glucose, Total cholesterol, Total protein).
Results
Metabolic pathway intermediates molecules like Fatty Acids (FAA), Ascorbic acid, Citrate, Oxaloacetate (OAA), levels were significantly high in the serum of OSF cases. This indicated that intermediates act as a metabolic switch that drives cells to adapt malignant transformation pathway. Markers related to oxidative DNA damage (8-hydroxy-2' -deoxyguanosine), Oxidative lipid peroxidation (8-epi-Prostaglandin F2α), and Protein carbonyl were significantly up-regulated. This significant increase in oxidative stress marker revealed the reprogramming of the metabolic pathway for fulfilling the nutritional requirement of cancer cells. A further significant correlation was observed with metabolic products confirmed altered metabolic status.
Conclusion
Our findings could identify the differentiating intermediate pathway metabolites and oxidative damage to biomolecules that are leading to rewiring of metabolism in the OSF group. Findings described in the study can be helpful to explain further the molecular aspects that lead to the progression of OSF towards carcinogenesis."

This method was used for the separation and preconcentration of some metal ions including Cd2+, Cr6+, Pb2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ prior to their determination using the micro-sampling flame atomic absorption spectrometry (MS-FAAS) technique. The most interesting aspect of this nanosorbent is its immediate dissolvability at pH values lower than 4. This capability drastically eliminates the elution step, leading to a great improvement in the extraction efficiency and a decrease in the extraction time. Also in this method, the use of a syringe nanofilter eliminates the need for the centrifugation step, which is time-consuming and essentially causes the analysis to be off-line. Several effective parameters governing the extraction efficiency including the sample solution pH, amount of nanosorbent, eluent condition, number of air-agitation cycles, and sonication time were investigated and optimized. Under the optimized conditions, the good linear dynamic ranges of 2–70, 6–360, 7–725, 7–370, and 8–450 ng mL−1 for the Cd2+, Cr6+, Pb2+, Co2+and Ni2+ ions, respectively, with the correlation of determinations (R2s) higher than 0.997 were obtained. The limits of detection (LODs) were found to be 0.6, 1.7, 2.0, 2.1, and 2.4 for the Cd2+, Cr6+, Pb2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ ions, respectively. The intra-day and inter-day precisions (percent relative standard deviations (%RSDs) (n = 5)) were below 7.8%. The proposed method was also successfully applied for the extraction and determination of the target ions in different biological fluid and tap water samples."

Thus, for a given source and aggregate, the type of crusher may play a critical role in producing aggregates having different shape parameters. The present study was undertaken to compare shape parameters of fine aggregates produced from three different crushers, i.e. vertical shaft impactor (VSI), cone crusher (CC) and horizontal shaft impactor (HSI). Basaltic fine aggregates collected from three different crushers was divided into five sizes, namely FA1 (P4.75-R2.36: aggregate passing 4.75mm and retaining on 2.36mm), FA2 (P2.36-R1.18), FA3 (P1.18-R0.600), FA4 (P0.600-R0.300) and FA5 (P0.300-R0.150). The angularity and form 2D values of different sizes and types of fine aggregates were measured using Aggregate Image Measurement System (AIMS) in accordance with AASHTO TP 81. Further, conventional technique namely fine aggregate angularity (FAA) test was used to measure angularity of fine aggregates. Furthermore, Angle of Repose (AoR) test was conducted to identify influence of shape characteristics on particle packing behaviour. The study showed that both the techniques (i.e., AIMS and FAA) could differentiate among the quality of fine aggregates produced from different crushers. However, both techniques resulted in opposite trend in angularity of aggregates. The AIMS measurement showed that angularity and form 2D was highest for aggregates produced from HSI crusher followed by CC and VSI. On the other hand, FAA showed that aggregates produced from CC crusher had maximum angularity followed by VSI and HSI. Conclusively, the AIMS showed that HSI crusher could produce aggregates with highest angularity, while FAA showed that this type of crusher might produce aggregates with least angularity. Curiously, the AoR values showed no significant difference for the fine aggregates produced from different crushers. The interrelation between angularity and form 2D is also discussed in the paper."

The supramolecular gel (IL-PMo12) exhibits an ordered structure, various physicochemical properties, and specifically as a result of its substantial reversible self-assembly, it can be used as an intelligent ion-exchange smart platform in the carbon paste bulk of the electrode. The provided materials were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, UV–vis, and elemental analyses. As expected, a significant linear correspondence was found between the sensor output signal (emf/mV) and logarithm of Al(III) ion activity with a Nernstian slope of 19.9 (±0.2) mV decade−1 over a wide concentration range of 1.0 × 10−9 to 2.2 × 10−1 mol L−1 (R2 = 0.9997). The sensor considered, exploits an astounding lower limit of detection and short response time of 7.94 × 10−10 mol L−1 and 8 s respectively within the working pH range of 2.0 to 5.0. A statistical design of experimental (Taguchi method with Qualitek-4 software and L16 orthogonal array robust design) was implemented in this work to optimize the process to achieve the least number of experimental runs as much as possible. Ultimately, practical capability of the sensor was investigated successfully by assessment of Al(III) ion quantity in some aqueous samples namely mineral water, Al-Mg syrup, black tea extract, and ore samples (Basalt and Andesite), in perfect agreement with flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS)."

The differentiation of a two-dimensional thallus begins 5 days after germination maturation of adult gametophytes occurs about 30 days after sowing. Adult gametophytes are heart-shaped, bisexual and glabrous. Antheridia are formed by three cells: basal, annular and opercular cell with a pore. Archegonia have a neck of 4-cells. The young sporophyte becomes visible within 8 weeks after spores are sown. The taxonomic significance of the gametophyte morphology is discussed."

We report our experience with the treatment of femoral artery aneurysms (FAAs) under local anaesthesia with limited dissection, using endografts to facilitate the proximal anastomosis and some distal anastomoses.
Method
Between January 2006 and December 2010, six males, mean age 72 years (range, 65–80 years) with FAAs were treated at the University Hospital of Zurich. All operations were performed under local anaesthesia with analgosedation, except for one performed under spinal anaesthesia. After limited dissection and puncture of the anterior wall of the FAA, a sheath and a self-expanding endograft were introduced over a guide wire and with fluoroscopy they were guided intraluminally into the proximal normal neck of the FAA and deployed. Proximal arterial control was achieved with a balloon catheter introduced through the endograft. Then the FAAs were opened and distal arterial control is obtained with balloon catheters. The distal end of the stent graft was then sutured to the normal-sized distal arteries or to stent grafts placed within them.
Results
Of the six FAAs, four were true and two were false anastomotic aneurysms. Mean FAA diameter was 5.0 cm (range, 3.0–6.5 cm). Four patients also had aneurysmal involvement of the external iliac artery, one patient also had deep femoral aneurysms, but deep femoral circulation was always preserved. In three of the patients, the distal anastomosis was created to the femoral artery bifurcation, in two patients to the deep femoral artery when the superficial femoral artery (SFA) was chronically occluded and in one patient to the SFA. Immediate technical success was achieved in all six patients, and graft patency was observed from 9 to 48 months (mean 29 months). There were no amputations, complications or deaths.
Conclusion
This technique for repair of FAAs can be performed under local anaesthesia, minimises dissection and complications and simplifies exclusion of these lesions. It is of particular value in high-risk patients with large FAAs."

Maximum coliform bacterial contaminants (4.0 × 102 cfu/g) were completely eliminated following an irradiation dose of 2.5 kGy, whereas a viable bacterial load of 9.0 × 103 cfu/g was completely eliminated at 5.0 kGy. Major elements were present at higher concentrations in black tea samples originating from Sylhet compared to those from Moulvibazar. Among the analyzed elements, only Na and Fe were present at higher concentrations in the fresh tea leaves from Sylhet, whereas K, Ca and Mg were observed at higher concentrations in the tea leaves from Moulvibazar. The amount of each mineral in the black tea is acceptable for daily intake and is safe for consumption.

The results of this study showed significantly higher amount of Cd (0.18±0.06mgL−1) and Zn (4.87±1.34mgL−1) in the blood of traffic police wardens as compared to control group and according to World Health Organization, these values are 18 and 3 times more to the permissible limit of Cd and Zn respectively in human blood. In addition, significantly higher numbers of DNA damaged cells (28±13%) were observed in traffic police wardens as compared to control group (3.6±2%). Comet tail length was found to be doubled (4.7±1.7μm) in traffic police wardens as compared to the control group (2±1.2μm). These results could be linked to the concentrations of Cd and Zn in blood of traffic police wardens. In conclusion, our results showed that accumulation of Cd and Zn was higher in traffic police wardens due to air pollution (Zn and Cd) and has more damaged DNA of traffic police wardens in Pakistan."

The method is based on highly-efficient separation and preconcentration of silver by the complex formation of Ag(I) with 2-mercaptobenzimidazole and extracted by DLLME procedure using carbon tetrachloride as extraction and acetone as disperser solvent. After establishment of a cloudy solution, the phase separation is achieved and Ag(I) is determined in the enriched phase by FAAS. The method yields a linear calibration curve in the concentration range of 1–100ngmL−1 of Ag(I), and the limit of detection is 0.41ngmL−1. The proposed method was successfully applied to determine the trace amounts of silver in water, radiology film processing wastewater and ore samples."

Total content of FAA in A. tonsa nauplii was around 17% of dry weight at first development stage, and declined to 6% for later stages. Relative to body-volume and biomass, the FAA content indicated possible volume-dependent changes. However, changes in FAA with osmolytic activity could not account for this decline in FAA content, but suggests that the decline reflected degradation of residual FAAs from the embryonic stage. Glutamic acid revealed the largest change in relative abundance during naupliar development and declined from 29.0% at first nauplius stage to 7.1% at later stages. The high FAA pool in early naupliar stages may be necessary for naupliar development due to an absence of feeding at first development stages. The high FAA content in early nauplii indicates that A. tonsa is a valuable source for nutritional energy for first-feeding fish larvae and should be further exploited for aquaculture purposes. Enhancements to FAA abundances in nauplii through manipulation of maternal diets could be of future interest, as copepod nauplii can contain a substantial pool of FAAs at first development stage."

This paper presents an evaluation and assessment of different system architectures as well as experimental results demonstrating the feasibility of the multiple functions in a laboratory set-up. First, the conventional system requirements and the results reported by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) are discussed. A system design evaluation based on simulating cruise and ground operation of aircraft is performed demonstrating the benefits of systems with pressurized hydrogen tank storage and cabin air use. The requirements for a fuel cell system regarding aircraft inerting function are calculated based on the FAA analysis. Experimental results based on laboratory systems confirm the feasibility of the implementation of various functions with a single fuel cell system. Test platforms for further investigation of the systems are shortly described."

The analysis was conducted by positioning a Boeing 777-300ER (B777-300ER)aircraft at different locations (interior, corner, and edge of slab) as baseline while varying other NIKE3D-FAA inputs, including rigid pavement geometric features, mechanical properties of paving and foundation materials, equivalent temperature gradient and thermal coefficient of Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) layers. Several sensitivity charts were developed by examining the sensitivity of critical pavement responses to each input variation. Sensitivity evaluations were performed using a normalized sensitivity index (NSI) as the quantitative metric. Using such sensitivity evaluation, the most significant NIKE3D-FAA input parameters for generating an effective synthetic database that will lower computational cost for future modeling developments were identified."

abstract = "Designing pavement foundation for rigid airfield pavements and understanding the contribution of pavement foundation elements to overall pavement performance and pavement failure have been challenges for the rigid airfield pavement design community. While many models have been developed to best simulate pavement foundation behavior for rigid airfield pavements, many of them have focused only on the failure of Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) layer and did not sufficiently consider the contribution of pavement foundation to the failure. The Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA’s) pavement design software, FAARFIELD, considers the maximum horizontal stress at the bottom edge of the concrete slab for bottom-up cracking failure of a PCC layer, but does not consider the critical responses for failure of subbase and subgrade layers in rigid pavement design. It is clear that incorporating critical pavement foundation responses into pavement design procedures is of great interest. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of developing rapid three-dimensional finite-element (3D-FE)-based pavement foundation response and moduli prediction models for design of both new and rehabilitated rigid airfield pavement structures. The three case studies investigated in the development of the models include: (1) rigid pavement foundation response prediction models for different wide body aircraft loading conditions, (2) rigid pavement foundation response prediction models for Heavy/Falling Weight Deflectometer (H/FWD) loading conditions, and (3) single rigid-pavement moduli prediction model. The development procedure and results based on rapid 3D-FE based prediction models are presented in this paper along with other significant findings and recommendations for employing the developed models in the structural design and evaluation of rigid airfield pavement systems. It was found that the developed models were able to successfully predict 3D-FE pavement solutions for all cases investigated in this study, could account for rigid pavement foundation related distresses, and could be potentially integrated into FAARFIELD as surrogate forward response prediction models in the future."

Bird strike can be catastrophic, especially when small general aviation airplanes are involved. Indeed, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), to prevent catastrophic failures with casualties, obliges airplanes to be able to complete the flight after an impact with a medium dimensions bird. Hence, it is clear that, when designing aerospace components, the potential effects of the bird strike events must be taken into account to guarantee the structural integrity and, as a consequence, the passengers and the pilot safety. In order to optimize the costs, the experimental activity for certification purpose should be suitably prepared and driven by an extensive campaign of numerical simulations. Therefore, the accuracy and the effectiveness of the numerical models able to simulate the bird strike event and its consequences on the structural integrity become of major concern when designing aerospace components. In this paper, the numerical methodologies, commonly adopted for the simulation of the bird strike event, are presented and assessed focusing on their capability to predict the induced damage and the composite components’ residual strength."

abstract = "A typical aircraft can experience over 2000 fatigue cycles (cabin pressurisations) and even greater flight hours in a single year. An unavoidable by-product of aircraft use is that crack, impact and corrosion flaws develop throughout the aircraft's skin and substructure elements. Economic barriers to the purchase of new aircraft have placed even greater demands on efficient and safe repair methods. The use of bonded composite doublers offers the airframe manufacturers and aircraft maintenance facilities a cost-effective method to safely extend the lives of their aircraft. Instead of riveting multiple steel or aluminium plates to facilitate an aircraft repair, it is now possible to bond a single Boron-Epoxy composite doubler to the damaged structure. The FAA's Airworthiness Assurance Center at Sandia National Labs (AANC), Boeing, and Federal Express completed a pilot programme to validate and introduce composite doubler repair technology to the U.S. commercial aircraft industry. This project focused on repair of DC-10 fuselage structure and its primary goal was to demonstrate routine use of this repair technology using niche applications that streamline the design-to-installation process. As composite doubler repairs gradually appear in the commercial aircraft arena, successful flight operation data is being accumulated. These commercial aircraft repairs are not only demonstrating the engineering and economic advantages of composite doubler technology, but they are also establishing the ability of commercial maintenance depots to safely adopt this repair technique. This report presents the array of engineering activities that were completed in order to make this technology available for widespread commercial aircraft use. Focused laboratory testing was conducted to compliment the field data and to address specific issues regarding damage tolerance and flaw growth in composite doubler repairs. Fatigue and strength tests were performed on a simulated wing repair using a substandard design and a flawed installation. In addition, the new sol–gel surface preparation technique was evaluated. Fatigue coupon tests produced sol–gel results that could be compared with a large performance database from conventional, riveted repairs. It was demonstrated that not only can composite doublers perform well in severe off-design conditions (low doubler stiffness and presence of defects in doubler installation) but that the sol–gel surface preparation technique is easier and quicker to carry out while still producing optimum bonding properties. Nondestructive inspection (NDI) methods were developed so that the potential for disbond and delamination growth could be monitored and crack growth mitigation could be quantified. The NDI methods were validated using full-scale test articles and the FedEx aircraft installations. It was demonstrated that specialised NDI techniques can detect flaws in composite doubler installations before they reach critical size. Probability of Detection studies were integrated into the FedEx training in order to quantify the ability of aircraft maintenance depots to properly monitor these repairs. In addition, Boeing Structural Repair and Nondestructive Testing Manuals were modified to include composite doubler repair and inspection procedures. This report presents the results from the FedEx Pilot Program that involved installation and surveillance of numerous repairs on operating aircraft. Results from critical NDI evaluations are reported in light of damage tolerance assessments for bonded composite doublers. This work has produced significant interest from airlines and aircraft manufacturers. The successful Pilot Program produced flight performance history to establish the durability of bonded composite patches as a permanent repair on commercial aircraft structures. This report discusses both the laboratory data and Pilot Program results from repair installations on operating aircraft to introduce composite doubler repairs into mainstream commercial aircraft use."

The regression model retained 3 variables that accounted for 49% of the variation in FAA, most of which was accounted for by the role-physical subscale score of the SF-36. The FAA was well correlated with actual medical category.
Conclusions
The FAA is a valid measure of physical health in relation to physical workload."

In this study, it was investigated whether the wines from different Portuguese PGI could be differentiated based on their elemental profile. For this purpose, 60 red and white wine samples, from 6 different PGI were analysed for a wide panel of elements (53) by FAAS and ICP-MS. Discriminant analysis was used to find the elements with discriminant power. Despite the limited set of samples, the results showed that the concentration of several elements (e.g. Ca, Mn, Co, Zn, Br, Sr, Cd, W and Tl) was significantly different among wines and could reliably discriminate the wines from the different PGI regions."

In a context of hub classification, determining the contribution of each airport to the national network in terms of the two dimensions of hubbing -i.e., traffic generation and connectivity- is a key aspect. In this regard, the choice of an appropriate connectivity indicator is still an unresolved issue. This paper adapts the well-known flow centrality indicator to an air transport context and develops a novel measure of airport connectivity. An application to the US domestic network is provided, using quarterly data on passenger demand to perform a detailed time-series analysis of airport connectivity patterns between 1993 and 2012. The flow centrality indicator is then used to define an alternative airport classification method within the context of the Federal Aviation Administration’s National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIASs). Results show that there is potential for improving the existing airport typology by explicitly separating connectivity and traffic generation as classification criteria."

This manuscript has a double aim: contribute to the analytical characterization of this traditional beverage in terms of mineral constituents and evaluate the influence of the species of wooden barrel in the mineral content. Analyses were performed by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Cu, Mn, Zn, Fe, Ca and Mg), flame atomic emission spectrophotometry (Na and K) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Al, Cd and Pb). Orujos aged in Quercus alba showed significant higher value for the majority of metals whereas those aged in Quercus petraea showed the lowest contents. K, Na and Ca were the more abundant minerals in the analyzed distillates. The PCA analysis clearly showed a good separation of samples in terms of mineral constituents. The very low concentrations of all minerals evaluated indicated the good manufactured process and the consumer safety of aged Orujos."

In air transport, ‘occurrences’ are routinely reported by pilots and air traffic controllers, and in-flight data analysis systems automatically monitor aircraft system behaviour and capture parameter threshold exceedances. The safety analyst of a large airline has to analyse dozens of occurrences each day. To understand why events happened the analyst has to go beyond the given information and make causal inferences. The analyst is able to do this for causal factors closely related in time and space to the event itself by applying individual knowledge and expertise. But typically the result of the analysis is ad hoc reaction to each individual event. Systematic analysis is needed to find areas of improvement for factors that are further removed from the event (latent factors). New tools are needed to help the analyst in this respect. There is a need for models that represent possible causal event sequence scenarios that include technical, human, and organisational factors. Building such models is a huge task, and requires the combination of detailed knowledge of all aspects of the system, processing huge amounts of data, a substantial mathematical background and the ability to capture this all in a user friendly software tool to be used by the safety analysts. Experience in Causal Modelling of Air Transportation System (CATS) in the Netherlands and similar projects in FAA and Eurocontrol in aviation shows that this is indeed a formidable task, but it has to be done to further improve safety."

TIA rates were determined by measuring net uptake of a 14C-radiolabeled FAA tracer solution into the body after administration of a single bolus to the digestive tract by tube-feeding. Tracer solutions (concentration range: 0.02 to 100mM) were administered at <50% of gut volume (GV) and the response of TIA rate to increasing administered dose (pmol FAA ind−1) determined. GV was determined as the maximum volume of a tube-fed liquid bolus that could be retained in the digestive tract of a fasted larva without causing any evacuation from the mouth or anus, and was dependent on larval standard length. Our data revealed that alanine, proline and glutamic acid have different TIA rates (pmolmin−1), and results were consistent at both larval stages. At the same administered dose (pmol ind−1), the TIA rate for glutamic acid was only 8–25% of that of alanine and 15–30% of proline in both larval stages. In Early and Late larvae, the dose-dependent increase in proline and glutamic acid uptake was significantly more rapid than for alanine. Hence, alanine was the most rapidly absorbed FAA at low dose, followed by proline and then glutamic acid, but proline became more rapidly absorbed than alanine at the highest doses, in both stages. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that FAA representing neutral, imino and acidic classes, have different rates of absorption. Across a broad range of concentrations, Atlantic herring larvae have a much lower capacity to deliver glutamic acid from the intestinal lumen to body tissues relative to alanine and proline.
Statement of relevance
This paper provides important and quantitative information to understand uptake of different classes of dietary free amino acids in larval stages of fish. We use herring as model since it gives the best combination of size, transparency, robustness, gut morphology for in vivo tube feeding. The data is relevant for formulation of starter diets."

Temporal changes in selected concentrations of trace metals in vegetative and generative parts of Xanthoria parietina thalli exposed to urban-related pollution were analysed and the relationship between anatomical organisation and element accumulation identified. The lichen material included thalli relocated to an urban area of Cracow (southern Poland) along with their host trees, which had previously been cultivated at a site characterised by a lower level of air pollution. The thalli were sampled immediately and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after planting trees. Concentrations of Zn, Pb, Cd, Cu, Ni, and Cr, as measured by means of flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS), and various anatomical characteristics were determined in vegetative thalli and the corresponding apothecia. Accumulation of Pb over time demonstrated a pronounced upward trend; calculated exposed-to-control (EC) ratios indicate ‘severe accumulation’ of this element. Diverse levels of accumulation in different parts of thalli – higher, in the cases of Pb, Cd, Cu, Ni, Cr, and lower, in the case of Zn, in vegetative parts compared to apothecia – were observed. Thus sampling uniformity is highly desirable in air biomonitoring studies, along with a determination of which part of the thallus is to be designated for elemental analysis. The results also showed that certain anatomical characteristics are correlated with concentrations of metal elements in the thallus."

abstract = "Further improvement of growth performance in fish larviculture is closely linked to better understanding of the dietary amino acid (AA) requirements, and therefore of the processes involved in AA metabolism. In recent years, major advances in the understanding of fish larvae amino acid metabolism have been accomplished, in particular through the use of tracer studies. Modelling is a holistic approach to integrate knowledge on growth and metabolism and identify gaps in current understanding. A dynamic mechanistic model that simulates AA metabolism of fish larvae was developed. It aims to improve the understanding of larval digestion and absorption of dietary AA, and the postprandial AA metabolism and growth. The model also assists in the interpretation of results obtained from tracer studies. The model is driven by amino acid intake, with the absorbed dietary AA being used for energy production or for biosynthetic processes. The model is implemented for Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) larvae fed Artemia, and was parameterized using literature data. The model allows to integrate the results obtained after feeding a single meal with tracer AA, and following these tracer AA in the free AA and protein pools of larval gut and larval body at different time points after the meal. Model simulations suggest that there is a sharp dynamic change in the FAA pool after a meal while the protein pool is little affected. This suggests that the AA composition of the food has a major contribution to the FAA pool composition. This implies that sole larvae is highly sensitive to dietary AA imbalances, having high AA unavoidable losses unless the dietary AA profile is well balanced. The model also suggests that rates of protein synthesis and AA catabolism rapidly increases after the meal, with the peak for this postprandial metabolism occurring only 1h after the meal, and the rates returning to “basal” values 2h after the meal. This suggests a rapid processing of the Artemia protein by the larvae, and supports the need for feeding sole larvae at a high frequency in order to fully use its growth potential. Mechanistic modelling is useful and an important complement in evaluation of metabolism kinetics in nutrient flux studies. Moreover, due to its mechanistic nature, the present model can be used with different AA tracers, and also for other fish species."

A remarkable accumulation of free amino acids (FAA) was detected in both batches along the ripening process, with batch T having higher mean levels than batch M (1795.2mg100g−1 DM vs. 1742mg100g−1 DM in S7, respectively), but with differences being significant for long ripened products. In both batches, glutamic acid became the most concentrated FAA in end products currently consumed (101.6mg100g−1 DM and 111.0mg100g−1 DM – S6; 233.8mg100g−1 DM and 220.9mg100g−1 DM – S7 from batches T and M, respectively) followed by leucine>alanine>taurine>serine>valine and taurine>alanine>leucine>serine>valine sequences in the former product from batches T and M, respectively, and, coincidently, the same sequence for both batches in the later (serine>leucine>alanine>proline>valine). Such effect on FAA concentrations led to a distinct (P<0.05) expression of sweet, bitter, acidic and aged sensorial attributes between batches, in S8 and S9 products. BA typical quantitative sequences varied between batches according to the ripening stage, with differences in S6 and S7 end products also reflecting the distinct microbial development rates and profiles observed.

Until now, quantitative determinations in FAAS were carried out by measuring the height of the peaks rather than their area. In our hands, the software was reconfigured and the area under the peaks could be measured. Considering area instead of height, the enhancement factor increases from 6.7 to 360 (approx. 54 times) giving a detection limit of 0.034μg·L−1, lower than that obtained using much more expensive instruments such as electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS) or inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (IPC-AES), greatly enhancing the potential of this methodology for future use in speciation studies. The operation conditions were: pH3, sample loading 50mL·min−1, elution flow rate 7.5mL·min−1. The anion exchanger lifetime was over 100adsorption/desorption cycles.

Soils were amended with six 15N-labeled amino-acid substrates that ranged widely in chemical properties, including molecular weight, C:N ratio, average net charge, hydrophobicity, and polarity: Arginine (Arg), Glutamine (Gln), Glutamate (Glu), Serine (Ser), Glycine (Gly) and Leucine (Leu). Mineralization of amino-acid N accounted for 7–45% (18% avg.) of the added label and was most strongly affected by soil characteristics, with mineralization increasing with increasing soil fertility. Mineralization of amino-acid N was unrelated to amino-acid C:N ratio, rather, I observed greater N mineralization from polar FAAs compared to non-polar ones. Assimilation of amino-acid N into microbial biomass accounted for 6–48% (29% avg.) of the added label, and was poorly predicted by either intrinsic amino-acid properties or soil properties, but instead appeared to be explicable in terms of compound-specific demand by soil micoorganisms. Sorption of amino-acid N to soil solids accounted for 4–15% (7% avg.) of the added label and was largely controlled by charge characteristics of individual amino acids. The fact that both positively- and negatively-charged amino acids were more strongly sorbed than neutral ones suggests that cation and anion exchange sites are an important factor controlling sorption of FAAs in these acid forest soils. Together, the findings from this study suggest that there may be important differences in the behavior of free amino acids in sandy, acidic forest soils compared to generalizations drawn from finer-textured grassland soils, which, in turn, might affect the availability of some FAAs in soil solution."

abstract = "The serotonergic and circadian systems are intertwined as serotonin modulates the response of the central brain suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) clock to light. Time-restricted feeding (RF) is characterized by increased food anticipatory activity (FAA) and controlled by the food-entrainable oscillator (FEO) rather than the SCN. Our objective was to test whether serotonin affects the FEO. Mice were treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluvoxamine (FLX) or the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA) and locomotor activity under ad libitum feeding, RF and different lighting conditions was monitored. Under AL, FLX administration did not affect 24-h locomotor activity, while mice treated with PCPA exhibited increased activity. RF-FLX-treated mice showed less FAA 2h before food availability (ZT2–ZT4) compared to RF- or RF-PCPA-fed mice. Under DD, RF-PCPA-treated mice displayed increased activity, as was seen under LD conditions. Surprisingly, RF-PCPA-treated mice showed free running in the FAA component. These results emphasize the role of serotonin in SCN-mediated activity inhibition and FEO entrainment and activity."

The highest photosynthetic apparatus (PA) activity in A. santonica leaves on CO2 gas exchange as well as the highest content of green pigments was observed in the morning. Maximum share of violaxanthin cycle key pigments – zeaxanthin (Zx) and antheraxanthin (Ax) was observed in the afternoon and decreased in the evening. Lipids/chlorophyll (Chl) ratio increased in the evening due to the decrease in Chl concentration, and content of linolenic acid (С18:3n3) was decreased in the middle of the day. The content of TBA-reacting products increased 1.4-fold in the middle of the day, and decreased approximately 2-fold in the evening. The decrease of the activity was observed in diurnal dynamics of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO). Increased accumulation of phenols and flavonoids, as well as free amino acids (FAA) in A. santonica leaves was observed in the middle of the day. Thus, the ability of A. santonica plants to resist the soil salinization, high levels of solar illumination and temperature consists of a number of protectively-adaptive reactions of metabolic and photosynthetic control."

Based on a common planting pattern of unilaterally fertilized double rows, the phenotype, free amino acid (FAA) contents, N contents of the soil and plants, root growth and gene expression of contrasting tea genotypes (Longjing43 (LJ43) and Liyou002 (LY002)) were compared in this study. Our results showed that, the unilaterally fertilized double row cultivation system led to N spatial heterogeneity in soil. For field growth, the ratio of young to mature leaves, leaf SPAD value, and differences between the two lines (near (-near) and far from (-far) the fertilization side) were smaller for the LJ43 strain than those for LY002. The ratio of secondary to primary roots was much higher in LJ-far than that in LY-far. The N contents of leaves, primary roots and secondary roots were higher in LJ-far than those in LY-far. The leaf distribution of total N and most FAAs were higher in LJ-far than those in LY-far. On lines far from the fertilization sides, γ-aminobutyric acid and alanine tended to accumulate more in LY002 than in LJ43, while glutamic acid and theanine tended to accumulate more in LJ43 than in LY002. Indeed, there were some genes (CsGABA-T, CsGAD1, CsGAD2, CsAlaAT and CsGs(TS)1) involved in the conversion of these amino acids. Moreover, the expression of some genes involved in N transport and assimilation (such as CsNRT2.5 and CsGS2) were up regulated in LJ-far, which may also help improve the low N tolerance in LJ43. In summary, the greater adaptive ability of LJ43 might be related to: (1) preferential development of secondary roots; (2) better N transporting ability; (3) key gene regulation to FAA transformation. Our findings may contribute to the advancement of tea planting patterns and a more complete understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms of tea responses to the spatial heterogeneity of N."

MAA, FAA, AA, and AAA (up to 100 µM) alone were not toxic for HL60 cells or granulocytes. In the presence of the myeloperoxidase substrate H2O2, MAA reduced cytotoxicity for HL60 cells at low concentrations (<50 µM), but increased cytotoxicity at 100 µM H2O2. Neutrophil granulocytes were resistant to H2O2 and MAA. Fe2+ and Fe3+ were not toxic to HL60 cells, irrespective of the presence of H2O2 and MAA. Similarly, MAA did not increase the toxicity of lactoferrin, hemoglobin or methemoglobin for HL60 cells. Hemin (hemoglobin degradation product containing a porphyrin ring and Fe3+) was toxic on HL60 cells and cytotoxicity was increased by MAA. EDTA, N-acetylcystein and glutathione prevented the toxicity of hemin and hemin/MAA. The absorption spectrum of hemin changed concentration-dependently after addition of MAA, suggesting an interaction between Fe3+ and MAA. NMR revealed the formation of a stable MAA reaction product with a reaction pathway involving the formation of an electrophilic intermediate. In conclusion, MAA, the principle metabolite of metamizole, increased cytotoxicity of hemin by a reaction involving the formation of an electrophilic metabolite. Accordingly, cytotoxicity of MAA/hemin could be prevented by the iron chelator EDTA and by the electron donors NAC and glutathione. Situations with increased production of hemin may represent a risk factor for metamizole-associated granulocytopenia."

The presence of the sulphonic group was studied with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).

Sulphonated HIPS reduced Zn2+ from 80 to 38.3mg/L compared to 10–1.6mg/L for sulphonated EPS. Similarly, sulphonated HIPS reduced Pb2+ from 100 to 33mg/L compared to 80–50.3mg/L for sulphonated EPS. The adsorption data followed both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms and pseudo-second order kinetics. Maximum adsorption capacities as quantified by the Langmuir parameter qmax for HIPS was 5.01mg/g, EPS 0.38mg/g for Zn2+ and HIPS 6.80mg/g, EPS 0.68 mg/g for Pb2+. The data were analysed using pseudo first order and pseudo second order Lagergren equation and the adsorption kinetics of the metals Pb2+ and Zn2+ was found to follow the pseudo second order kinetic model. Interpretation of the sorption data in terms of separation factor (SF) suggested that the removal of Pb2+ and Zn2+ from water mainly occurred through chemisorption."

The method is based on Pd(II) colorimetric reaction with immobilized 3-[2′-thiazolylazo]-2,6 diaminopyridine (2,6 TADAP) retained in a cationic resin Dowex 50W X4 20/50. The immobilization of Pd(II) on solid phase is combined with PAS. The Pd(II) concentration was determinated by conventional photoacoustic measurement in the range of 625–645nm. The calibration for Pd(II) was linear over the range 12–210μgL−1. The obtained analytical features were LOD 4μgL−1 and LOQ 12μgL−1. The relative standard deviation of the method was <5%. The proposed method has been successfully tested in determination of leachable Pd in disposed catalyst and in spiked samples of tap water. In the introduced method, complicated preparatory steps became simple, inexpensive, and it is suitable for applications in environmental samples. Results obtained by PAS agree with those obtained by using conventional FAAS. The figures of merit in this method make it an attractive alternative to UV–vis and FAAS."

The morphological and chemical changes in activated carbon were fully characterized by SEM, TGA, DSC, FTIR techniques.

The aim of this study was to determine the concentration of Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, Zn (environmental pollutants i.e. toxic elements), and Co, K, Mg, Mn, Na (common elements) in phosphate rocks used for production of fertilizer in Pakistan. Rock samples of local origin were collected from the geological rock formations around the city of Abbottabad and those of foreign origin were obtained from the fertilizer factories and research institutes in Pakistan. Analysis of phosphate rock for all the elements of interest was carried out with Flame Atomic Absorption spectrometer (FAAS) except for sodium which was analyzed using Flame Photometer, while the concentration of potassium was determined using both the techniques. The results showed that heavy metal content was lower in Pakistani phosphate than that in imported rock and were below the safe limits with the exception of lead whose concentration was found to be higher in local phosphate deposits than that in imported rock samples. Phosphate rock is a source of heavy metal pollution of air, soil, water, food chain etc, therefore requires removal of heavy metals (HMs) from the rock prior to its use."

It was found that the 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium salicylate was selective to extract Cr(III). The Cr(VI) content was calculated by subtracting Cr(III) from the total chromium with conversion of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in the presence of ascorbic acid. Based on the preliminary experiments, the factors influencing phase behavior of the IL/aqueous biphasic system were investigated. The main factors affected the extraction of Cr(III) were modeled by using central composite design and optimized by using non-linear Nelder-Mead method. Under the defined optimum conditions, the calibration curves were linear over the concentration range of 40–470μgL−1 and 55–500μgL−1 for Cr(III) and total Cr, respectively. The limit of detection (3Sb/m) for Cr(III) was 7.7μgL−1. The relative standard deviations for six replicate determinations of 250μgL−1 of Cr(III) and total Cr were 5.5% and 7.6%, respectively.

To gain insight, a Cd-human serum albumin (HSA) 1:1 (molar ratio) complex was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled on-line to a flame atomic absorption spectrometer (FAAS). Using a phosphate buffered saline (PBS)-buffer mobile phase, the stability of the Cd-HSA complex was investigated in the presence of 2.0mM of SMW ligands, including taurine, acetaminophen, l-methionine, l-cysteine (Cys), d,l-homocysteine (hCys) or l-cysteine methyl-ester (Cys-Me). While taurine, acetaminophen and l-methionine did not affect its integrity, Cys, hCys and Cys-Me completely abstracted Cd from HSA. Subsequent investigations into the effect of 1.5, 1.0 and 0.5mM Cys and hCys on the integrity of the Cd-HSA complex revealed clear differences with regard to the nature of the eluting SMW-Cd species between these structurally related endogenous thiols. Interestingly, the Cd-specific chromatograms that were obtained for 0.5mM hCys revealed the elution of an apparent mixture of the parent Cd-HSA complex with a significant contribution of a structurally uncharacterized CdxhCysy species. Since this hCys concentration is encountered in blood plasma of hyperhomocysteinemia patients and since previous studies by others have revealed that a SH-containing carrier mediates the uptake of Cd into hepatocytes, our results suggest that plasma hCys may play a role in the toxicologically relevant translocation of Cd from the bloodstream to mammalian target organs."

The maximum sorption capacity for Co(II) was found to be 0.203mmolg−1 at pH 9.0. Sorbed Co(II) was completely eluted by 3.5mL of 3molL−1 HCl and measured using flame atomic absorption spectrometer (FAAS). The structure of the extracted Co(II) complex was confirmed by single crystal X-ray structure and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) of the chelated Co(II) complex revealed its stability at the optimum extraction temperature (55°C). The method was reproducible with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 0.6% (N=10) with three sigma detection limit (N=10) of 0.6μgg−1. A pre-concentration factor, 94 was achieved. Interferences from Mn2+ and Cu2+ ions were eliminated by prior oxidation of Mn2+ by KIO4 to MnO4− and masking of Cu2+ with NH4SCN, respectively. A plausible mechanism for the selective extraction of Co(II) was attributed to the formation of a first order water insoluble inner–metallic complex as confirmed by the single crystal X-ray structure analysis. The developed method has been tested for trace level separation and estimation of cobalt in some certified reference materials. Analyses of some biological and environmental samples were performed."

However, the relationship between the egg FAAs content and the production of viable embryos and larvae (at different developmental stages) in batch spawner pelagophils has not yet comprehensively been investigated. Viable eggs of common dentex, Dentex dentex, were obtained from captive broodstocks. Egg wet weight (WW), dry weight (DW), and water content (%W) and viability parameters, or VPs (egg floating rate [FR], hatching rate [HR], and larval survival rate [SR] at days 0 to 5 posthatch) were determined for 45 egg batches. The egg batches were classified according to their HR magnitude. Twelve egg batches with the same WW, DW, and %W were taken from the same broodstock and at the same developmental stage to determine the qualitative and quantitative composition of FAAs. The total FAA (TFAA) content, glutamic acid (Glu), asparagine (Asn), glutamine (Gln), and arginine (Arg) were correlated with VPs. The Glu was significantly correlated with HR and SR at 0 day posthatch (dph), the Asn with SR at 1 dph, and the Gln and Arg with FR and HR. Of the 361 ratios made based on the absolute concentrations of FAAs, 24 ratios were correlated with VPs (P<0.005) through 42 simple regression models (R2=0.641 to 0.846). Of the 42 significant relationships found ∼10%, ∼28%, ∼12%, ∼30%, ∼8%, ∼4%, ∼2%, ∼2%, and ∼2% of the models show the relations of the egg FAAs ratios with FR, HR, SR at days 1 to 5 posthatch, and %W, respectively. A path coefficient in combination with a Pearson's correlation coefficient provided a series of statistical evidences to show the effects of the egg FAAs interrelations on the relationships found between quantitative composition of a FAA and a VP."

The interactions of this membrane with water, hydroxyl ions and methanol were studied with both calorimetry and NMR and compared with the widely used proton exchange membrane Nafion® 115. The results indicate that FAA-2 has a tighter structure and more homogeneous distribution of ionic groups in contrast to the clustered structure of Nafion, moreover, the diffusion of OH− ions through this membrane is clearly slower compared to water molecules. The permeability of methanol through the FAA-2 membrane was found to be an order of magnitude lower than for Nafion. Fuel cell experiments in 1moldm−3 methanol with FAA-2 resulted in OCV of 0.58V and maximum power density of 0.32mWcm−2. However, even higher current densities were obtained with highly concentrated fuels. This implies that less water is needed for fuel dilution, thereby decreasing the mass of the fuel cell system. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for the ADMFC was used to determine ohmic resistance of the cell facilitating the further membrane development."

Literature compositional data of the Ecuadorian obsidian outcrops provide some constraints on the provenance of the analyzed waste flakes, even though different methods of analyses make comparisons a difficult task. Concerning the obsidian artifacts of La Florida and Milan, they come from the well known Sierra de Guamanì obsidian sources (Cordillera Real). By contrast, the obsidian fragments of the Sumaco settlement show some compositional characters compatible with obsidian erratic pebbles recently discovered in some river banks of the Amazonian foothills draining the easternmost flanks of the Antisana volcano in the Cordillera Real as well. In this way, the obsidian artifacts found at the Sumaco site reinforce the opinion that Ecuadorian source inventory is not yet exhaustive. Although the Antisana volcano seems to be the best candidate to find out additional primary outcrops of obsidian sources, it cannot be also excluded that sub-Andean and Amazonian people directly took advantage from obsidian secondary sources (e.g. river banks), rather than procurements from primary outcrops in the Cordillera Real. The new archaeological findings at the Sumaco volcano are really of paramount importance in tracing the ancient routes of a possible obsidian eastward trade toward the Amazonian region."

abstract = "Italy, as well as many other countries, has increasing interest in Commercial Space Transportation and in particular, in suborbital flights. A suborbital space transportation system is an opportunity to involve the Italian industry in the development of new technologies, exploit opportunities of microgravity experimentation and pilots/astronauts training, as well as catalyse the national industry. The central position of Italy in the Mediterranean basin, the generically favourable climate condition, the touristic vocation resulting in hospitality at the highest level, pretty much allow year round suborbital operations and unique customer experience. Consequently, Italy appears to be a suitable location to host a Spaceport, even though the density of population has to be factored in as a key aspect, together with a proper environmental assessment. This paper outlines the current Italian approach that, instead of focusing on the development of new Spaceport from scratch, evaluates the capabilities of existing airports and their possible upgrades to achieve the Spaceport license, when a proper regulatory frame is established. Advances in the technical activities that are being conducted to assess various Italian sites of interest are described, including trade off methodologies and ranking criteria. Different aspects are considered, from the availability of civil and military airports, to the identification of the best location between coastline or inland sites but, first of all, in compliance to the safety requirements. Some specific Spaceport infrastructure and operational aspects are described, along with their integration with the already existing ones. These include hangars, propellant storage facilities, ground support equipment, high and low airspace surrounding the airport area, ascent and descent corridors, as well as tracking telemetry station to support specific mission profiles in integrated fashion with the existing airport infrastructure and air traffic. The paper will also describe the approach to the definition of a harmonized cooperative regulatory framework, according to the Aviation Authority, that represents the basis to assess suborbital operations and allows the relevant missions execution. In this activity, basing upon an established Memorandum of Cooperation between FAA, ENAC and the Italian Space Agency, the existing FAA/AST regulatory work frame is considered as reference benchmark and further tailored to the Italian case. Some considerations will also be developed relevant to initial challenges to be faced, by interested stakeholders, in starting commercial spaceflight initiatives as a new ground and emerging business opportunity."

abstract = "The present work describes the development of a µSI-LOV method for the simultaneous screening of cadmium and lead in potentially contaminated water samples. To attain the biparametric determination, dithizone was chosen as the spectrophotometric reagent as it forms a colored complex with both metal ions, at different pH conditions. The cadmium determination was attained in strong alkaline conditions (pH≈12); the lead determination was calculated by the difference with the determination of both metals in mild alkaline conditions (pH≈8). The colored complex was measured at 550nm and the method presented a LOD of 34μgL−1 for cadmium and 56μgL−1 for lead, with a sample consumption of 20µL per assay and a determination rate of 55h−1. The results obtained were in agreement with those obtained by FAAS. The developed method was efficiently applied to the screening of cadmium and lead in marine port waters."

The present procedure is based on a combination of carrier element-free coprecipitation (CEFC) and flame atomic absorption spectrometric (FAAS) determinations of understudy trace metal ions. A cationic surfactant (N-cetyl N,N,N trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)) as coprecipitant was used without adding any carrier element for coprecipitation of understudy ions. The optimum conditions for the coprecipitation process were investigated on several commonly tested experimental parameters, such as pH of the solution, amount of coprecipitant. The pre-concentration factor was found to be 10. The detection limits corresponding to three times the standard deviation of the blank (N=20) for Cd(II), Cr(III), Co(II), Cu(II), Fe(III), Pb(II) and Mn(II) ions were found as 0.61, 16.8, 12.7, 1.36, 2.08, 4.30 and 0.22μgL−1, respectively. The present procedure was successfully applied for separation and pre-concentration of investigated ions in several liquid environmental samples. In order to support the accuracy of the method, the certified reference materials (BCR 141 R calcareous loam soil and CRM025-050 soil) were analyzed. The experimental results are in good agreement with the certified values."

The diffusion coefficients and activation energies of CO2 in the composites ranged between 6.33×10−12±7×10−12cm2/s and 0.377±0.184kJ/mol respectively at atmospheric pressure and 306K. The prepared composites are thermally stable. A comparison of material cost and adsorption capacity showed that they are cheap and efficient for CO2 capturing."

Leaves were inoculated in a callus induction medium, composed of Y3 salts, 2.5 g L−1 activated charcoal and 450 μM Picloram. For multiplication of the calli, they were separated from the explants and inoculated in a medium with the same composition as the previous phase. Histological analyses were performed on samples of immature leaves with and without calli at 0, 3, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 days in an induction medium, and on samples of the different types of calli and somatic embryos obtained during multiplication and differentiation. For this, the samples were fixed in FAA, dehydrated in an alcohol series and infiltrated in resin. Anatomical sections obtained on a microtome were stained with Toluidine Blue for structural characterization. At 60 days, analyses revealed the formation of callogenic masses in the vicinity of smaller vascular bundles. This multiplication approach allowed for the proliferation of the primary cell mass that evolved into new lineages of calli, especially the embryogenic yellowish nodular lineage, which originated somatic embryos. Additional histochemical analyses showed starch accumulation only in the adjacencies of areas undergoing intense cell division. The morpho-anatomic characterization allows the rapid identification of potential calli for the formation of somatic embryos from leaf tissues in macaw palm and promotes future investigations of the participation of vascular tissues in the events that precede somatic embryogenesis."

This project provides a two-phase approach to assessing the human performance impacts associated with executing NextGen RNAV/RNP operations. Phase one developed an RNAV/RNP execution factor profile describing the factors known to impact the successful execution of RNAV/RNP procedures. Phase two assessed the potential positive and negative impact on the execution factor profile based on a series of proposed NextGen changes. Seventeen NextGen changes planned for implementation between 2014 and 2020 were analyzed including interval management concepts, RNP established approaches, and reduced separation requirements for approaches and departures. Human-System Interaction Models (HSIMs) were developed for each NextGen concept to outline the impacted tasks and interactions associated with implementing each change. A panel of subject matter experts then compared the HSIMs for each NextGen change against the RNAV/RNP execution factor profile. The resulting assessment found consistent impacts of NextGen changes to performance monitoring associated with executing RNAV/RNP procedures and aircraft eligibility assessments associated with assigning RNAV/RNP procedures. A summary of overarching impacts of these changes on RNAV/RNP procedure execution in the NextGen environment are described."

The higher levels of free amino acids (FAAs) found in samples suggest that cheeses underwent a strong proteolytic process. Differences in quantity and variety of FAAs were influenced by the two ripening environments. Diacylglycerols and butyric acid, which can be linked to lipolysis, were detected in all the samples. Longer ripened samples had higher contents of rumenic acid (18:2 cis-9, trans-11) and glycerol, and lower contents of lactate and citrate.

Typically, the vertical depth of the shelf is greater than the distance a sub-population can vertically migrate during a diel cycle, limiting the ability of a sub-population to photosynthetically fix carbon toward the surface and access nutrients sub-surface. This project investigated changes of Karenia brevis (C.C. Davis) G. Hansen et Moestrup intracellular carbon, nitrogen, internal nitrate (iNO3), free amino acid (FAA), and total lipid concentrations in high-light, nitrate-replete (960μmolquantam−2s−1, 80μM NO3), and high-light, nitrate-reduced (960μmolquantam−2s−1, <5μM NO3) mesocosms. The nitrate-reduced mesocosm had a slowed cell division rate when compared to the nitrate-replete mesocosm. Minimum intracellular carbon, nitrogen, iNO3, FAA, and total lipid concentrations during the largest surface sub-population aggregations led to the conclusion that daughter cells resulting from cell division received unequal shares of the parental resources and that this inequality influenced migration behavior. Nutrient reduced daughter cells were more strongly influenced by light and phototaxis for carbon production than their replete same cell division sister cells during vertical migration thus rapidly increasing the fulfillment of constituents through photosynthesis. Vertical migration was consistent with an optimization scheme based on threshold limits through utilization or formation of photosynthate. We propose a simplified conceptual model describing how K. brevis is transported along the benthos of the west Florida shelf from off-shore to on-shore. Dynamic carbon thresholds are also suggested for future DVM modeling efforts on K. brevis populations transported between nitrogen replete and nitrogen reduced environmental conditions."

In interpreting these provisions of UNCLOS, the ITLOS made reference to specific clauses in fisheries access agreements (FAAs) concluded by coastal States and flag States. This article examines in more detail the contribution of FAAs to the concept of flag State responsibility. It will first offer a brief discussion of the framework for fisheries access under national jurisdiction provided by UNCLOS and will then take a closer look at how certain provisions contained in FAAs have contributed –and could contribute in the future– to the concept of flag State responsibility in international fisheries law. The article concludes that FAAs have contributed significantly to the development of the concept of flag State responsibility for fishing activities in the past and may do so to a more limited extent in the future."

This stability has not been demonstrated among adolescents, and the correspondence between resting FAA and personality has been inconsistently observed. The present study examined stability of FAA and the association between resting FAA and behavioral activation among adolescents. At baseline and 4 months, 99 adolescents completed a resting electroencephalogram (EEG) and a pencil-and-paper measure of personality (BIS/BAS). FAA showed good stability over time (Intra-class correlation coefficient=0.65, p<0.001), but there was no correlation between FAA and personality.

Both polynomial families appear as Lie coefficients in expansions of certain derivatives of higher order. Substituting Dj(φ) (the jth derivative of a fixed function φ) in place of the indeterminates Xj shows that both Sn,k and Bn,k are differential polynomials depending on φ and on its inverse φ¯, respectively. Some new light is shed thereby on Comtet’s solution of the Lagrange inversion problem in terms of the Bell polynomials. According to Haiman and Schmitt that solution is essentially the antipode on the Faà di Bruno Hopf algebra. It can be represented by X1−(2n−1)Sn,1. Moreover, a general expansion formula that holds for the whole family Sn,k (1≤k≤n) is established together with a closed expression for the coefficients of Sn,k. Several important properties of the Stirling numbers are demonstrated to be special cases of relations between the corresponding polynomials. As a non-trivial example, a Schlömilch-type formula is derived expressing Sn,k in terms of the Bell polynomials Bn,k, and vice versa."

We provide mechanisms that, unlike the FAA's current mechanism, satisfy our incentive properties to the greatest extent possible given the FAA's own design constraints. Our mechanisms supplement Deferred Acceptance with a “self-optimization” step accounting for each airline's granted right to control its assigned portion of the landing schedule."

This work demonstrated that the saline solution pH lowers to approximately 7-8 in the first hour of reaction (initial pH of approximately 10), remaining constant until the end of the reaction. Through the analysis by AAS, it was found that the concentration of Ca ions in the brine decreases with time. A greatest reduction in the Ca ions concentration occurs within the first two hours of reaction, remaining constant in the others hours. The Mg concentration showed the trend of the final concentration remains close to initial concentration, even with the carbonates precipitation. SEM analysis indicated that the precipitates obtained had morphology similar to that found for various forms of calcium carbonate (i.e calcite and aragonite).

A continuous flow tubular reactor was built to perform the catalytic reaction tests, and the following reaction variables were analyzed: reaction temperature (600–700°C range), space velocity (WHSV of 15 and 45Lh−1gcat−1) and reaction time (up to 10h). Increasing the reaction temperature in the dry reforming reactions led to higher H2 yields and higher conversions of CH4 and CO2. In general, better conversion rates were achieved in the reactions performed with the 15% Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. In the reactions in which the space velocity was varied, it was observed that increasing the space velocity (WHSV of 45Lh−1gcat−1) decreased CH4 conversion so the reaction rate is also controlled by the bed length and hence favored the dry reforming reaction. The results of the reaction tests performed for 10h indicated that no significant loss of catalytic activity occurred during the reaction, therefore no deactivation occurred by coke deposition or metal sintering."

Furthermore, our algorithm allows the control of the gap between the two bounds by controlling the overall execution time. Therefore, a trade-off between prediction accuracy and computational resources can be easily made in our approach.

For commercial human spaceflight to flourish and expand, industry has to develop a notion of safety as the collective responsibility and common strategic business goal of all members. In 2004, the U.S. private spaceflight industry welcomed a law (i.e. the Commercial Space Launch Amendment Act (CSLAA)) postponing the ability of FAA to issue safety regulations, except for aspects of public safety until 2012. The deadline was later moved to 2015. The law, currently undergoing a second postponement until 2020, offers a historic opportunity for space industry to engage in the development of a comprehensive set of industrial consensus standards, based on the experience gained in more than 50years of government programs. This paper proposes framework and rules of an industrial cooperation for consensus standards, in the form of textual content for a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Those standards, when established, could become the basis of a mixed regulatory regime, where industry takes care of self-certifying the vehicles safety, while government regulators would continue to cover launch and reentry operations for all aspect of public safety. This paper also suggest to carry out standardization activities within the broader scope of a Space Safety Institute."

The structure of synthesized catalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. The catalytic activity of the MnO2@silk was examined in the aerobic oxidation of alkyl arenes, alcohols, and oximes to their corresponding carbonyl compounds and a one-pot tandem oxidative two-component reaction of aromatic hydrocarbons of petroleum naphtha in the absence of any other oxidizing reagent or initiator."

Silybum eburneum contains oil contents (37.7%) and low free fatty acid (FAA) value (0.16mgKOH/g). The synthesized heterogeneous nano-catalysts were characterized using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) techniques. The highest conversion efficiency was achieved (91% biodiesel yield) using MgO catalyst followed by Al2O3-CaO and TiO2 at 0.1% catalysts loading. The optimized experimental variables comprised of molar ratio (1:3), temperature (70 ͦ C), reaction time (3h.) and stirring rate (600rpm) using reflux transesterification route. The XRD analysis showed the sizes of the crystal lattices with a sequence of 13nm for MgO, 29nm for Al2O3-CaO and 37nm for TiO2 which reveals that smaller the size of the crystal structure, higher will be the conversion efficiency. The SEM of MgO showed exclusively porous lamellar like smooth surface highly agglomerated with nano entities with a particle size of 50±10nm length or width and about 20nm thickness. SEM images of Al2O3-CaO nano-particles showed the size range from 27nm to 75nm having irregular morphology including spherical as well as rod shape with smooth surface and different size. The diameter of the microsphere calculated was about 2–6μm. SEM for TiO2 demonstrated that the average size was from 68.7nm to 87.3nm with interring particle dimension. The shape was proved to be sponge-like with spherical nano-holes. The FT-IR and EDX analysis of the catalyst also supported the study results. Gas Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (GC–MS), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance NMR and FT-IR results confirmed the conversion efficiency of applying nano-catalysts. The results observed a novel finding that the conversion efficiency may increase with reducing the size and increasing the surface area of the nano-heterogeneous catalysts. The prepared composites are cheaper and can be applied for industrial scale production of biomass energy making it more cost effective and economically feasible."

The nanoadsorbent was examined as a versatile, potent, promising and sustainable platform for highly selective determination, separation and recovery of cadmium from the environmental matrix. Further, the sorption equilibrium followed Langmuir isotherm model, and the maximum sorption capacity was found to be 200 mgg−1 at 318K. The adsorption rate agreed well with pseudo second-order kinetics and the evaluated thermodynamic parameters suggested that the sorption process was endothermic, spontaneous and energetically favourable in nature. Desorption of cadmium ions was readily achieved with ultrasonic assisted mild acid treatment. Moreover, the stability and preconcentration efficiency of the recovered magnetic nanoadsorbent was retained over several separation cycles. Under optimal conditions, detection limit, preconcentration factor and relative standard deviation for six replicate extractions are 0.11 ngmL−1, 250 and 2.1% respectively.

In addition to entrainment of the clock genes, daily restricted feeding induces a locomotor activity increase 2–3h before the restricted feeding time initiates. The increase in activity is called the food-anticipatory activity (FAA). In addition to FAA, daily restricted feeding can also entrain peripheral circadian clocks in other organs such as liver, lung, and heart. This type of oscillator is called the food-entrainable peripheral oscillator (FEPO). At present, the mechanisms for restricted feeding-induced entrainment of locomotor activity (FAA) and/or peripheral clock (FEPO) are still unknown. In this review, we describe the role of the central nervous system and peripheral tissues in FAA performance and also in the entrainment of clock gene expression. In addition, the mechanism for entrainment of circadian oscillators by the abuse of drugs, such as methamphetamine, is discussed."

The procedure is based on on-line oxidation of ferrocene with benzoyl peroxide in gasoline-methanol mixture to color-forming ferrocenium-hydroxyl associate, followed by spectrophotometric determination in a stepwise injection system. The process of ferrocene oxidation to obtain color-forming ferrocenium-hydroxyl associate in homogeneous solution of gasoline sample in different organic solvents was studied. Under optimal experimental conditions (10mM benzoyl peroxide, 0.1mM HCl, oxidation time of 2min) the linear detection range was found to be 1–100mgL−1 in terms of Fe.

abstract = "A simple preconcentration method for zirconium based on coprecipitation with aluminium hydroxide prior to flame atomic absorption (FAAS) determination was established. The recovery values of the analyte ions were higher than 95%. Such parameters as the type of hydroxide ion source for precipitation, type of acid for the dissolution step, amount of Al3+ ion as the collector, pH, temperature, standing time and centrifuge time were optimized using 50mL of a solution containing 150μg of zirconium. The effect of the solution volume and influences of matrix ions on the extraction of the analyte were also examined. Under the optimum conditions, the calibration curve was linear up to 10mgL−1. The relative standard deviation for solutions containing 150μg of zirconium was found to be 3.9%. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were calculated as 0.17 and 0.57mgL−1, respectively. The method is capable of extracting the analyte in different samples with volumes of up to 250mL. The preconcentration factor for 250mL and enhancement factor for 50mL of analyte solution were calculated to be 250 and 40, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied for the determination of zirconium in glass and refractory brick samples."

Titratable acidity (TA%) increased (p<0.05) in the presence of fish collagen in plain-yogurt (0.87–0.95%) and in A. sativum-yogurt (0.77–0.95%) compared to in the absence of fish collagen (0.79–0.84% and 0.56–0.86%) for plain- and A. sativum-yogurt respectively. Free amino acids (FAAs) in all yogurts decreased (p<0.05) by about 1mM during yogurt fermentation. The presence of fish collagen in plain- and A. sativum-yogurts increased the FAAs by about 4.2 and 3.5mM respectively compared to their respective control 0.14 and 0.16mM for plain- and A. sativum-yogurts respectively. Effects of plain- and A. sativum-yogurts in presence or absence of fish collagen on the aggregation of milk proteins in yogurt was measured by SDS-PAGE. Some milk proteins, κ-caseins, β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin were reduced as a result of fermentation both in plain- and A. sativum-yogurts. The presence of fish collagen showed further proteolysis in these proteins in plain- and A. sativum-yogurts during fermentation and refrigerated storage. However, there were little changes in the degradation of α- and β-caseins in all yogurts with or without fish collagen. The extent of proteolysis based upon OPA values was the highest on day 7 of refrigerated storage in A. sativum-fish collagen-yogurt (337.0±5.3μg/g) followed by fish collagen-yogurt (275.3±2.0μg/g), A. sativum-yogurt (245.8±4.2μg/g) and plain-yogurt (40.4±1.2μg/g). In addition, plain- and A. sativum-yogurts with or without fish collagen showed maximal inhibition of ACE-I on day 7 of storage which ranged between 55% and 80%. The addition of A. sativum reduced aroma and increased graininess of yogurt but these and overall consistency were improved in the presence of fish collagen. In conclusion, fish collagen increased FAAs content in yogurt and the enhanced proteolysis of certain milk proteins may be responsible for improving ACE inhibitory activity and organoleptic properties of A. sativum-yogurt."

Our research revealed that, under controlled conditions, drought induced a wider range and greater uniformity of free amino acid (FAA) accumulations than have been previously reported. Drought stress resulted in increased dry leaf tissue and elevated concentrations of 7 of 9 detectable free essential (for insect health) amino acids in stalks, the chief food of Mexican rice borer larvae. Stressed sugarcane was preferred for oviposition, likely related to greater numbers of dry leaves and heightened host plant nutritional quality. Dry leaf tissue, which is not consumed, may be a cue for improving chances of larvae encountering nutrient-enhanced living tissue, and for concealing eggs in folds. Excised dry leaf tissue from the treatments was indistinguishable for oviposition preference; therefore, biochemical status of living tissue may provide oviposition cues. Varieties exhibited no major genotypic differences in FAA accumulations or oviposition preference."

The analytes reacted with 1-(2-thiazolylazo)-2-naphthol (TAN) to form hydrophobic chelates, which were extracted into the micelles of 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-114 in a solution buffered at pH 8.4. In the preconcentration stage, the micellar solution was continuously injected into a flow system with four mini-columns packed with cotton, glass wool, or TNT compresses for phase separation. The analytes-containing micelles were eluted from the mini-columns by a stream of 3molL−1 HCl solution and the analytes were determined by FAAS. Chemical and flow variables affecting the preconcentration of the analytes were studied. For 15mL of preconcentrated solution, the enhancement factors varied between 15.1 and 20.3, the limits of detection were approximately 4.5 and 0.75μgL−1 for lead and cadmium, respectively. For a solution containing 100 and 10μgL−1 of lead and cadmium, respectively, the R.S.D. values varied from 1.6 to 3.2% (n=7). The accuracy of the preconcentration system was evaluated by recovery measurements on spiked water samples. The method was susceptible to matrix effects, but these interferences were minimized by adding barium ions as masking agent in the sample solutions, and recoveries from spiked sample varied in the range of 95.1–107.3%."

We aimed to analyze the leaf anatomy of 22 plant species occurring in the Amazonian savanna in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, with the purpose of identifying key characters that show adaptive species strategies in their natural environments. Our hypothesis was that species typical of forest habitats would not present xeromorphic characteristics, while species typical of savanna habitats would present such characteristics. We fixed the samples in FAA50,11FAA 50 (Formaldehyde, Acetic acid and ethyl alcohol). that were stored in alcohol 70%, later they were free-hand cut with a razor blade and stained with astra blue and basic fuchsin. For the analysis of the leaf epidermis, we used the Jeffrey modified method of separation. Characteristics such as thick cuticle, epidermis with thickened wall and straight, presence of silica in the epidermis, tector trichomes, hypostomatic leaves, stomatic crests, dorsiventral mesophyll, presence of collenchyma and vascular bundles were associated with adaptive strategies of the plants to the environment of Amazonian savanna. The anatomic characters presented here are of great importance for the species that live in savanna environments, demonstrating plasticity and contributing to the protection of the leaves to the diverse biotic and abiotic factors to which they are subject, ensuring thus the survival of the species. We demonstrate that plant species structure of Amazonian savanna is most likely shaped by environment determinism, and this fact has implications on how we expect such plants evolve in a climate changing world."

The work analyses the emissions from the Amerigo Vespucci airport in Florence, Italy. The comparison between the present and the future layout of the airport, which is under project, is addressed, providing a possible tool to guide local air pollution prevention strategies within the framework of the strategic transport infrastructures development. The emission scenarios of the present and future airport layouts were estimated with EDMS 5.1.3, the software package issued by FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) which is an US-EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) preferred model for airport emissions evaluation. The total yearly emissions of NOX,CO,SOX,VOCs and PM10 have been assessed, divided into the main phases of the LTO (landing and takeoff) cycle, provided for each aircraft. The results show that the takeoff phase is mainly responsible for NOX,SOX and PM10 contributions. The AERMOD dispersion model was run over one year to evaluate the concentrations of those pollutants, modelled as chemically inert. The maximum concentrations occur close to the gate and the ground movement areas. However, the air quality standards ruled by Directive 50/2008/EU are never reached except for NOX, which shows an overall maximum of the annual average of about 40μg/m3, close to the standard for the vegetation health (50μg/m3)."

Their performance can be crucially affected by surface treatments, as it can modify the adsorption (and release) of these formulations. The role of surface modification on the features of 4-formaminoantipyrine (FAA) adsorbed on β-cristobalite (001) surface is studied by means of simulations based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT). Starting from the results of FAA in interaction with a dehydroxylated surface; a fully hydroxylated surface and a functionalized surface with benzalkonium chloride (BC) surfactant have been added to study the configurational landscape. Calculations suggest that the trend for FAA preferential adsorption on silica surfaces is: dehydroxylated>hydroxylated>BC-functionalized. The potential for hydrogen bonding causes the main contribution to the bonding while dispersion forces present an additional contribution independently of whether the drug is hydrogen-bonded or BC-bonded to the surface. Adsorption takes mainly place through nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic ring, the carbonyl and amine functional groups. Associated mode’s shifts and concurrent changes in bond length are also observed showing accordance between electronic and geometrical structure results. BC surfactant reduces the number of formed H-bonds and lowers the attractive molecule-surface interaction being it useful to prevent particle agglomeration and could favor drug release in therapies that requires faster but controlled delivery."

We conducted a feeding/spawning trial to determine the effects of protein source and protein–lipid interactions of channel catfish broodstock diets on egg biochemical composition and egg and fry production. A general linear mixed model was used to examine statistical significance (α=0.05) among the diets and to compare the main effects using adjusted marginal means (Bonferroni) in order to examine the significance of the lipid source × protein source interaction (contrast statements). All diets contained 36% crude protein and the broodfish were fed on 69d of the 141-d trial based upon a water temperature dependent schedule. Broodfish fed an all plant protein (PP) diet with 10% fish oil (FO) had lower spawning success (33.3%) than fish fed three diets containing animal protein (58.3%). Fecundity of broodfish fed a control diet containing fish meal (FM), poultry byproduct meal (PBM) and 10% FO (6432±1915eggskg female−1), or a diet containing FM–PBM–5% FO and 5% poultry fat (PF);(6420±1930eggskg female−1) was greater than fecundity of fish fed the PP–FO diet (1072±371eggskg female−1), while fecundity of females fed a diet containing PBM and 10% FO was intermediate (4060±1261eggskg female−1). Total egg production was greater for fish fed the FM–PBM–FO–PF diet (38174.6±11031.8eggs·tank−1) than fish fed the PP–FO diet (6571.0±2212.1eggs·tank−1), while fish fed the FM–PBM–FO (32114.9±7034.4eggs·tank−1) or PBM–FO (20619.3±6084.1eggs·tank−1) diets had intermediate total egg production. Broodstock fed the FM–PBM–FO–PF diet produced heavier egg masses than broodstock fed the PBM–FO or PP–FO diets. The number of eggs per spawn was greater from fish fed the control and FM–PBM–FO–PF diets than from fish fed the PP–FO diet. No differences in protein-bound amino acid (AA) or free amino acid (FAA) composition were found among eggs when only dietary protein source (FM–PBM, PBM, or PP) was examined. A significant (P<0.05) dietary protein by lipid source interaction was found among diets when protein and lipid sources (diet) were used to examine FAA composition among eggs. Eggs produced by fish fed the FM–PBM–FO diet contained greater amounts of total FAA, essential isoleucine and leucine, and non-essential glycine, than eggs from fish fed the other diets. Eggs from broodfish fed the control or FM–PBM–FO–PF diets exhibited greater hatching success and total fry production than eggs from broodstock fed the PP–FO diet. A diet can be formulated to improve reproductive efficiency of channel catfish compared to current production diets. Results from the present experiment indicate that such a diet should contain 10% supplemental lipid as menhaden FO or a 1:1 or greater mixture of FO and PF. Also, the diet should contain 35% crude protein from a variety of plant and animal protein sources. Broodstock performance was enhanced when animal protein sources (two or more preferable) comprised at least 15% of the total diet and menhaden FM comprised at least one third of the animal protein sources."

The parameters influencing UAD such as the solvent system, sample mass, presonication time, sonication time, and digestion temperature were evaluated. The efficiency of the proposed UAD procedure was evaluated by comparing with conventional acid digestion (CAD) procedure. Under the optimum conditions, linear calibration graphs in a range of 2–250 μg/L for Cd, and 50–1000 μg/L for Pb were obtained with detection limits of 0.56 μg/L and 10.7 μg/L for Cd and Pb, respectively. The limit of quantification for Cd and Pb were 1.87 μg/L and 40.3 μg/L, respectively. The repeatability for analysis of 10 μg/L for Cd and 100 μg/L for Pb was 2.3% and 2.6%, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated by rice flour certified reference materials. The proposed method was successfully applied for analysis of trace Cd and Pb in samples of various types of medicinal plant and traditional medicine consumed in Thailand. Most herbal medicine samples were not contaminated with Cd or Pb. The contaminant levels for both metals were still lower than the maximum permissible levels of elements in medicinal plant materials and finished herbal products sets by the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand. The exception was the high level of Cd contamination found in two samples of processed medicinal plants."

It consists of a preconcentration step based on dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) and measurement by flame AAS. Samples are dissolved in water. A mixture of carbon tetrachloride (extraction solvent) and acetonitrile (dispersion solvent) containing ammoniun pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (APDC) as complexing agent is injected rapidly into the dissolved sample by means of a syringe pump. After centrifugation, an aliquot of the organic phase is injected in the nebuliser of an atomic absorption spectrometer by means of a lab-made microsampling device. Response (integrated absorbance) was linear with concentrations up to 12 µg L-1. Precision (sr(%)) at the 5 µg L-1 level was < 3.1%. Detection and quantification limits were 1.6 and 5.5 μg per 100 g of honey respectively. Six commercial samples were spiked at the 10 μg per 100 g level and analysed by the proposed method and by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. The results did not differ at the 5% significance level, with recoveries for the DLLME/FAAS method ranging from 82 to 125%. The proposed method requires simple sample preparation and does not use expensive equipment, thus it could be used as screening method for the content of cadmium in honey."

Tests were performed on standard NIST-certified milk-powder to validate the reliability of subsequently collected analytical data. Ca presented a lower recovery value (85.3%). The finding for Ca macro-nutrient was found to be below recommended international standards (1300mg/L) for all samples possibly due to milk heterogeneity and losses in the pasteurization process. Significant results for Pb were found in all milk samples with average values at 0.230mg/L from a minimum of 0.062mg/L and maximum of 0.476mg/L."

A total of 97 different types of powdered infant formulae (preterm, adapted starter, adapted follow-up, toddler, specialised and soy-based formulae) commercially available in Spain were studied. It is noteworthy great differences in mineral (Ca, P, Mg) and trace element (Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn) contents found between analysed and listed in label information. The development of a fast, simple and direct slurry method for the determination of these essential micronutrients in infant formula by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) and flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) was performed in order to help in quality control tasks. Infant formula samples were solubilised using different amounts of several different solvents. An addition of 250μL of a solution 10% tetramethylammonium hydroxide and 25% ammonium hydroxide were required for the accurate quantification of Ca and P, Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu and Mn, respectively. The standard reference material 1549 non-fat milk powder was solubilised to compare the validity of assayed methodology following slurry nebulisation and traditional microwave-assisted acid digestion method. Good agreement of the analytical results by both ICP OES and FAAS, with the certified values was obtained. Method performance parameters (accuracy, precision and methodological detection limits) were determined for studied elements to check the quality and usefulness of the optimised slurry method. The analytical procedure was applied successfully to the analysis of a representative group of infant formulae. Levels of analysed elements were graphically represented, showing an acceptable comparability between slurry and acid-mineralisation method set by linear correlation coefficients and slopes close to the unit. The described simple and slurry method is appropriate, as an attractive alternative, for routine control analysis of added essential elements in infant formulae regardless of predominant protein type used in manufacture."

NaCl has a profound role on microbial development influencing cheese sensory and technological properties. The purpose of this work was to investigate how proliferation, distribution and autolysis of two commercial DL-starter cultures (C1 and C2) used in the production of Danish semi-hard Samsoe cheeses were affected by reduced NaCl levels. Cheeses containing <0.3% (unsalted), 2.3% (reduced-salt) and 3.4% (normal-salted) (w/v) NaCl in moisture were produced and analyzed during 12weeks of ripening. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), distribution of bacteria as single cells or microcolonies, their viability in the cheeses and cell autolysis were monitored during ripening, as well as the impact of NaCl content and autolysis on the formation of free amino acids (FAA). Reduction of NaCl resulted in higher LAB counts at the early stages of ripening, with differences between the two DL-starter cultures. The unsalted cheeses produced with C1 had retained a significantly higher number of the initial LAB counts (cfu/g) after 1 and 2weeks of ripening (i.e. 58% and 71%), compared to the normal-salted cheeses (i.e. 22% and 21%), whereas no significant difference was found between the reduced-salt (i.e. 31% and 35%) and normal-salted cheeses. At the later stages of ripening (i.e. 7 and 11weeks) NaCl had no significant influence. For cheeses produced with C2, a significant influence of NaCl was only found in cheeses ripened for 7weeks, where the unsalted and reduced-salt cheeses had retained a significantly higher number of the initial LAB counts (cfu/g) (i.e. 39% and 38%), compared to the normal-salted cheeses (i.e. 21%). In the Samsoe cheeses, bacteria were organized as single cells, in groups of 2–3 cells or in groups of ≥4 cells. During ripening the decrease in the number of viable bacteria was mainly due to a reduction in the number of viable bacteria organized in groups of ≥4 cells. A negative correlation between NaCl content and PepX activity was observed. At the end of ripening the total FAA content was lower in the unsalted cheeses, compared to the reduced- and normal-salted cheeses. In conclusion, NaCl had a significant influence on proliferation of both DL-starter cultures. However, the influence of NaCl on culture development was more pronounced in cheeses produced with DL-starter culture C1. As both texture and taste are parameters known to be affected by the development of the starter culture, the design of starter cultures for reduced NaCl cheeses is recommended."

abstract = "With the globalization of the economy, the aviation market competition intensifies and the aviation product development mode has correspondingly changed. The aircraft manufacturers pack more and more works to the suppliers to join the development work. The role of suppliers becomes more and more important during the development. Therefore, the problems of suppliers are following which have a significant influence on the aircraft design, manufacture and EIS which is means through the whole lifecycle of the aircraft. On January 16, 2013, an ANA flight made an emergency landing in western Japan after a cockpit message warned of battery problems and a burning smell was detected in the cockpit and cabin. At the same time, the FAA issued an emergency airworthiness directive ordering all U.S.-based airlines to ground their Boeing 787s until yet-to-be-determined modifications are made to the electrical system to reduce the risk of the battery overheating or catching fire. This is the first time that the FAA has grounded an airliner type since 1979. This event caused that Boeing shares has fell 2.6%. It is not the only accident of Boeing 787. Similarly, for other aircraft types, such as the Airbus A380, had to delay delivery due to supplier problem. It can be conclude that the supply chain management has an important impact on the aircraft development. From the perspective of airworthiness, this paper analyze the suppliers management of Boeing 787 Dreamliner battery issue and some advices are given to provide references and learnt lessons to the aircraft industry. The main content of this paper is as follows: First of all, the context and the purposes of this study was introduced in Chapter 1; the airworthiness regulation of CAAC, FAA and EASA about applicants’ supplier management are introduced. All requirements covering supplier managements would be concluded. Secondly, this paper focus on the whole process and solution of Boeing 787 battery issue and analyze the airworthiness problem of supplier management. Boeing 787 uses the lithium-ion battery which was produced by Yuasa and assembled by Thales who are integrate it into avionic system. Thales is the tie 1 supplier and Yuasa is the tie 2 supplier. This paper will introduce the whole process and the final resolution given by Boeing. Based on the airworthiness regulation, the airworthiness problem of supplier management reflected from Boeing 787 battery issue would be analyzed, especially in the tie 2 supplier management show compliance with the airworthiness requirements. Thirdly, on the basis of precious analysis, the actual airworthiness regulation would be concluded and supplier management of some international company would be presented as example. It is shown that development mode change has brought more problems of supplier management. Finally, this paper proposes how to fully meet the airworthiness requirements to suppliers management. Some ideas and suggestions are given to avoid the similar events and support aviation industry"

This work investigated the performance of Malpighia emarginataD.C. seed fibers microparticles (Me-SFMp) as biosorption platform for heavy metal ions. Integrated physicochemical analyses (FAAS, FTIR, SEM/EDS and XRF) showed that such ability was associated with the high microstructural porosity, wide surface area and diversity of functional groups on Me-SFMp structures, which favored the high and fast uptake of the target-substances (Cd, Zn, Cr, Pb, Cu and Ni ions). In terms of reactional kinetics, the pseudo-second order model showed better data correlation (R2 from 0.9992 to 0.9998) and suggested the chemisorption as limiting step of the reaction mechanisms. From the Langmuir isotherms (R2 from 0.9993 to 0.9998), it was observed that these phenomena occurred non-linearly on a homogeneous biosorbent monolayer. Me-SFMp can also be reused after desorption processes conducted in acid medium and, under ideal conditions (0.8 g biosorbent dosage; 100 mL of 1.00 mg L–1 multi-metal solution adjusted to pH = 8.0; 300 rpm stirring speed; and 60 min contact time), the following maximum removal percentages order was observed for the first cycle: Cd (100%) = Zn (100%) > Cr (95.1%) > Pb (86.8%) > Cu (84.2%) > Ni (81.0%). The procedure was successfully applied to remove the studied heavy metal ions from raw landfill leachate, even in the presence of several (in)organic interferers, reinforcing the strong biosorbent-adsorbate interaction and the viability of this proposal."

One milliliter of 1.0ppm of Pd(II), Pt(IV), Rh(III) aqueous salt solutions and a PGM-mixture were injected into the air sac on the 7th and 14th day of incubation. Control groups with no-injection and vehicle injections were included. On the 20th day, embryos were sacrificed to analyze the PGM effects on tibiotarsi using four spectroscopic techniques. 1) Micro-Raman imaging: Hyperspectral Raman data were collected on paraffin embedded cross-sections of tibiotarsi, and processed using in-house-written MATLAB codes. Micro-Raman univariate images that were created from the ν1(PO43−) integrated areas revealed anomalous mineral inclusions within the bone marrow for the PGM-mixture treatment. The age of the mineral crystals (ν(CO32−)/ν1(PO43−)) was statistically lower for all treatments when compared to controls (p≤0.05). 2) FAAS: The percent calcium content of the chemically digested tibiotarsi in the Pd and Pt groups changed by ~45% with respect to the no-injection control (16.1±0.2%). 3) Micro-XRF imaging: Abnormal calcium and phosphorus inclusions were found within the inner longitudinal sections of tibiotarsi for the PGM-mixture treatment. A clear increase in the mineral content was observed for the outer sections of the Pd treatment. 4) ICP-OES: PGM concentrations in tibiotarsi were undetectable (<5ppb). The spectroscopic techniques gave corroborating results, confirmed the hypothesis, and explained the observed pathological (skeletal developmental abnormalities) and histological changes (tibiotarsus ischemia and nuclear fragmentation in chondrocytes)."

The study was aimed at investigating exposure to welding fumes containing metals and fine and ultrafine particles. The studies were carried out at two metal industry plants during stainless steel and mild steel welding. Stationary samples of welding fumes were collected for evaluation of morphology and structure of fluids, using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). Individual samples were collected from welders inhalable breathing zones to determine the concentration of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr+6 and Cr+3) and their compounds in inhalable and respirable fractions, using flame absorption atomic spectrometry (FAAS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) techniques. The results indicate that stainless steel welders were capable of producing fumes containing carcinogenic and neurotoxic metals with concentrations exceeding Limit Values (LV)."

abstract = "Ocean acidification impacts fish and other marine species through increased seawater PCO2 levels (hypercapnia). Knowledge of the physiological mechanisms mediating effects in various tissues of fish is incomplete. Here we tested the effects of extracellular hypercapnia and acidosis on energy metabolism of gill and liver cells of Atlantic cod. Exposure media mimicked blood conditions in vivo, either during normo- or hypercapnia and at control or acidic extracellular pH (pHe). We determined metabolic rate and energy expenditure for protein biosynthesis, Na+/K+-ATPase and H+-ATPase and considered nutrition status by measurements of metabolic rate and protein biosynthesis in media with and without free amino acids (FAA). Addition of FAA stimulated hepatic but not branchial oxygen consumption. Normo- and hypercapnic acidosis as well as hypercapnia at control pHe depressed metabolic stimulation of hepatocytes. In gill cells, acidosis depressed respiration independent of PCO2 and FAA levels. For both cell types, depressed respiration was not correlated with the same reduction in energy allocated to protein biosynthesis or Na+/K+-ATPase. Hepatic energy expenditure for protein synthesis and Na+/K+-ATPase was even elevated at acidic compared to control pHe suggesting increased costs for ion regulation and cellular reorganization. Hypercapnia at control pHe strongly reduced oxygen demand of branchial Na+/K+-ATPase with a similar trend for H+-ATPase. We conclude that extracellular acidosis triggers metabolic depression in gill and metabolically stimulated liver cells. Additionally, hypercapnia itself seems to limit capacities for metabolic usage of amino acids in liver cells while it decreases the use and costs of ion regulatory ATPases in gill cells."

Extreme low air temperatures during the emersion of intertidal organisms at the northern intertidal sites render them vulnerable to freezing. To quantify the effects of freezing air temperatures on the supercooling point and freeze tolerance of Littorina sitkana from the upper intertidal, Nucella lima from the mid-intertidal, and Nucella lamellosa from the low intertidal, ambient temperatures were monitored with Hobo probes in two transects encompassing their intertidal distribution. To simulate the range of their emersion time the 2 and 5h supercooling and freeze tolerance of N. lamellosa, 5h supercooling and freeze tolerance of N. lima, and 5 and 10h freeze tolerance of L. sitkana were determined. Seasonal variability in the degree of hydration and free amino acid concentrations of these species was also determined. The number of days when emersion temperature fell below 0°C increased with intertidal height as did the number of hours per day when the emersion temperature was <0°C. The freeze tolerance temperature of these species increased directly with their intertidal distribution in 5hour emersion exposures and did not change with emersion temperature duration typical of their intertidal range. L. sitkana and N. lima were more tolerant of freezing in the winter than in the summer but there was no seasonal difference in the freeze tolerance of N. lamellosa. The supercooling point of the species varied directly with their intertidal distribution, did not vary seasonally and reduced the period of time during emersion when they were subject to freezing. Free amino acids contributed to the increased freeze tolerance of L. sitkana and N. lima in the winter. Although the total free amino acid pool of N. lamellosa was significantly higher by 30.6% in the winter than the summer, no single free amino acid was higher. There were significantly higher concentrations of total FAA (54.6% increase), taurine (22%) and glycine (2150%) in N. lima in the winter. There were significant increases of total FAA (27.6% increase), taurine and glycine in the winter compared to the summer in L. sitkana. These FAA are important compatible colligative osmolytes which enhance winter freeze tolerance."

This chapter uses the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Service Difficulty Report (SDR) database to explore factors that lead to undesirable events called unscheduled landings and determine which data mining (DM) model or models appear to be the most predictive of that event. The database used is very complex, and much of it is in text form. This chapter briefly discusses airline safety and data mining's importance in improving safety; introduces and describes the SDR database; and prepares the data for study. It further describes DM approach using STATISTICA by StatSoft and determines which DM algorithm appears to produce the most accurate results in predicting unscheduled landings based on error rate. STATISTICA can determine on its own what type of data is contained in the spreadsheet; it is often helpful for the user to specify the type of data. The SDR database contains a wealth of information that can be explored through data mining techniques to search for patterns and trends. One can determine that the aircraft manufacturer's name is the most important variable from the four selected, and stage of operation is the least important. Aviation safety has much to gain through the use of automated data mining tools and existing databases. The ultimate goal is to use the information DM can yield to drive the airline accident rate even lower than it is today."

Previous papers have already addressed the limitations of the FAA's uni-dimensional method, and proposed new approaches that take into account the two dimensions of “hubbing” activity, i.e., traffic generation and connectivity. However, these studies are biased by the lack of detailed demand data on international connections. Using an MIDT dataset comprising a sample of domestic and international markets served by US airports during the first quarter of 2013, this paper aims at providing a full picture on the pitfalls of the existing FAA method, as well as addressing the impact of international connectivity in characterising the airports' hubbing profiles. Hierarchical clustering is used to provide alternative criteria for hub classification within the context of US National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS). This new typology of primary US airports can help to optimize AIP funding by allowing for further differentiation in the FAA allocation criteria."

Atopic dermatitis (AD) shows dry skin. Water-soluble, low molecular weight components, collectively known as natural moisturizing factor (NMF), play an important role in maintaining the stratum corneum (SC) hydration. Previous studies focused on reduced levels of free amino acids (FAAs) in NMF from AD skin. It remains unknown, however, whether other NMF components are also altered in AD.
Objective
To characterize the levels of various NMF components in the SC of healthy subjects and in mild AD adult patients.
Methods
NMF components were extracted from three sequential tape-stripped SC samples obtained from the volar forearm. NMF components which were decreased in AD skin were topically applied to examine their contribution to SC moisturization in AD skin.
Results
We found that although FAAs levels were not remarkably reduced, levels of pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (PCA), lactate, urea, sodium and potassium were significantly decreased in NMF from mild AD skin. Among those components, only the topical application of potassium lactate effectively increased skin surface hydration indicating that reductions of lactate and potassium influence dry skin in mild AD patients. Unlike the distribution of filaggrin-derived FAAs and PCA, lactate, urea, potassium and sodium were abundant in the surface layer of the SC compared with the inner layer of the SC. Such findings strongly suggest that those components are supplied from outside the SC, i.e. they originate from sweat.
Conclusion
The reduced levels of sweat-derived NMF components in mild AD patients suggests that impaired sweat function might in part result in the SC dryness."

The samples were on-line preconcentrated at pH 4.5 through a mini-column packed with 50.0 mg of IIP-HEMA-BSA at a flow rate of 7.6 mL min−1 followed by a counter-current elution with 1.00 mol L−1 HCl towards the FAAS detector. The interference of ions commonly found in milk samples and the presence of BSA were investigated in the Cu2+ ions preconcentration. The method provided an analytical curve ranging from 3.6 to 100.0 μg L−1, preconcentration factor of 24-fold, limit of detection of 1.1 μg L−1 and sample throughput of 20 h−1. The accuracy of the method was attested by Cu2+ ions addition/recovery tests as well as by using GFAAS of samples microwave-assisted digested. The proposed method was successfully applied to the copper determination in milk samples, requiring only pH adjustment followed by preconcentration step as sample pretreatment. Copper content in bovine milk sample was 0.635 ± 0.042 mg kg−1, while to soybean milk samples were between 0.048 ± 0.008 and 0.094 ± 0.005 mg kg−1. To the best of our knowledge, the potential of IIP-HEMA-BSA for Cu2+ ions extraction from biological samples and simultaneous removal of macromolecules employing minimal sample pretreatment was demonstrated for the first time. The proposed extraction method stands out by being simple, fast and a low-cost analytical strategy when compared to the conventional microwave-assisted acid digestion."

To investigate the pharmacognostic characters of important medicinal plant, Artemisia parviflora (A. parviflora) Roxb.
Methods
The pharmacognostic studies were carried out in terms of macroscopical, microscopical characters, physicochemical parameters of A. parviflora. Samples of different plant parts were fixed with formalin, acetic acid and ethyl alcohol (FAA), sectioned with rotary microtome and studied under microscope.
Results
Some of the diagnostic features of the leaves and stems are the presence of amphistomatic epidermis, cyclocytic stomata, and collateral vascular bundles. Macroscopic study showed basal and lower stem leaves cuneate, oblong-obovate to flabellate, coarsely dentate to incised-dentate at the apex; middle and upper stem leaves mostly basally auriculate, palmatifid to deeply palmatisect or irregularly incised laciniate into linear to narrow lanceolate, acute segments. Further, ash and extractive values were calculated as per WHO guidelines. The preliminary phytochemical screening showed the presence of alkaloids, sterols/terpenoids, flavonoids, tannins, phenols and coumarins.
Conclusion
Various pharmacognostical characters were observed in study which can help in identification and standardization of A. parviflora."

The proposed alternative sample preparation procedure was fast, straightforward and inexpensive in reference to amounts of reagents used and the equipment required. It gave results statistically identical to those achieved with the reference procedure, i.e., the microwave-assisted wet digestion, validated by the analysis of a certified reference material of tea leaves (INCT-TL-1). Its analytical performance was also good and demonstrated by the precision (0.2–8.9%) and the accuracy (from −9.9 to +1.2%) of results. Recoveries of added metals were in the range of 98.1 to 104%. Limits of quantification of studied metals were in the following ranges: 0.1–2.4ngmL−1 (Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Sr and Zn), 5.1–25ngmL−1 (Al, K, Mg, Mn, Na and Pb) and 75–120ngmL−1 (Ca and Fe). The procedure was used for the analysis of 20 samples of different bagged and leaf black and green teas available in the Polish market. Concentrations of selected metals (Al, Cr, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Sr) were applied for the successful grouping of analyzed teas into four certain classes using the principal component analysis and the linear discriminant analysis."

Here, we examined the chemical and fluorescent characteristics of DOMPs derived from the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii and the dinoflagellate Heterocapsa triquetra, and the community and diversity responses of free-living bacteria to these DOMPs. The DOMP quality was evaluated based on amino acid composition and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) analyses. In addition, EEM analysis was used to examine compositional changes in DOMPs. The total hydrolysable and free amino acid (THAA and FAA, respectively) compositions of each DOMP differed between phytoplankton strains. In addition, THAA and FAA compositions in diatom DOMPs were slightly different between the exponential and stationary growth phases. Terminal restriction fragment-length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis with 16S rRNA genes revealed that the community shifts varied significantly with different DOMP additions. Furthermore, the specific amino acids in the diatom and dinoflagellate DOMPs potentially affected the bacterial community shifts. Similarity percentage analysis with 16S rRNA gene deep-sequencing revealed that distinct DOMP additions caused the community and diversity shifts with the growth of some specific bacterial lineages. Alteromonas (class Gammaproteobacteria) and Bacteroidetes lineages were strongly associated with the diatom DOMPs, whereas the proportion of Rhodobacteraceae sequences (class Alphaproteobacteria) among the total sequences increased in response to the addition of the dinoflagellate DOMP. EEM analysis revealed that the fluorescent DOM (FDOM) compositions of the diatom and dinoflagellate DOMPs changed in association with shifts in the bacterial community. Especially, a decrease in the fluorescence intensities of DOM was observed from the dinoflagellate treatment with the growth of Rhodobacteraceae lineage. These results indicate that there was a strong linkage between FDOM dynamics and Rhodobacteraceae lineage in the coastal water. This study suggests that DOMPs from different phytoplankton constitute a primary factor that alters the dominant bacterial groups with compositional changes in FDOM in coastal environments."

Consequently, it is a key factor to consider in studies concerning global climate change and agronomy. Among the main components of SOM are humic substances (HS), which are divided, according to their solubility, into humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA), and humin (HU) fractions. Study of the chemical properties of this organic matter is important for understanding the biogeochemical processes occurring in the soil. The aim of this work was to determine the metals iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al), using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), in order to elucidate the role of organic matter in the transport of these metals in Amazonian soils. The results showed that FA was important for Al, while the HA fraction was more selective towards Fe. The translocations of these metals to deeper profiles in two different soils involved either young and less humified organic matter, or older organic matter with a low degree of humification. Therefore, these two humic fractions were involved in the process of soil podzolization, with FA having a predominant role in the transport of Al, while HA was mainly responsible for the transport of Fe."

Three variables (extraction time, magnetic sorbent amount, and pH value) were selected as the main factors affecting the sorption step, while four variables (type, volume and concentration of the eluent; and elution time) were selected as effective factors of elution step in the optimization study. Following the sorption and elution, the ions were quantified by FAAS. The limits of detection were 0.05 and 0.9ngmL−1 for Cd(II) and Pb(II) ions, respectively. The relative standard deviations were less than 6.4%. The sorption capacity (in mg g−1) of this new sorbent is 179 for Cd(II) and 156 for Pb(II).

abstract = "Background
Exposure to flour/flour constituents is a leading cause of occupational asthma. Paternal occupational exposure to flour has been associated with increased likelihood of childhood asthma, raising the possibility of para-occupational exposure whereby family members are exposed to sensitizers ‘taken home’ on contaminated skin/clothing.
Objective
To establish whether workplace contamination of skin/clothing with wheat flour allergen (WFA) and fungal α-amylase (FAA) is associated with increased levels of these allergens in bakers' homes.
Methods
Bakeries in north-east Scotland were invited to participate. Control subjects were recruited from University of Aberdeen staff and students. Exposure assessment was carried out in bakeries, bakers' cars and the homes of bakers and controls using surface wipe and vacuum sampling; samples were analyzed for total protein, FAA and WFA.
Results
164 wipe samples and 49 vacuum samples were collected from 38 bakers (from 5 bakeries) and 10 controls. Compared to non-bakers, bakers had higher median levels of WFA and FAA in house vacuum samples; the difference was statistically significant for WFA/total protein (515.8×10−6 vs. 163.7×10−6, p=0.031), FAA/total protein ratios (1.45×10−6 vs. 0.04×10−6, p<0.001) and FAA loading (median 1.2pg/cm2 vs. 0.1pg/cm2, p<0.001) with workplace exposure–home contamination relationships between bakers with higher and lower workplace contamination. We found positive correlations between WFA contamination of the bakers' foreheads and cars (rs0.57, p=0.028), foreheads and houses (rs0.46, p=0.025), shoes and houses (rs0.45, p=0.029); and between FAA contamination of shoes and houses (rs0.46, p=0.023), and cars and houses (rs0.70, p=0.008). There was no evidence of bakers using work-sourced flour for domestic baking.
Conclusions
This work demonstrates pathways for ‘take home’ exposure of occupationally sourced flour. Taken with our previous work, showing that bakers' children are more likely to have asthma, this supports the need for further investigation to establish whether ‘take home’ of occupationally sourced flour is widespread with health consequences."

However, little is known about the effects of the kelp diet on gonad quality and consistency among individuals. In the present study, Mesocentrotus nudus adults collected from a barren were cultured in a suspended cage from late February to early June 2014 in Shizugawa Bay, Miyagi Prefecture. They were fed stipes of Undaria pinnatifida for 56 d followed by fresh Saccharina japonica kelp for 42d. At the end of the culture period, gonad indices, gonad hardness, gonad color (L* (lightness), a* (redness), b* (yellowness)), free amino acid (FAA) contents in the gonads, and sensory qualities of the cultured sea urchins (EC) were measured and compared to those of the natural population from the barren (EB) and those from the Eisenia bicyclis kelp bed (EK) in the bay. Gonad index and L* values of EC urchins were higher than those of urchins from the barren at the start of culture (SCB). Total color (L*, a*, b*) of the gonads of EC and EK urchins were similar. Gonad hardness of EC and EK urchins was similar and lower than that of EB urchins, and the coefficients of variation of gonad index, color, and hardness were lower than those from the barren (SCB and EB). Sweet tasting alanine contents of the gonads of EC urchins were markedly higher than those of the gonads from the other urchin specimens. Bitter tasting FAA contents of the EC urchin gonads were higher than those of EK and EB urchins, although arginine and lysine contents were lower than those of EB urchins. Sensory scores of overall taste of EC urchins were higher than those of EB urchins and similar to EK urchins, possibly due to the increased alanine content. These results suggest that gonad size, color, hardness, taste, and consistency among individuals of M. nudus collected from barrens can be improved to reach levels similar to those of urchins from the E. bicyclis kelp bed by cage culture with short-term feeding of Saccharina kelps. Changes in gonad qualities seemed to be mainly due to S. japonica as the food source because hard U. pinnatifida stipes were rarely eaten and had markedly low protein content. Extension of cage culture duration with S. japonica feeding from spring to summer would increase gonad size and further improve gonad quality."

The calculated flame temperature along the trailing flame decreased downstream due to radiative cooling, causing local extinction at <1250K and flame tip opening. As the mole fraction of agent in the coflow (Xa) was increased gradually: (1) the premixed-like reaction kernel weakened (i.e., lower heat release rate) (but nonetheless formed at higher temperature); (2) the flame base stabilized increasingly higher above the burner rim, parallel to the axis, until finally blowoff-type extinguishment occurred; (3) the calculated maximum flame temperature remained at nearly constant (≈1700K) or mildly increased; and (4) the total heat release of the entire flame decreased (inhibited) for CF3Br but increased (enhanced) for C2HF5. In the lifted flame base with added C2HF5, H2O (formed from hydrocarbon-O2 combustion) was converted further to HF and CF2O through exothermic reactions, thus enhancing the heat-release rate peak.

We found that the activity of AgRP/NPY neurons changed rhythmically during RF suggesting that these neurons are a component of the FEO. We next ablated AgRP/NPY neurons in neonates with diphtheria toxin resulting in the loss of ∼50% of AgRP/NPY neurons. Body weight and food intake were unchanged in adult animals after neonatal ablation, as were the responses to leptin treatment, leptin withdrawal, food deprivation and ghrelin treatment. However, ablated animals showed 30% mortality within 4 days of RF. Moreover, the recovery of body weight and food intake in surviving animals lagged behind controls with an absence of food anticipatory activity even after three days. These findings identify AgRP/NPY neurons as a key cellular component of the food-entrained oscillator."

Hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HTI), also referred to as hepatorenal tyrosinemia, is the most severe metabolic disorder of the tyrosine degradation pathway. HTI is caused by a deficiency in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), the last enzyme of the pathway, which catalyzes the conversion of fumarylacetoacetate (FAA) in fumarate and acetoacetate. HTI presents into two main clinical types, acute and chronic. The acute form, with early onset at birth or soon after, is mainly characterized by severe liver failure associated with cirrhosis, hepato- and splenomegaly, abnormal blood coagulation and hypoglycemia leading to death in the first months of life. Renal tubular dysfunctions such as Fanconi syndrome and rickets have also been considered signs of HTI. In the chronic form, onset is insidious and progress is less aggressive. However, renal manifestations, mainly proximal tubulopathy, are prominent. Patients show impaired renal tubular reabsorptive function leading to Fanconi syndrome characterized by renal tubular acidosis, generalized aminoaciduria, hypophosphatemic vitamin D-resistant rickets and growth retardation. In vivo reversion of inherited somatic mutations has been reported in a number of inherited diseases, such as adenosine deaminase deficient severe combined immuno deficiency, Wiskott-Aldrich and Bloom syndromes, epidermolysis bullosa, Fanconi anemia, and HTI. It is in HTI, however, that reversion has been shown to occur most frequently. A mosaic pattern of FAH expression was observed in hepatic regenerative nodules of ›85% of studied patients. DNA analysis performed on FAH immunopositive liver nodules showed correction of the HTI-causing mutation in one allele. The treatment currently used in HTI patients is administration of the drug (2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoro-methylbenzoyl)-1,3 cyclohexanedione) (NTBC) combined with a low-protein diet."

A two-level full factorial design (24) and desirability function were employed for the optimization of variables related to the system performance. The detection limits of 0.66 and 0.27μgL−1 for Cr(III) and Cr(IV), respectively, were obtained under the optimized preconcentration conditions (flow rate of 7.0mLmin−1), pH 5.0, buffer concentration (acetate buffer) of 0.01molL−1, and eluent (2.5molL−1 HCl) flow rate of 5.0mLmin−1. The other parameters including preconcentration factor (PF), consumptive index (CI), and concentration efficiency (CE) were found to be 17.62/32.98, 1.13/0.6mL, and 6.2/11.54min−1 for Cr(III)/Cr(VI), respectively. The developed method was applied to the Cr(III) and Cr(VI) determination in water samples [tap, lake and mineral water, artificial saliva and parenteral solutions (physiological serum, water for injection, and glucose physiological solution)]. The method accuracy was checked by the analysis of standard reference materials (trace elements in water)."

The sorbent was characterized by FT-IR, SEM, TGA and textural data. The maximum dynamic sorption capacity of Pb2+ was 42.04mg Pb2+g−1 of the double-imprinted polymer. The sorption kinetics data were described by a pseudo-second-order model. The double-imprinted polymer exhibited a higher sorption efficiency of Pb2+ than the blank polymer (non-imprinted polymer). The preconcentration procedure involved the loading of a Pb2+ solution at pH 7.25 through 40.0mg of the double-imprinted polymer packed in a mini-column at 5.0mLmin−1. The selective efficiency of proposed method for the Pb2+ preconcentration was assured by competitive sorption using different proportions of Pb2+/cations and Pb2+/anions. An analytical curve was obtained in the range 0.0–300.0μgL−1 (r=0.999) and a limit of detection of 2.46μgL−1 was obtained. The preconcentration factor was found to be 21, the consumptive index 0.95mL and the concentration efficiency 5.25min−1. The preconcentration method was successfully applied to the Pb2+ ions determination in different kinds of water samples with high recovery values (91.3–108.9%)."

Multivariate optimization was used to establish the optimal conditions for the extraction procedure. An aliquot containing approximately 120mg of the sample was added to a 500µL volume of an acid mixture (HNO3/HCl/HF, 5:3:3, v/v/v). After a few minutes, 500µL of deionized water was added and eight samples were simultaneously sonicated for 10min at 50% amplitude, allowing a sample throughput of 32 extractions per hour. The performance of the method was evaluated with a certified reference material of sewage sludge (CRM 029). The precision, expressed as the relative standard deviation, ranged from 0.58% to 5.6%. The recoveries of analytes were found to 100%, 109%, 96%, 92%, 101%, 104% and 102% for Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn, respectively. The linearity, limit of detection and limit of quantification were calculated and the values obtained were adequate for the quality control of organic fertilizers. The method was applied to the analysis of several commercial organic fertilizers and organic wastes used as fertilizers, and the results were compared with those obtained using the microwave digestion procedure. A good agreement was found between the results obtained by microwave and ultrasound procedures with recoveries ranging from 80.4% to 117%. Two organic waste samples were not in accordance with the Brazilian legislation regarding the acceptable levels of contaminants."

One of the objectives of this article is to reduce the ambiguity between ignitability and flammability of Mg materials and bridge the gap in understanding by clearly demarcating the tests and standards available for the two. Further, most importantly, the factors affecting the ignition temperatures of Mg materials and their mechanisms are emphasized such that an informed approach can be undertaken while designing the Mg based alloys for the aerospace applications. This article also demonstrates and emphasizes that the studies on the ignitability can be stretched to new classes of materials like LPSO (Long Period Stacking Order) alloys and nanocomposites in order to attain a maximized benefit in the existing domain of materials of Mg base."

Afterward, a Doehlert matrix was used to optimize the pre-concentration process. The experimental conditions established with this design were: 8.0mLmin−1 sampling flow rate, 10.0mLmin−1 elution flow rate and 0.02molL−1 buffer at pH5.5. This system allowed the determination of copper with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.5μgL−1, a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1.66μgL−1 and a precision expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD) of 2.70 and 2.79% for copper concentrations of 5.0 and 20μgL−1, respectively. A pre-concentration factor of 33 was achieved using a 50.0-mL sample volume. The accuracy was confirmed by analysis of a certified reference material (NIST SRM 1573a Tomato Leaves). Spike/recovery tests were performed with results ranging from 93 to 100%. The developed method was applied to determine copper in corn flour, cassava root flour, oregano leaves and cumin.

Seven PEG samples, five saturated as well as two nonsaturated FA samples, and two FAA samples were analyzed.

This chapter focuses on the process of obtaining permits for wind farms in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The regulatory process for gaining approval presents the first hurdle in the development of offshore wind technology in the US. Wind projects in the United States are currently being developed in three distinct offshore regions, which include the outer continental shelf (OCS), offshore in various states’ waters, and The Great Lakes. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) is the regulatory authority over offshore renewable energy projects on the OCS. In addition to a lease from BOEMRE, projects also need permission from additional federal agencies such as the US Coast Guard, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Environmental Protection Agency. The Crown Estate solicits and manages offshore wind farm leases in the United Kingdom and the primary agency responsible for permitting and consenting is the Marine Management Organization (MMO) or the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC). The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency, known as Bundesamt fu¨r Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie (BSH) in German, provides permitting oversight for offshore wind projects in accordance with the Federal Maritime Responsibilities Act and the Marine Facilities Ordinance. Applications for the wind farms permits within the territorial sea extending into the 12-NM zone from the shore are submitted to the German coastal states of Lower Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein, and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern."

Procedures and analytical figures of merit have been presented for the techniques called FAAS, SQT-FAAS and finally SQT-AT-FAAS with the relevant comparisons. Analytical parameters, namely composition of the aqueous medium, sample flow rate, flame conditions, distance between burner head and SQT, sampling period and type of organic solvent and its volume have been optimized.

The new sorbent, obtained by suspension polymerization technique, was styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer modified with 5-dodecylsalicylaldoxime-copper(II) complex. In flow mode leaching of initially imprinted Cu(II) ions from polymer beads was effective with 1% (v/v) nitric acid, however for elution of ions retained on the sorbent during the loading process sufficient efficiency was obtained for 0.5% (v/v) nitric acid. The most effective copper(II) sorption was observed within sample pH ca. 6.3 at flow rate 7.5mLmin−1. Furthermore, preconcentration studies of Cu(II) ions realized in the presence of popular foreign ions like Cd(II), Pb(II), Zn(II), Ni(II), Mn(II), Co(II) did not reveal significant interference. The expected effect of Cu(II)-imprinting was confirmed by higher tolerance level for interferents ions concentration for the new sorbent than for the control polymer. It was found that alkaline metals ions and humic acid had the most relevant influence on copper(II) uptake. Accuracy of the evaluated method was assessed for analysis of water samples (tap and mineral water, river water, artesian water) and certified water reference materials compare them to results obtained by inductively plasma mass spectrometry. The satisfactory relative error values obtained with use of standard addition calibration method, confirms the feasibility of this method for Cu(II) determination in water samples.

Two new sorbents were obtained by impregnation of MWCNTs with Cu(II)-LIX 622® complex, however in the first case modification was preceded by carbon wall activation via oxidization (Cu-LIX-CNT-A sorbent), and in the second one no surface activation was performed (Cu-LIX-CNT sorbent). It was found that effective leaching of initially introduced copper and Cu(II) retained in preconcentration process could be realized with the use 7% and 5% (v/v) nitric acid, for particular sorbents. Testing the influence of loading solution pH and rate of loading on sorption it was found out that optimal range of loading solution pH was about 4.5–6.3 for activated and 6.15–6.25 for non-activated CNT. Investigation of sorption kinetics showed that the process can be described by pseudo-second order reaction model. Sorption equilibrium conditions (90% sorption) for LIX-CNT-A and LIX-CNT were obtained after 8–15min, respectively and maximum sorption capacity for the new sorbents amounted to 18.1mgg−1 and 31.6mgg−1, respectively. For the examined sorbents enrichment factors increased with extension of loading time up to 180s: linearly for activated and non-linearly for non-activated MWCNTs. Influence of potential interferents such as Cd(II), Zn(II), Fe(III), Mg(II) and Ca(II) ions on copper(II) sorption on the new CNT materials was examined individually and with the use of 25–2 factorial design. The study revealed significant interference from iron, magnesium and calcium ions at relatively high concentrations. Applicability of the proposed sorbents was tested for Cu(II) determination in various kinds of water samples and the results were compared with those obtained with the use of ICP MS as a reference technique. Copper(II) determination in two certified reference materials: waste water (EU-H-3) and ground (ES-H-2) water was performed in order to assess trueness of the evaluated preconcentration procedures.

abstract = "Phosphorous removal using efficient treatment approach such as adsorption is vital for the control of eutrophication. In this study, nanosized Fe-Al binary oxide sorbent was synthesized through a modified gel evaporation method and employed for adsorption of phosphate from aqueous system. The nanosorbent was characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX), tunneling electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS). Langmuir model showed the best fit to the experimental data with a maximum adsorption efficiency of 16.4mg/g. Having all parameters optimized, it has been found that the nanosorbent exhibited 99.86% phosphate adsorption efficiency. The effect of co-existing anions on the adsorption of phosphate was also studied and no significant effect on the efficiency of the nanosorbent was observed due to competing ions such as fluoride. Desorbabilty of phosphate was investigated and found to be increased with increasing pH. The results of thermodynamic studies indicated that the process is spontaneous and endothermic. Both macroscopic and microscopic approaches were employed to predict the mechanism of phosphate adsorption on the Fe-Al binary oxide nanosorbent. Accordingly, the phosphate adsorption is presumed to occur via the replacement of surface hydroxyl groups by the phosphate species and formation of inner-sphere surface complexes at the water/oxide interface."

abstract = "Companies are facing increasingly tough competition in the global economy. Previously sustainable competitive advantage strategies are insufficient in the changed market conditions. The only sustainable advantage is continuous innovation at a faster pace than rival organizations. This requires a systematic approach to innovation and engaging staff on all levels to effectively take part in the innovation efforts. Toyota Kata is a proven and highly successful method for continuous improvement at the whole organization level. Toyota Kata was discovered by Mike Rother while he researched Toyota's quality improvement methods. It is a holistic system method for improvement efforts which contains processes and behavioral patterns for strategically aligned goal setting, problem solving, coaching, management and training. It is a simple and teachable approach which also covers the management of improvement efforts. The downside of the approach is its focus on incremental improvement instead of breakthrough innovation. The approach can be improved by adding TRIZ techniques like contradiction analyses, FAA, inventive principles and trends of evolution to various parts of the method. This approach will allow to keep the benefits of the Toyota Kata approach while changing the focus from incremental improvement to true innovation. The combined approach is also better suited for the more complex problems of today's knowledge workers. Toyota Kata can also be used as method for introducing and training TRIZ to the organization in an effective and incremental way. The combined method for continuous innovation can be further improved with the Lean Startup methods to validate the solutions. The Lean Startup experimentation approach is geared to design quick and inexpensive approaches for the market validations of service, management and software innovations."

abstract = "Understanding the current condition of complex systems and systematically improving is a difficult challenge, which many organizations are struggling with. Repeatable success requires the right method in addition to domain expertise. Lean value stream mapping (VSM) is a commonly used method that has been applied successfully in many domains. Despite its success VSM does have short comings when it is used to analyse complex processes where the value produced varies for different stakeholders and is largely intangible. Traditional VSM also lacks a practical way of modelling elements that are present in multiple steps of the value stream and a systematic approach to generating different type of improvement ideas (incremental and step change). This article introduces a value stream analyses method for complex systems, which combines traditional value stream mapping with TRIZ analyses (Ideality, functional world, FAA, perception mapping) and ideation tools (trimming, inventive principles, inventive provocations). The new method is designed to solve the weaknesses of VSM and enable systematic idea generation based on a holistic understanding of the system (including intangible perspectives). The method also integrates practical facilitation practices to ease the learning curve for participants. The article will also present two case studies from an IT company (change management and financial reporting and forecasting processes) and analyse results and benefits of the new hybrid method."

We propose a planning-constrained model (named PCGA-CA) that integrates cellular automata (CA) and genetic algorithm (GA) to simulate current and future urban patterns under the spatial constraints of urban planning. The planning regulations include three types: fully allowed area (FAA), partially allowed area (PAA), and strictly prohibited area (SPA), where we propose a planning implementation parameter (PIP) to represent the stringency in PAA. Under different PIPs, we apply the PCGA-CA model to simulate the 2015 urban patterns and predict the 2030 and 2045 scenarios for Ningbo city, China. The results show that the regulations substantially affect the simulation accuracy and urban pattern. As the planning regulations become less stringent, the accuracy decreases from 90.3% to 89.4% and the urban pattern becomes less compact. In particular, the urban pattern is the most compact when the regulations are not imposed. The PCGA-CA predicts the quantity and location of illegal urban development, and identifies spatially varying urban growth across planning regulations. For the same year, the urban patterns with different PIPs illustrate substantial differences in landscape metrics. The simulations of the current urban pattern should help urban planners and local authorities assess past implementations of urban planning, while the scenario predictions can offer a view of the future by evaluating the consequences of different planning regulations."

Also using the spectrometer system, the absorption signals of both iron and ruthenium, whose oxides had different thermodynamic properties: the latter oxide was decomposed much more easily than the former one, were investigated with a nitrous oxide - acetylene flame, in comparison with an air - acetylene flame. The fuel/oxidant ratio of both the flames as well as the height of the optical path was varied as an experimental parameter. The atomization behavior of iron and ruthenium, which could be deduced from a variation in their absorption signals, was considered to be dependent not only on the gas temperature but on reducing atmosphere of the flame gas, which might be attributed to reducing radicals in a fuel-excess flame consisting of nitrous oxide. In the nitrous oxide - acetylene flame, a broader optical path having a constant and higher temperature was obtained, thus contributing to formation of analyte atoms with a stable atomization efficiency and eventually to better precision in the analytical result in FAAS."

FAA were analyzed after suspending the samples in the presence of trichloroacetic acid in order to prevent dissolving the proteins, while TAA were determined after acid hydrolysis with 6M HCl in the presence of 4% v/v thioglycolic acid as a reducing agent. In hydrolysed samples 17 amino acids could be determined since tryptophan, cysteine, cystine and asparagine were degraded during acid hydrolysis. Linear regression coefficients (R2) were above 0.99 for all amino acids. Accuracy and precision, expressed as recovery (%) and relative standard deviation (RSD, %) were in acceptable levels, ranging from 78.2 to 123.3% and below 15%, respectively for both FAA and TAA. Uncertainty was also below 12% for FAA and below 22% for TAA. Sensitivity of the method was high with LOD values ranging from 0.003 to 0.034g/100g for FAA and 0.001 to 0.004g/100g for TAA, while LOQ ranged from 0.009 to 0.104g/100g for FAA and 0.002 to 0.011g/100g for TAA.

abstract = "Fire plays a role in determining the shape of the earth's ecosystems, impacts socio-economic issues, and influences our climate. In arid and semi-arid Australia (70% of the continent), individual fires frequently exceed 1millionha, and have collectively burnt up to 9% of the total area in a single year, associated with antecedent periods of above average rainfall which boost the fuel load. People affected by these fires – Federal and State governments, pastoralists, Aboriginal communities, larger towns, conservation park managers and tourist operators – all have different outlooks and priorities about these phenomena. Little objective information about the fire regime and its drivers has been available for this vast area with its very low population density. A predictive understanding of the spatial and temporal pattern of risk of large uncontrollable fires is needed to promote pro-active management. We present a conceptual framework which serves both to summarise existing knowledge and to reduce the complexity for a quantitative statistical analysis. This conceptual framework contains four main groups of independent variables; biomass, curing, ignition source, and fire weather. For these groups of variables we identified direct data sources or spatial surrogates. To quantify different aspects of the fire regime, interpretation of NOAA-AVHRR satellite imagery was employed, which identifies both fire hotspots (FHS) and fire affected area (FAA). For temporal variables, we present a surface displaying relationships for different combinations of lag/phase. This highlights different patterns for each region, and the most appropriate timeframes to use in modelling. Results of exploratory regression analysis in arid and semi-arid Australia show that the strongest influence is exerted by biomass or fuel load. As this is highly dependent on antecedent rainfall, we can anticipate a strong effect of climate change on the fire regime. The strongest combinations of relationships may be used as spatial indicators in the development of long-lead fire risk models for these areas. This can help improve the timing of pro-active strategies to manage fire, and in the allocation of sparse funds and resources. Our analysis has highlighted regional patterns of fire across different land tenures. Heightened awareness of these patterns may encourage a more cooperative and coordinated approach to fire management amongst stakeholders."

The detection limit (3σ) of the reagent blank for chromium(III) was 1.33μgL−1. The relative standard deviations for determinations were found to be <7%, and % of relative error was calculated <6%. The method was validated by certified reference materials of tea (GBW 07605) and bush branches and leaves (GBW 0703).

Oregano was harvested from the wild flora. The Cu and Zn concentrations that were taken into consideration (9.85ppm and 53.31pmm, respectively) were the consensus values obtained in an interlaboratory study. The piglets were assigned to 4 groups (C, E1, E2, E3), housed in individual metabolic cages and fed on corn–soybean meal-based diets. The diet of the control group (C) with addition of 1% inorganic mineral premix (MP), contained: 40.92ppm Cu, 144.96ppm Zn. The experimental diets differed from the C diet as follows: E1 – 3% oregano, 0% phytase (5000PU/g), 0% MP; E2 – 3% oregano, 0.01% phytase, 0% MP; E3 – 3% oregano, 0% phytase, 0.5% MP, E4 – 3% oregano, 0.01% phytase, 0,5% premix. For groups E1, E2, E3 and E4, 0.5% Zn of the MP were included in the diet, because the dietary oregano amount did not meet the requirements (NRC) for piglets. The mineral balance was determined during 3 periods of 5 days each. The levels of Cu and Zn were measured by FAAS in the samples (weekly samples/piglet) of ingesta, faeces and urine. It was noticed that although the dietary Cu ingested by the groups without MP was 75% (10.08ppm) lower than C, the absorption coefficients were only 47% (28.83) lower than for group C (54.22%), while in the groups with 0.5% MP, the absorption was just 10% (48.86%) lower than for group C. For Zn, where the amount ingested by the experimental groups was 33% (97.62ppm) lower than for group C, the absorption coefficients were just 20% (46.3%) lower than for group C (57.64%). No significant differences were noticed for Cu and Zn in terms of apparent absorption, between the groups with/without phytase. The deposits of Cu and Zn in the main organs and serum (from slaughtered piglets) were also evaluated."

Rainwater samples were collected using a purpose-built wet-only rain sampler designed and constructed at the Fatih University Department of Environmental Engineering. Major and trace metals in rainwater were measured using Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (GFAAS) and Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (FAAS) techniques. Statistical analyses show that the highest concentrations were observed for Al and Fe, which are mainly lithophilic elements. The lowest concentrations were measured for Co. Crustal Enrichment Factor (EFc) calculations clarified that rainwater samples were not enriched with Mg, K, Ca, Na or Fe, but were moderately to extremely enriched with Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, V, and Pb. The latter elements were attributed to a mix of local and long-range anthropogenic sources. Factor analysis calculations resulted in five factors with eigenvalues greater than unity. To further elucidate the geographical contribution from these factors, a potential source contribution function (PSCF) model was calculated from the highest quartile of the factor-scored trajectories for the five extracted factors. The PSCF results show that a significant fraction of the measured anthropogenic pollutants was transported to the sampling area from source regions in Europe, Russia, southern and northern Mediterranean countries and industrial zones west of Turkey."

Mice (n=30 males and n=34 females) were fed 70% of their own baseline ad libitum intake for 25days, after which their brains were collected and expression of various neuropeptides were investigated and compared between the 10 male and 10 female mice that showed the greatest (high weight loss, HWL) or lowest weight loss (LWL) (n=40 in total). HWL mice showed a differential neuropeptide profile to LWL in both sexes, characterised by increased expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AgRP), leptin receptor (ObRb), and melanocortin 3 receptor (MC3R) in the arcuate nucleus. No changes in the expression of fat mass and obesity related gene (FTO) or suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (Socs3) were observed. Levels of dopamine D2 receptor were decreased in the nucleus accumbens in HWL compared to LWL mice. HWL mice showed a stronger increase in food anticipatory activity (FAA) in response to CR than LWL mice.

abstract = "Circadian clocks drive daily rhythms in physiology and behavior which allow organisms to anticipate predictable daily changes in the environment. In most mammals, circadian rhythms result in nocturnal activity patterns although plasticity of the circadian system allows activity patterns to shift to different times of day. Such plasticity is seen when food access is restricted to a few hours during the resting (light) phase resulting in food anticipatory activity (FAA) in the hours preceding food availability. The mechanisms underlying FAA are unknown but data suggest the involvement of the reward system and homeostatic regulation of metabolism. We previously demonstrated the isolated effect of metabolism by inducing diurnality in response to energetic challenges. Here the importance of reward timing in inducing daytime activity is assessed. The daily activity distribution of mice earning palatable chocolate at their preferred time by working in a running wheel was compared with that of mice receiving a timed palatable meal at noon. Mice working for chocolate (WFC) without being energetically challenged increased their total daily activity but this did not result in a shift to diurnality. Providing a chocolate meal at noon each day increased daytime activity, identifying food timing as a factor capable of altering the daily distribution of activity and rest. These results show that timing of food reward and energetic challenges are both independently sufficient to induce diurnality in nocturnal mammals. FAA observed following timed food restriction is likely the result of an additive effect of distinct regulatory pathways activated by energetic challenges and food reward."

SCOPUS database was searched through February 2017. Studies were included if the article reported on both MDD and controls, provided an FAA measure involving EEG electrodes F3/F4, and provided data regarding potential covariates. Hedges' d was calculated from FAA means and standard deviations (SDs). Potential covariates, such as age and gender, were explored. Post hoc analysis was performed to elucidate interindividual differences that could explain interstudy discrepancies.
Results
16 studies were included (MDD: n=1883, controls: n=2161). After resolving significant heterogeneity by excluding studies, a non-significant Grand Mean effect size (ES) was obtained (d=−0.007;CI=[−0.090]–[0.075]). Crosssectional analyses showed a significant three-way interaction for Gender×Age×Depression severity in the depressed group, which was prospectively replicated in an independent sample.
Conclusions
The main result was a non-significant, negligible ES, demonstrating limited diagnostic value of FAA in MDD. The high degree of heterogeneity across studies indicates covariate influence, as was confirmed by crosssectional analyses, suggesting future studies should address this Gender×Age×Depression severity interaction. Upcoming studies should focus more on prognostic and research domain usages of FAA rather than a pure diagnostic tool."

These technologies change the characteristics and capabilities of the underlying computational substrate where services run (e.g. higher volatility, scarcer computational power, or programmability). As a consequence, the nature of the services that can be run on them changes too (smaller codebases, more fragmented state, etc.). These changes bring new requirements for service orchestrators, which need to evolve so as to support new scenarios where a close interaction between service and infrastructure becomes essential to deliver a seamless user experience. Here, we present the challenges brought forward by this new breed of technologies and where current orchestration techniques stand with regards to the new challenges. We also present a set of promising technologies that can help tame this brave new world."

In this paper, we firstly discuss the changing cloud infrastructure and consider the use of infrastructure from multiple providers and the benefit of decentralising computing away from data centers. These trends have resulted in the need for a variety of new computing architectures that will be offered by future cloud infrastructure. These architectures are anticipated to impact areas, such as connecting people and devices, data-intensive computing, the service space and self-learning systems. Finally, we lay out a roadmap of challenges that will need to be addressed for realising the potential of next generation cloud systems."

Desorption studies have been carried out with 2molL−1 HNO3. The copper, nickel and zinc concentrations were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The results indicated that the maximum adsorption of copper, nickel and zinc is at pH 5.0 with 500mg of MWCNTs. The detection limits by three sigma were 50μgL−1 for copper, 40μgL−1 for nickel and 60μgL−1 zinc. The highest enrichment factors were found to be 25. The adsorption capacity of MWCNTs-D2EHPA-TOPO was found to be 4.90mgg−1 for copper, 4.78mgg−1 for nickel and 4.82mgg−1 for zinc.

The physical-chemical parameters (temperature, pH, turbidity, solids series, total phosphorus, total nitrogen (Kjeldahl), and COD were evaluated every seven days, moreover the biogas production was monitored daily by a gasometer. The concentrations of Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe, Cd, Pb and Cr during hydraulic retention time (HRT) were determined by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (FAAS). Anaerobic co-digestion of swine and glycerin wastes didn't provided higher biogas production than the biodigestion without the addition of glycerin. The biogas production rates were impaired by the addition of glycerin doses higher than 5%, and the results demonstrate that the nutrient concentrations in the biostabilized waste are expressive for vegetal biofertilization, mainly for N, P, K, Ca, Mg and micronutrients such as Cu and Zn."

abstract = "Atlantic salmon farmed in seacage facilities are exposed to changing environmental conditions. While growth decline under lower water temperatures are reasonably well understood, the mechanisms behind production decline under high water temperatures are yet to be well elucidated and have been hampered by a lack of data describing pre- and postprandial patterns of endocrine fluctuation. The present research therefore aims to determine whether peak nutrient flux into the blood plasma is the most appropriate time point to investigate the endocrine regulation of growth and appetite under conditions of normal and high temperature, and to investigate the interrelationship between appetite and growth on a pre- and post-prandial time scale. Two experiments are presented which examine ghrelin (GHRL) as an indicator of appetite stimulation, the GH–IGF (growth hormone–insulin-like growth factor) system to describe growth-regulating processes and free amino acids (FAA) to indicate postprandial nutrient influx and link appetite and anabolic processes. Postprandial sampling of plasma and white muscle tissue from short-term adapted postsmolt was conducted at 13°C and 19°C at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24hours (h). The same samples were taken from long-term adapted big salmon at 12°C, −4, −2, −1, 0h pre-prandially and 2, 3, 4 and 6h post-prandially. While limited relationship between plasma ghrelin concentration and meal times was found for short term adapted postsmolt, clear ghrelin peaks were described for long term adapted salmon prior to the timing of anticipated meals. Possible explanations and consequences to experimental design in this area will be discussed. Postprandial FAA in plasma and white muscle from postsmolt was reduced at 19°C compared to 13°C and plasma levels peaked 8h post-prandially. Muscle Igf1 mRNA expression levels were consistently higher at 13°C than 19°C, with no clear postprandial patters. In contrast, plasma IGF-1 concentration was relatively constant over time at 12°C and 13°C, but significantly declined from 20h postprandially at 19°C. GH receptor (ghr1) mRNA expression in muscle was unaffected by temperature, peaking 4h post-prandially at both temperatures. This paper describes growth and appetite-regulating processes under conditions of normal and elevated temperature for Atlantic salmon, which is fundamental to our understanding of growth limitations inherent to high water temperature situations."

Contrasting with traditional methods, which employ a fixed transition energy and different analyte concentrations to build a calibration plot, MEC uses a fixed analyte concentration and multiple transition energies for calibration. Only two calibration solutions are required in combination with the MEC method. Solution 1 is composed of 50% v v−1 sample and 50% v v−1 of a standard solution containing the analytes. Solution 2 has 50% v v−1 sample and 50% v v−1 blank. Calibration is performed by running each solution separately and monitoring the instrument response at several wavelengths for each analyte. Analytical signals from solutions 1 and 2 are plotted on the x-axis and y-axis, respectively, and the analyte concentration in the sample is calculated from the slope of the resulting calibration curve. The method has been applied to three different atomic spectrometric techniques (ICP OES, MIP OES and HR-CS FAAS). Six analytes were determined in complex samples (e.g. green tea, cola soft drink, cough medicine, soy sauce, and red wine), and the results were comparable with, and in several cases more accurate than, values obtained using the traditional external calibration, internal standardization, and standard additions methods. MEC is a simple, fast and efficient matrix-matching calibration method. It may be applied to any technique capable of simultaneous or fast sequential monitoring of multiple analytical signals."

A new material was obtained from modified fly ash with NaOH and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HTAB) a cationic surfactant. Contact time, optimum amount of substrate and the pH corresponding to 50mL solution of pollutants were the parameters optimized for obtaining the maximum efficiency in the adsorption process. The optimized adsorption parameters were further used in thermodynamic and kinetic studies of the adsorption processes. The adsorption kinetic mechanisms, and the substrate capacities are further discussed correlated with the surface structure (XRD), composition (EDS, FTIR), and morphology (SEM, AFM).

Government authorities (such as law enforcement agencies), corporations and private individuals have identified the advantages inherent in the use of UAVs. At the same time, corporations marketing and manufacturing UAVs for civilian purposes, and the industries that support these manufacturers, have identified the enormous economic potential which may be derived from the sale and maintenance of UAVs (and the cameras and other equipment assembled into them). Hence, in the coming years, we will undoubtedly witness a rapid expansion of the civilian use of UAVs. Given the assumption that the entry of UAVs into the civilian market is a certainty, what are the possible implications for the fundamental right to privacy, and does the issue of permits for civilian uses of UAVs indicate that privacy protection laws are now irrelevant? In answering these questions, the article deals with five problems. The first problem relates to the fact that, although it is a fundamental right, the right to privacy is vague; there is an essential difficulty in defining privacy and the situations in which it applies, including situations that involve the use of UAVs. The second problem focuses on finding a balance between the advantages inherent in the civilian use of UAVs and possible harm to the right to privacy and other fundamental rights such as freedom of expression. As the article will describe in detail, it is not possible to determine, a priori, whether the advantages of using UAVs outweigh their disadvantages, or vice versa. The third problem arises from the possibility of restricting the use of UAVs, either at the data collection stage, or, alternatively, at the stage at which the data is used. As shall be explained, this is a moral question, the answer to which varies from one legal system to another. The fourth problem concerns the choice of Israeli law as the basis for examining whether the law can provide suitable tools to deal with the risks involved in the use of UAVs. In this context, it should be noted that although Israel is considered a leading manufacturer of UAVs, Israeli law is unique, inter alia, in light of the fact that the Israeli legal system combines elements of both common law and continental law, and the fact that regulation of the use of UAVs in Israel is in its infancy. The fifth problem arises from the element of uncertainty. Given that the existing system of laws does not provide a sufficient response to a possible threat to fundamental rights (in the instance discussed in the article, the threat which UAVs pose to the right to privacy), how should the legislature regulate the use of UAVs, without harming the delicate balance between the advantages and disadvantages inherent in their use. The article focuses on Israel as a case study and also comprehensively examines the solutions to the problems described above, as adopted in the United States and Europe."

Phys. Comm. 176 (2007) 710 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Problems that require potentially high orders of partial derivatives with respect to several variables or derivatives of complex-valued functions, such as e.g. momentum or mass expansions of Feynman diagrams in perturbative QFT, and which previous versions of this TaylUR [1,2] cannot handle due to their lack of support for mixed partial derivatives. Solution method: Arithmetic operators and Fortran intrinsics are overloaded to act correctly on objects of a defined type taylor, which encodes a function along with its first few partial derivatives with respect to the user-defined independent variables. Derivatives of products and composite functions are computed using multivariate forms [3] of Leibniz's rule Dν(fg)=∑μ⩽νν!μ!(μ−ν)!DμfDμ−νg where ν=(ν1,…,νd), |ν|=∑j=1dνj, ν!=∏j=1dνj!, Dνf=∂|ν|f/(∂ν1x1⋯∂νdxd), and μ<ν iff either |μ|<|ν| or |μ|=|ν|,μ1=ν1,…,μk=νk,μk+1<νk+1 for some k∈{0,…,d−1}, and of Fàa di Bruno's formula Dν(f○g)=∑p=1|ν|(f(p)○g)∑s=1|ν|∑{(k1,…,ks;λ1,…,λs)}ν!/(∏j=1skj!λj!kj)(Dλjg)kj where the sum is over {(k1,…,ks;λ1,…,λs)∈Zs(1+d):ki>0,0<λ1<⋯<λs, ∑i=1ski=p,∑i=1skiλi=ν}. An indexed storage system is used to store the higher-order derivative tensors in a one-dimensional array. The relevant indices (k1,…,ks;λ1,…,λs) and the weights occurring in the sums in Leibniz's and Fàa di Bruno's formula are precomputed at startup and stored in static arrays for later use. Reasons for new version: The earlier version lacked support for mixed partial derivatives, but a number of projects of interest required them. Summary of revisions: The internal representation of a taylor object has changed to a one-dimensional array which contains the partial derivatives in ascending order, and in lexicographic order of the corresponding multiindex within the same order. The necessary mappings between multiindices and indices into the taylor objects' internal array are computed at startup. To support the change to a genuinely multivariate taylor type, the DERIVATIVE function is now implemented via an interface that accepts both the older format derivative(f,mu,n)=∂μnf and also a new format derivative(f,mu(:))=Dμf that allows access to mixed partial derivatives. Another related extension to the functionality of the module is the HESSIAN function that returns the Hessian matrix of second derivatives of its argument. Since the calculation of all mixed partial derivatives can be very costly, and in many cases only some subset is actually needed, a masking facility has been added. Calling the subroutine DEACTIVATE_DERIVATIVE with a multiindex as an argument will deactivate the calculation of the partial derivative belonging to that multiindex, and of all partial derivatives it can feed into. Similarly, calling the subroutine ACTIVATE_DERIVATIVE will activate the calculation of the partial derivative belonging to its argument, and of all partial derivatives that can feed into it. Moreover, it is possible to turn off the computation of mixed derivatives altogether by setting Diagonal_taylors to .TRUE.. It should be noted that any change of Diagonal_taylors or Taylor_order invalidates all existing taylor objects. To aid the better integration of TaylUR into the HPSrc library [4], routines SET_DERIVATIVE and SET_ALL_DERIVATIVES are provided as a means of manually constructing a taylor object with given derivatives. Restrictions: Memory and CPU time constraints may restrict the number of variables and Taylor expansion order that can be achieved. Loss of numerical accuracy due to cancellation may become an issue at very high orders. Unusual features: These are the same as in previous versions, but are enumerated again here for clarity. The complex conjugation operation assumes all independent variables to be real. The functions REAL and AIMAG do not convert to real type, but return a result of type taylor (with the real/imaginary part of each derivative taken) instead. The user-defined functions VALUE, REALVALUE and IMAGVALUE, which return the value of a taylor object as a complex number, and the real and imaginary part of this value, respectively, as a real number are also provided. Fortran 95 intrinsics that are defined only for arguments of real type (ACOS, AINT, ANINT, ASIN, ATAN, ATAN2, CEILING, DIM, FLOOR, INT, LOG10, MAX, MAXLOC, MAXVAL, MIN, MINLOC, MINVAL, MOD, MODULO, NINT, SIGN) will silently take the real part of taylor-valued arguments unless the module variable Real_args_warn is set to .TRUE., in which case they will return a quiet NaN value (if supported by the compiler) when called with a taylor argument whose imaginary part exceeds the module variable Real_args_tol. In those cases where the derivative of a function becomes undefined at certain points (as for ABS, AINT, ANINT, MAX, MIN, MOD, and MODULO), while the value is well defined, the derivative fields will be filled with quiet NaN values (if supported by the compiler). Additional comments: This version of TaylUR is released under the second version of the GNU General Public License (GPLv2). Therefore anyone is free to use or modify the code for their own calculations. As part of the licensing, it is requested that any publications including results from the use of TaylUR or any modification derived from it cite Refs. [1,2] as well as this paper. Finally, users are also requested to communicate to the author details of such publications, as well as of any bugs found or of required or useful modifications made or desired by them. Running time: The running time of TaylUR operations grows rapidly with both the number of variables and the Taylor expansion order. Judicious use of the masking facility to drop unneeded higher derivatives can lead to significant accelerations, as can activation of the Diagonal_taylors variable whenever mixed partial derivatives are not needed.

Two irrigation intervals (I1: 4-day and I2: 8-day) and three plant-pan coefficients (Kcp1: 0.6; Kcp2: 0.8 and Kcp3: 1.0) were compared. Crop evapotranspiration (ET) and fruits yield increased with the increasing of irrigation water. The Kcp3 treatments had the highest yield, while Kcp2 had the highest irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) and water use efficiency (WUE) values in both irrigation intervals. The yields of Kcp2 treatments decreased only 4.87% and 5.93% in both intervals though total irrigation water decreased 14.3% compared to Kcp3 treatment. Irrigation water amount significantly (P<0.01) and positively affected the fruit number and fruit water content, whereas significantly and negatively affected the soluble sugar (SS), Vitamin C (Vc) and free amino acid (FAA) content in fruits. In conclusion, I2Kcp2 (0.8Ep with 8-day interval) was the optimum irrigation schedule for cumber plants grown in solar greenhouse under subsurface drip irrigation in arid and semi-arid areas that are in lack of water resources."

This method was based on the fact that Ni2+ could react with CMC and form water-soluble complexes, which would solidify in excess acetone. After centrifugation, the solid mass consisting of the nickel complex and free CMC was easily dissolved with water and the nickel was determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). Several factors influencing the recovery of nickel were thoroughly investigated and the optimized conditions were as follows: 5.00mL water sample, 0.50mL 0.5% CMC, 1.00mL of 3.0mgmL−1 KNO3 and 20mL acetone. Under the optimized conditions, the loading capacity of CMC for nickel was 20.6mg Ni/g polymer. The linear range was 0.025–3.0μgmL−1, the limit of detection was 0.019μgmL−1 and the pre-concentration factor was 4. Ni(II) can be well recovered in this CMC–acetone system from binary ions mixtures containing Zn(II), Ba(II), Ca(II), Mo(VI), Co(II), Cd(II), Mg(II), Mn(II) and Cr(III). The developed method had been applied to the recovery of trace nickel in water samples with satisfactory results. A possible mechanism for the nickel precipitate was proposed. The efficient, convenient and affordable method provides an alternative method for the recovery of nickel from environmental waters."

abstract = "Background/Purpose
Spastic hip displacement is a common musculoskeletal problem in cerebral palsy (CP), leading to further complications in daily life. Deformities of the proximal femur were regarded as a factor in hip displacement, and therefore, femoral osteotomy is often recommended. This study aims to identify the relationship between hip displacement and femoral deformities.
Methods
We retrospectively collected preoperative radiography and three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) images from 19 nonambulatory CP children with unilateral hip displacement (average age: 8.4 years; range: 4.4–13.6). The 3D image of femur was reconstructed for measuring the femur anteversion angle (FAA) and true femoral neck-shaft angle (NSA). The association among migration percentage (MP), acetabular index (AI), FAA, and NSA between nondisplaced and displaced hips was analyzed by paired t test and its correlations were identified.
Results
The FAA and AI are significantly greater in displaced hips (42.7° vs. 36.3° and 32.8° vs. 22.7°, respectively, p < 0.001). However, the NSA is similar between displaced and nondisplaced hips. The AI and FAA have significantly positive correlations with MP between nondisplaced hips and displaced hips (0.69 and 0.57, respectively).
Conclusion
Using reconstructed 3D-CT images we can directly measure and prove these femoral deformities. We found that AI has a positive correlation with MP (0.69), which is consistent with the results of previous studies. The displaced side has greater femur anteversion (42.7° vs. 36.3°), and coxa valga is common in these nonambulatory patients, irrespective of whether or not these patients underwent hip displacement. In addition, the severity of AI and anteversion angle will be affected by the MP."

Recently we reported that one of the serotonin-fatty acid conjugates, docosahexaenoyl serotonin (DHA-5-HT), previously found in gut tissue of mouse and pig, attenuates the IL-23-IL-17 signaling axis in LPS-stimulated mice macrophages. However, its presence and effects in humans remained to be elucidated. Here, we report for the first time its identification in human intestinal (colon) tissue, along with a series of related N-acyl serotonins. Furthermore, we tested these fatty acid conjugates for their ability to inhibit the release of IL-17 and CCL-20 by stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Serotonin conjugates with palmitic acid (PA-5-HT), stearic acid (SA-5-HT) and oleic acid (OA-5-HT) were detected in higher levels than arachidonoyl serotonin (AA-5-HT) and DHA-5-HT, while eicosapentaenoyl serotonin (EPA-5-HT) could not be quantified. Among these, DHA-5-HT was the most potent in inhibiting IL-17 and CCL-20, typical Th17 pro-inflammatory mediators, by Concanavalin A (ConA)-stimulated human PBMCs. These results underline the idea that DHA-5-HT is a gut-specific endogenously produced mediator with the capacity to modulate the IL-17/Th17 signaling response. Our findings may be of relevance in relation to intestinal inflammatory diseases like Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis."

In this study, a 70-day incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of different N fertilizers (urea, manure, straw) on N mineralization, soluble organic nitrogen (SON) dynamics and its leaching potential in typical agricultural soils of the Shandong Peninsula. The results showed that the addition of N fertilizers affected the SON pools and soil N mineralization in different ways owing to their various properties and interaction with soils. When comparing treatments, urea application was found to decrease SON content, whereas manure and straw addition increased the SON content after long-term incubation. Considering that SON content depended on a complicated formation process and consumption process, no direct link between SON content and N mineralization capacity was observed in different treatments. Additionally, we analyzed free amino acids (FAAs) in SON and found that FAA content was negatively correlated with N mineralization, except for the straw treatment. This suggested that FAAs were important substrates of N mineralization in soils. In addition, the composition of SON was determined by 3-dimensional excitation-emission matrix and ultraviolet-visible absorbance spectrophotometer after long-term incubation. The PIII+V/PI+II+IV ratio, SUVA254, and A253/A203 ratio decreased after fertilizer application. This indicated that fertilizer addition decreased the SON humification degree and increased SON leaching. Therefore, SON should be taken into account when optimizing fertilization management and evaluating the risk of N leaching in groundwater systems."

Random frog and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) were used to select key variables for partial least squares (PLS) calculation. For calibration, the best predictive performance was achieved by the CARS-PLS models. The coefficients of determination and root mean squared errors in the prediction set were 0.994 and 0.595 for TP, 0.986 and 0.070 for caffeine, and 0.993 and 0.063 for FAA, respectively.

The soils of 15 kitchen gardens located near two smelters in the North of France were selected according the ratio As/Cd. Four different extracting solutions usually used to evaluate the mobility of Cd were chosen to extract Cd from these soil samples: citric acid 0.11M, acetic acid 0.11M, calcium chloride 0.01M and water. The quantitative determinations of Cd in the 15 soils for each solvent were investigated by ICP-AES at two lines (228.802 and 214.438nm) and by FAAS or GFAAS with two-way background compensation. Compared to the Cd concentrations measured in the acid solutions and in the CaCl2 solution after the addition of a chemical modifier, it was clearly demonstrated that the high-speed self-reversal background compensation (HSSR-method) was the method of choice to eliminate the spectral interference of As during Cd determination by FAAS and by GFAAS. In water, it was shown that the deuterium lamp used for the background compensation (D2-method) was able to eliminate the most of the As interference. In comparison with Cd concentrations in water after adding a chemical modifier, those obtained with the HSSR-method were similar and a very good correlation was obtained between these two methods (R2=0.995). It was therefore established that the HSSR-method would be able to replace the chemical modifiers to eliminate As interference in the determination of Cd-extractable from As contaminated soils."

Environmental availability of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and indium (In) in 27 urban soils located around two former Pb and Zn smelters in Northern France were studied by analysing the chemical forms of these metals and evaluating their phytoavailability. These metals were determined using flame or electrothermal absorption atomic spectrometry (FAAS or ETAAS), depending on their concentration levels. After optimisation of the ETAAS method, characteristic mass of In in water and aqua regia were 9.9 and 18 pg, respectively, showing the high sensitivity of the analytical procedure. Metal partitioning was conducted using a four-step sequential extraction procedure. The results showed that Cd and Zn were mainly in the acid-extractable and reducible forms in the urban soils studied. In contrast, Pb and In were largely in the reducible fraction. However, in some samples, the amount of In extracted in the residual or exchangeable fraction was higher than that in the reducible fraction. Copper was mainly found in the reducible and residual fractions. A pot experiment was conducted in a glasshouse with seven soils (six contaminated and one uncontaminated) and two plant species, ryegrass and lettuce. The results showed transfer of metals from the contaminated soils to the shoots of ryegrass and the edible part of lettuce. The metal bioconcentration factor was in the order of Cd ≫ Cu > In > Zn ≫ Pb for lettuce leaves, whereas for ryegrass shoots, three orders were found, Cd > Zn > Cu ≫ In > Pb, Cd ≥ In > Zn > Cu ≫ Pb, and Zn > Cd > Cu > In > Pb, depending on the physico-chemical properties of the soils, such as pH, cation exchange capacity, carbonates, and organic matter. It was established that the metal toxicity was related to the contamination levels and the physico-chemical properties, including pH, organic matter, and in a lesser extent, Ca, Mg, and phosphorus contents, of the soils. However, it was shown that lettuce could grow on soils having high Cd and CaCO3 contents. Cadmium was one of the most available metals while Pb was always the least available in the soils studied."

The results showed that the whole reactivities increased with increasing RS proportion and gasification temperature. The transformation of water-soluble and ion-exchanged (ws-ie) calcium was enhanced in whole co-gasification and the ws-ie potassium transformation was obviously inhibited in mid-late reaction. Hence, synergy behaviours were synthetically determined by the enhancement of Ca deactivation and the strengthening of K catalysis.

Under the optimal conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) for silver was 0.45μgL−1, with sensitivity enhancement factor (EF) of 35. The established method was applied to the determination of trace silver in real and certified reference samples with satisfactory analytical results."

The relative standard deviations (RSDs) for Cr(III) and Cr(VI) were 3.3% and 4.0% (n=5, c=80.00μgL−1), respectively.

The manifold consists of several modules fully operated by a computer and connected with each other in a properly designed network. Its performance and usefulness were tested on determination of calcium by FAAS in synthetic and natural samples containing strong interferents. It was shown how GCS can serve for detection, examination and elimination of the interference effects. It was demonstrated that the designed manifold enabled to perform GCS procedure with very good precision, in short time and with very low standard, sample and reagent consumption."

For these applications, refrigerants with high ratios of cooling capacity to volume, or cooling capacity to mass are usually required. In this manuscript, two charts for the simple selection of the most suitable of several common refrigerants (CAA, CMN, CPA, DGG, FAA, GGG, GLF and MAS) are presented. These graphs are valid for single stage cycles. The selection of the refrigerants is uniquely dependent on the starting conditions of the refrigeration cycle (temperature and magnetic field density) and the desired final temperature. Only thermodynamic properties of the refrigerants have been taken into account, and other important factors such as availability and manufacturability have not been considered."

The Helios Rapid Ashing (HRA) prototype can reach up to 750°C using a ceramic radiative heating element. It allows for sample decomposition in less than 5min, and requires inexpensive sample holder materials such as aluminum foil and quartz fiber pads. Samples were decomposed at 500°C and the analytes were extracted into a 10% v/v HCl solution before analysis by MIP OES. Limits of detection for Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na and Zn were calculated as 2, 20, 30, 0.6, 2 and 5μg/L, respectively. These analytes were determined in a certified reference material of Tomato Leaves (NIST SRM 1573a) and in challenging samples such as cheese, butter, peanut butter, infant formula and biodiesel. No statistically significant differences were observed between certified values and concentrations determined by the HRA-MIP OES procedure (t-test at a 95% confidence level). General agreement was also found between MIP OES results from samples decomposed either by the HRA or by a conventional microwave-assisted digestion procedure. MIP OES is an efficient alternative to FAAS, with comparable linear dynamic ranges and significantly improved sensitivity. It has short start/warmup times (ca. 20min), runs on inexpensive N2, and may be a perfect match to the HRA system. The HRA-MIP OES procedure can be a simple, fast and accurate strategy for inexpensive and effective sample decomposition and trace element analysis."

A quick and simple method for the estimation of boron isotope ratios in high alloyed steels using high resolution continuum source flame AAS (HR-CS-FAAS) was developed. On the 208.9 nm B line the wavelength of the peak absorption of 10B and 11B differs by 2.5 pm. The wavelength of the peak absorption of boron was determined by fitting a Gauss function through spectra simultaneously recorded by HR-CS-FAAS. It was shown that a linear correlation between the wavelength of the peak absorption and the isotope ratio exists and that this correlation is independent of the total boron concentration. Internal spectroscopic standards were used to compensate for monochromator drift and monochromator resolution changes. Accuracy and precision of the analyzed samples were thereby increased by a factor of up to 1.3. Three steel reference materials and one boric acid CRM, each certified for the boron isotope ratio were used to validate the procedure."

We examine the economic and emissions impacts of this goal using renewable fuel produced from a Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process from renewable oils. Our approach employs an economy-wide model of economic activity and energy systems and a detailed partial equilibrium model of the aviation industry. If soybean oil is used as a feedstock, we find that meeting the aviation biofuel goal in 2020 will require an implicit subsidy from airlines to biofuel producers of $2.69 per gallon of renewable jet fuel. If the aviation goal can be met by fuel from oilseed rotation crops grown on otherwise fallow land, the implicit subsidy is $0.35 per gallon of renewable jet fuel. As commercial aviation biofuel consumption represents less than 2% of total fuel used by this industry, the goal has a small impact on the average price of jet fuel and carbon dioxide emissions. We also find that, under the pathways we examine, the cost per tonne of CO2 abated due to aviation biofuels is between $50 and $400."

The purpose of this study was to complete a follow-up to a study, initially conducted prior to a 2015 Germanwings accident where a European commercial airliner crashed in an alleged case of pilot suicide. In the previous study, consumers were asked their willingness to fly when their pilot was taking various medications (fluoxetine, loratadine, ibuprofen or clonidine); and the findings suggest that the fluoxetine condition produces the lowest willingness to fly scores. The current study was replicated longitudinally in the weeks following the Germanwings accident. The findings of the current study reveal a significant drop in willingness to fly scores for the fluoxetine condition immediately after the accident; however, there is no significant change to the other medications. After 12-weeks, the fluoxetine condition returns to its pre-accident levels."

The materials were characterized through magnetization measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of 29Si and 13C, elemental analysis, and surface area measurements. FTIR and NMR analyses indicated the presence of the ligand on the functionalized material and that it was coupled through a CS bond. TEM images clearly show that the magnetite core particles were effectively coated with a silica shell. The material presented a surface area of 287.99m2g−1 and an average pore diameter of approximately 15.1nm. The material had its point of zero charge (PZC) determined (6.17) and its adsorption capacity was evaluated as a function of time, pH, and metal concentration. Dynamic adsorption equilibrium was reached in 120min, and it had a good correlation with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model (r2=0.9997). The maximum experimental adsorption capacity (0.0786mmolg−1) and the value calculated by the linearized Langmuir model (0.0799mmolg−1) are very approximate, indicating the formation of a monolayer over the material. Furthermore, the material proved to be very stable, because their adsorption capacity remained greater than 95% even after 10 cycles of adsorption/desorption. A high enrichment factor of 98.1-fold was observed, indicating that this material is suitable for the preconcentration of trace Cu(II) ions before analysis through flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS)."

Commonly used as a vegetable, bottle gourd fruits have a peculiar umami taste that is important for their market value. To date, the umami chemical ingredients of bottle gourd fruits and their genetic determinants remain unidentified. In the current study, the relationship between umami flavor and free amino acid (FAA) contents was analyzed using a representative panel of twenty-eight accessions. Among the FAAs identified, free glutamate (Glu) was found to have the most significant association with umami taste, suggesting that free Glu is the main umami-conferring ingredient of bottle gourd. To further identify the genetic regions associated with umami taste, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for free Glu content was conducted in a diversity panel consisting of 139 inbred lines, each sequenced with a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) technology. Seventeen SNPs were identified as associated with free Glu content, each accounting for 7.5% to 15.1% of the phenotypic variation. The number of the favored alleles for each line varied from 0 to 13. Free Glu content exhibited a significant positive correlation with the number of the favored alleles. These results indicated that there is considerable genetic potential to develop new varieties with stronger umami taste through targeting more favored alleles of free Glu content. To our knowledge, this is the first GWAS study in bottle gourd. Our work reveals the genetic architecture of umami taste in the bottle gourd and will help facilitate molecular breeding of cultivars with improved flavor."

SLA was increased by an increase in shadow, while NOx and O3 concentrations had only a marginal influence. The influence of SO2 concentration was negligible.

In the presence of Cr(III) ion, selectivity coefficient of the Fe–CTAB-imp for Fe(III) were 261 and 267, respectively, which are much higher than that of CTAB-imp (1.61 and 1.32). The uptake capacities of the Fe–CTAB-imp were much higher than those of sorbents prepared without CTAB template. The relative selectivity coefficient of the Fe–CTAB-imp for Fe(III)/Cr(III) was 68.9 times greater than the Fe-imp. The sorption isotherms on the Fe–CTAB-imp conformed to the Langmuir equation, and the theoretical sorption capacity was 36.90±3.16mg/g. Furthermore, the Fe–CTAB-imp possessed fast sorption kinetics for Fe(III) from aqueous solution with a saturation time of less than 5min, and could be used repeatedly. Combined with FAAS, the method detection limit for Fe(III) could reach the level of 0.26ng/mL. This sorbent has been successfully applied to the separation and determination of trace Fe(III) in reference materials, artificial seawater, fresh water and nearshore seawater samples with satisfactory results."

By observing the actual flight-cancellation choices made by airline dispatchers, the airlines’ cancellation utility functions can be inferred through the use of binary choice models. The model captures how delays to a given flight and potential delay savings to other flights affect flight cancellation decisions. We also find larger, fuller, less frequent, shorter-distance, and spoke-bound flights are less likely to be cancelled, and that there is inter-airline variation in flight cancellation behaviour."

abstract = "Free amino acid concentrations and nitrogen (N) isotopic composition in new current-year (new), mature current-year (middle-aged) and previous-year (old) Masson pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb.) needles were determined to indicate atmospheric N deposition in Guiyang (SW China). In different areas, free amino acids (especially arginine) concentrations in new and middle-aged needles were higher than in old needles, and the variation of free amino acids (especially arginine) concentrations in new and middle-aged needles was also greater than in old needles. This indicate that free amino acids in new and middle-aged needles may be more sensitive to N deposition compared to old needles. Moreover, concentrations of total free amino acids, arginine, histidine, γ-aminobutyric acid and alanine in middle-aged needles exhibited a strong relationship with N deposition (P < 0.05). Needle δ15N values showed a strong gradient from central Guiyang to the rural area, with more positive δ15N (especially in old needles) in the city center (0–5 km) and more negative δ15N (especially in old needles) in rural area (30–35 km). These suggest that N deposition in the urban center may be dominated by 15N-enriched NOx-N from traffic exhausts, while it is dominated by isotopically light atmospheric NHx-N from agriculture in rural area. Soil δ15N decreased slightly with distance from the city center, and the difference in δ15N values between the soil and needles (especially for old needles) increased significantly with the distance gradient, indicating that atmospheric N deposition may be an important N source for needles. This study provides novel evidence that free amino acids in needles and age-dependent needle δ15N values are useful indicators of atmospheric N deposition."

Needle free amino acid concentrations decreased with increasing distance from the highway, and only the free amino acid concentrations (total free amino acid, arginine, γ-aminobutyric acid, valine, alanine and proline) in the middle-aged needles demonstrated a strong correlation with distance from the highway, indicating that free amino acid concentrations in middle-aged needles may be a more suitable indicator of nitrogen (N) deposition compared to new and old needles. Needle free amino acid δ15N values were more positive near the highway compared to the more distant sites and increased with increasing needle age, indicating that N deposition in this site may be dominated by isotopically heavy NOx-N from traffic emissions. In sites beyond 400 m from the highway, the δ15N values of total free amino acids, histidine, glutamine, proline, alanine, aspartate, isoleucine, lysine, arginine and serine in each age of needle were noticeably negative compared to their respective δ15N values near the highway. This suggested that needle free amino acid δ15N values from these sites were more affected by 15N-depleted atmospheric NHx-N from soil emissions. This result was further supported by the similarity in the negative moss δ15N values at these sites to the δ15N values of soil-derived NHx-N. Needle free amino acid δ15N values therefore have the potential to provide information about atmospheric N sources. We conclude that needle free amino acid concentrations are sensitive indicators of N deposition and that the age-related free amino acid δ15N values in needles can efficiently reflect atmospheric N sources. This would probably promote the application of the combined plant tissue amino acid concentration and δ15N analyses in N deposition bio-monitoring."

A time- and/or concentration- dependent decrease in muscle glycogen and increase in LDH activity suggested that glycolysis was accelerated during the treatments. Increased protease activity, lowering of FAA and the initially increased and subsequently decreased aminotransferase activities suggest an enhanced protein mobilization during early Cd2+ exposure followed by a metabolic impairment during late exposure. Decreased hemolymph glucose level was observed in the crabs treated with 2.9mg·L−1 Cd2+ for 21d, suggesting an impaired gluconeogenesis. Ammonia level barely changed during the 14d Cd2+ exposure most likely due to the increased urea and glutamine production; After 1.45 and 2.9mg·L−1 Cd2+ treatment for 21d, ammonia was observed increased followed by an exclusive increase in glutamine. Taken together, our results indicate that carbohydrate and protein are mobilized to a varying degree as a compensatory metabolism to response to the energy stress during acute Cd2+ exposure. As the time lapsed, some symptoms on metabolism obstacle reflect the toxic effect of sublethal Cd2+."

In recent years, the development of autonomous surface vehicles has been a field of increasing research interest. There are two major areas in this field: control theory and path planning. This study focuses on path planning, and two objectives are discussed: path planning for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) and implementation of path planning in a real map. In this paper, satellite thermal images are converted into binary images which are used as the maps for the Finite Angle A * algorithm (FAA *), an advanced A * algorithm that is used to determine safer and suboptimal paths for USVs. To plan a collision-free path, the algorithm proposed in this article considers the dimensions of surface vehicles. Furthermore, the turning ability of a surface vehicle is also considered, and a constraint condition is introduced to improve the quality of the path planning algorithm, which makes the traveled path smoother. This study also shows a path planning experiment performed on a real satellite thermal image, and the path planning results can be used by an USV"

However, the foamed concrete, which is used as the EMAS core at present, has drawn increasing criticism from the public opinion for environmental issue and aging problem. In this paper, a new arresting system made of polyurethane foam with high energy absorption capacity was proposed to overcome the above problems. An analytical model based on the Avalle empirical model, which takes into account the coupling effect between the aircraft wheel and the foam material, was presented to estimate the horizontal resistances exerted on the aircraft wheel, including the crushing drag, the tearing drag, the adhesive drag and the friction drag. In addition, the stopping distance required to arrest the overrun aircraft was predicted. Furthermore, the accuracy of the theoretical results was validated through comparison with the results of FAA full-scale arresting tests. Besides, the influences of the arrestor height, material strength, aircraft weight and the radius of aircraft wheel on the arresting performance of polyurethane foam material were performed, indicating that a reasonable parametric selection is extremely crucial to obtain the optimal design for the aircraft arresting system."

When the temperature increases above its cloud point, the Ag (I)/DDTC complexes are extracted into the surfactant-rich phase. The factors affecting the extraction efficiency including pH of the aqueous solution, concentration of the DDTC, amount of the surfactant, incubation temperature and time were investigated and optimized. Under the optimal experimental conditions, no interference was observed for the determination of 100ng·mL−1 Ag+ in the presence of various cations below their maximum concentrations allowed in this method, for instance, 50μg·mL−1 for both Zn2+ and Cu2+, 80μg·mL−1 for Pb2+, 1000μg·mL−1 for Mn2+, and 100μg·mL−1 for both Cd2+ and Ni2+. The calibration curve was linear in the range of 1–500ng·mL−1 with a limit of detection (LOD) at 0.3ng·mL−1.

To reduce the runway safety risk has remained a top priority for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in recent decades. In order to prevent the disasters, an innovative civil aircraft arresting system called Engineered Material Arresting System (EMAS) has been installed at the terminal of Runway Safety Areas (RSA) in the main international airports around the world. EMAS has already succeeded in keeping the airplanes on the runway and it has proved to be an effective technique to mitigate overruns that take place. This paper provides a systematic overview of the recent research efforts and advancements about the civil aircraft arresting system, with a focus on the concept introduction, structural construction, standard EMAS, installation and maintenance of EMAS. Furthermore, the major research approaches for the civil aircraft arresting system, such as the representative theoretical models, numerical simulations and full-scale aircraft arresting experiments, are highlighted and discussed to clarify the energy absorption mechanism of the aircraft arresting system. The current operational performance of the aircraft arresting systems and successful arresting cases for the airplanes that overshot the runway are described in this paper. The main shortcomings of the current aircraft arresting systems are pointed out based on the investigation of the current service condition for the EMAS, and then some novel arresting systems promising to replace the current core material for EMAS are listed."

abstract = "The comprehensive utilization of the excellent magnetic properties and advanced catalytic ability of Fe-based amorphous alloys (FAAs) is reported for the first time. A novel Fe63Cr5Nb4Y6B22 (at%) amorphous alloy that has ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition near room temperature and good catalytic performance for methylene blue degradation is successfully synthesized. The alloy is applicable for automatically recycled dye degradation with its thermal-tuning magnetic behavior. When an external dye wastewater is applied (high temperature), the FAAs are paramagnetic and disperse into water to participate in degradation. When the wastewater has been degraded and the temperature drops to room temperature, the FAAs change to ferromagnetic and the remediated water can be released. This alloy exhibits a low thermal activation energy barrier of 21.8 kJ/mol due to the reduced atomic bonding forces with Cr addition, and has excellent catalytic performance at high temperature (323–343 K) and in acidic solution (pH = 3). The excellent chemical properties are mainly attributed to the heterogeneous structure consisting of local Fe-rich and Fe-poor atomic clusters. The present findings not only provide a new, highly efficient and low cost commercial method for wastewater treatments, but also shed light on the comprehensive utilization of the magnetic and chemical properties of FAAs."

Effects of boiling, ultra-high temperature (UHT) and high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) on CRW quality were investigated. Thermal treatment resulted in a decrease of total free amino-acids (FAA), whereas HHP-treatment caused an increase. However, UHT and HHP treatments had little effect on FAA with sweet and umami-like flavor. HHP-treated CRW contained 7.35% higher content of flavors relative to untreated wine, while thermally-treated CRW revealed 4.68–8.61% losses. Based on principal component analysis, CRW processed at 400 or 600 MPa for 10 min exhibited similar flavor to the untreated wine, which was highly associated with long-chain fatty acid ethyl esters (C13–C18). Moreover, partial least squares regression demonstrated that sensory attributes of cereal aroma and astringency were highlighted after thermal treatment, while fruit aroma, continuation and full body were dominant after HHP treatment. HHP treatment effectively enhanced the quality of CRW, which could be applied in other alcoholic beverages."

The separation/preconcentration conditions of Cr(VI) was investigated, including the pH value, shaking time, adsorption temperature, sample volume, desorption conditions and interfering ions. The results showed the adsorption properties of the TEPA-NMPs were highly pH dependent. The data of adsorption kinetics obeyed pseudo-second-order rate mechanism well. Adsorption thermodynamic studies suggested that the adsorption processes of Cr(VI) onto the TEPA-NMPs was endothermic and entropy favored in nature. Under the best experimental conditions, the enhancement factor was 125 times, the detection limit of the method was 0.16μgL−1 and the relative standard deviation was 1.9% (n=7). Furthermore, the developed method was validated by comparing with Graphite Furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GF-AAS) method, and has been applied for the determination of ultratrace Cr(VI) ions in the river and tap water samples with satisfactory results, which revealed the sensitivity of the proposed TEPA-NMPs MSPD-FAAS method was comparable with that of GF-AAS method."

Although the problem of function placement and scheduling in NFV has drawn much attention in recent years, existing studies only consider the precedence constraints between network functions within a service but lacking for the interactions among services. In this paper, under the premise of satisfying the precedence conditions of forming the service chain, we study how to minimize the completion time of the whole system through efficient mapping and preemptive scheduling of functions for multiple service chains. We firstly model this issue as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. To avoid the computational complexity of ILP, an online preemptive algorithm is designed. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The simulation results indicate that our algorithm is suitable for placement and scheduling of functions for multiple service chains in NFV."

abstract = "The introduction, originally in 2009, by the FAA of a ‘slow growth’ approach to the certification of polymer-matrix fibre composites has focused attention on the experimental data and the analytical tools needed to assess the growth of delaminations under cyclic-fatigue loads. Of direct relevance is the fact that fatigue tests on aircraft composite components and structures reveal that no, or only little, retardation of the fatigue crack growth (FCG) rate occurs as delamination/impact damage grows. Therefore, of course, the FCG data that are ascertained in laboratory tests, and then employed as a material-allowable property to design and life the structure, as well as for the development, characterisation and comparison of composite materials, must also exhibit no, or only minimal, retardation. Now, in laboratory tests the double-cantilever beam (DCB) test, using a typical carbon-fibre reinforced-plastic (CFRP) aerospace composite, is usually employed to obtain fracture-mechanics data under cyclic-fatigue Mode I loading. However, it is extremely difficult to perform such DCB fatigue tests without extensive fibre-bridging developing across the crack faces. This fibre-bridging leads to significant retardation of the FCG rate. Such fibre-bridging, and hence retardation of the FCG, is seen to arise even for the smallest values of the pre-crack extension length, ap − a0, that are typically employed. The results from the DCB tests also invariably exhibit a relatively large degree of inherent scatter. Thus, a methodology is proposed for predicting an ‘upper-bound’ FCG curve from the laboratory test data which is representative of a composite laminate exhibiting no, or only very little, retardation of the FCG rate under fatigue loading and which takes into account the inherent scatter. To achieve this we have employed a novel methodology, based on using a variant of the Hartman-Schijve equation, to access this ‘upper-bound’ FCG rate curve, which may be thought of as a material-allowable property and which is obtained using an ‘A basis’ statistical approach. Therefore, a conservative ‘upper-bound’ FCG curve may now be calculated from the DCB laboratory test data for material development, characterisation and comparative studies, and for design and lifing studies."

The factors influencing the crystallization process such as initial concentration, temperature and stirring speed were investigated and discussed. In the experiment, CO2 was stripped from a slightly acidic solution of LiHCO3 by stirring resulting in critical supersaturation and precipitation of Li2CO3. The reduction of the Li+ concentration was recorded as a function of time by determination with flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS), and the pH values were also measured. The results showed that the crystallization rate increased and the induction period shortened with increase in the initial concentration and temperature. In addition, high stirring speed could significantly promote this process. Thermodynamic parameters at critical conditions such as the surface free energy and critical radius of nucleus were estimated based on the crystallization theory and experimental results. The results showed that the crystallization kinetics of this process coincided with the second-order reaction rate equation, and the apparent activation energy of the process was obtained. The analysis of the crystal growth mechanism showed that the growth of Li2CO3 from LiHCO3 solutions was mainly controlled by diffusion."

The ultrasound assisted-enzyme based hydrolytic microextraction method (UA-EH-ME) was applied for the separation and determination of manganese in food samples prior to its micro-sampling flame atomic absorption spectrometric determination (MS-FAAS). Analytical parameters influenced on the enzyme based hydrolytic microextraction method such as pH, type of enzyme, amount of enzyme, temperature and time of ultrasonic waves were fully evaluated and optimized by using mg level of NCS ZC73033 scallion certified reference material. In the presented method, total manganese in 5.0mg of food samples was extracted to 800µL of aqueous phase at pH 1.0 by 0.75mg of pepsin as microextraction agent (hydrolytic enzyme). The procedure can be completed in 15min. These values are optimized conditions for the quantitative extraction of manganese from food samples. The most important advantage of the UA-EH-ME procedure is the using of mg level of pepsin for breaking down certain bonds of bio-molecules for extraction of manganese in very low levels of food samples. The limit of detection (LOD), the limit of quantification (LOQ), and relative standard deviation were found as 4.9mgkg−1, 16.3mgkg−1 and 4.8%, respectively. The manganese contents of the analysed food samples were in the range of 26–345mgkg−1."

This method can solve the problems associated with the limited application of the conventional IL-based DLLME in these samples. This is believed to arise from dissolving of the ionic liquids in aqueous samples with high salt content. In this method, the robustness of microextraction system against high salt concentration (up to 40%, w/v) is increased by introducing a common ion of the ionic liquid into the sample solution. The proposed method was applied satisfactorily to the preconcentration of lead and cadmium in saline samples. After preconcentration, the settled IL-phase was dissolved in 100μL ethanol and aspirated into the flame atomic absorption spectrometer (FAAS) using a home-made microsample introduction system. Several variables affecting the microextraction efficiency were investigated and optimized. Under the optimized conditions and preconcentration of only 10mL of sample, the enhancement factors of 273 and 311 and the detection limits of 0.6μgL−1 and 0.03μgL−1 were obtained for lead and cadmium, respectively. Validation of the method was performed by both an analysis of a certified reference material (CRM) and comparison of results with those obtained by ISO standard method."

In addition to the well-known effect of phosphorus, nitrogen as a trigger of macrophyte decline has received increasing attention. The precise impact of high nitrogen concentrations is debated, and the role of different candidate factors may well change over the season. In this study, we conducted experiments with Vallisneria natans during the growing season (June–September) in 10 ponds subjected to substantial differences in nitrogen loading (five targeted total nitrogen concentrations: control, 2, 10, 20, and 100mgL−1) and compared the results with those obtained in our earlier published study from the low-growth season (December–April). Like in the low-growth season, growth of V. natans in summer declined with increasing ammonium (NH4) concentrations and particularly with increasing phytoplankton chlorophyll a (ChlaPhyt). Accordingly, we propose that shading by phytoplankton might be of key importance for macrophyte decline, affecting also periphyton growth as periphyton chlorophyll a (ChlaPeri) decreased with increasing ChlaPhyt. Free amino acid contents (FAA) of plants tended to increase with increasing NH4 concentrations, while the relationships between FAA with growth indices were all weak, suggesting that FAA might be a useful indicator of the physiological stress of the plants but not of macrophyte growth. Taken together, the results from the two seasons indicate that although a combination of high nitrogen concentrations (ammonium) and shading by phytoplankton may cause severe stress on macrophytes, active growth in the growing season enabled them to partly overcome the stress."

This work successfully developed that adding sourdough could improve the technological and nutritional properties of the bread, and that different substrates for sourdough led to differences in the bread characteristics. Breads made from sourdough exhibited lower pH (4.66–4.87) and greater acidity (3.95–4.46 mL) than the control breads. It was possible to decrease the gas production by adding sourdough, however, the gas retention ability enhanced evidently. The retention coefficients for pear and navel orange sourdoughs were 87.2% and 90.4%, respectively. Sourdough fermentation supported an appropriate acidic environment for improving the metabolic activity of some endogenous enzymes, resulting in increased specific volume and concentrations of FAAs. The 15 yeasts and 26 LAB isolates from the pear sourdough, the 21 yeasts and 18 LAB isolates from the navel orange sourdough were identified using 16S rRNA gene and 26S rRNA gene sequencing.

GC–MS analysis showed 23 volatile organic compounds, including many C5–C9 aldehydes and alcohols in the fresh fillets. The coating treatments, especially chitosan-clove bud essential oil composite coatings, sharply reduced the relative content of off-odor volatiles, such as hexanal, octanal and 1-octen-3-ol.

abstract = "This paper has two complementary focuses. The first is the system design and algorithmic development for air traffic control (ATC) using an associative SIMD processor (AP). The second is the comparison of this implementation with a multiprocessor implementation and the implications of these comparisons. This paper demonstrates how one application, ATC, can more easily, more simply, and more efficiently be implemented on an AP than is generally possible on other types of traditional hardware. The AP implementation of ATC will take advantage of its deterministic hardware to use static scheduling. The software will be dramatically smaller and cheaper to create and maintain. Likewise, a large AP system will be considerably simpler and cheaper than the MIMD hardware currently used. While APs were used for ATC-type applications earlier, these are no longer available. We use a ClearSpeed CSX600 accelerator to emulate the AP solutions of ATC on an ATC prototype consisting of eight data-intensive ATC real-time tasks. Its performance is compared with an 8-core multiprocessor (MP) using OpenMP. Our extensive experiments show that the AP implementation meets all deadlines while the MP will regularly miss a large number of deadlines. The AP code will be similar in size to sequential code for the same tasks and will avoid all of the additional support software needed with an MP to handle dynamic scheduling, load balancing, shared resource management, race conditions, false sharing, etc. At this point, essentially only MIMD systems are built. Many of the advantages of using an AP to solve an ATC problem would carry over to other applications. AP solutions for a wide variety of applications will be cited in this paper. Applications that involve a high degree of data parallelism such as database management, text processing, image processing, graph processing, bioinformatics, weather modeling, managing UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems or drones) etc., are good candidates for AP solutions. This raises the issue of whether we should routinely consider using non-multiprocessor hardware like the AP for applications where substantially simpler software solutions will normally exist. It also raises the question of whether the use of both AP and MIMD hardware in a single hetergeneous system could provide more versatility and efficiency. Either the AP or MIMD could serve as the primary system, but could hand off jobs it could not handle efficiently to the other system."

Results showed that FAA contents were significantly higher even on the 10th day after stopping of NH4+ pulse. Both species accumulated large amounts of NH4N and FAA mainly in the leaves in response to the NH4+ pulse. M. spicatum accumulated more FAA than C. demersum despite both species accumulated similar amounts of NH4N. The higher starch and SC reserves in M. spicatum benefited its higher NH4+ capture and assimilation compared to C. demersum. The C source for N assimilation came mainly from SC in the roots of M. spicatum. The species-specific strategy in CN metabolism and the long-lasting effects of NH4+ pulse on the CN metabolism would affect growth, distribution, and interaction of the plants in lakes."

With increasing water depth, P. malaianus, P. maackianus and V. natans initiated dying at 4.0m, 5.5m and 7.0m water depths, respectively. V. natans showed higher RGR than the other two species. For all the plants, the FAA contents increased with increasing water depth, except for the roots of P. maackianus. The TN contents showed a unimodal curve along water depths with the highest in moderate water depth, except for P. malaianus and the roots of V. natans. For V. natans and P. maackianus, the C metabolic indices (SC, starch, and TC) showed a unimodal curve along water depths with the lowest in moderate water depth in the leaves and stems, except for TC contents in the leaves of P. maackianus. Compared with P. maackianus and P. malaianus, lower SC and FAA contents and higher starch storage in V. natans contributed to its higher tolerance to deeper depths. The nonlinear changes in metabolite contents along water depths for V. natans and P. maackianus demonstrated complex mechanism for low light adaptation, and thus partly explained the wider ranges of colonizing water depths than P. malaianus."

Changes were identified by measuring the biomass of the sampled macrophytes and metabolite contents of soluble carbohydrate (SC), starch, and free amino acid (FAA) in their organs. Results showed that no significant and consistent changes were found in the SC and FAA contents in leaves and stems from 1.0m to 5.5m water depth, as compared to previous results of controlled studies, suggesting a relative stable C/N metabolism in response to the depth gradients in studied natural populations of P. maackianus. The metabolite contents with the most variations appeared mainly because of seasonal changes. The metabolite contents of the macrophyte populations were more closely correlated with the chemical parameters than with the light parameters in water columns. No significant correlations were found between the metabolite contents with the light attenuation coefficient ($K$) and Secchi depth (SD) in water columns. The NO3–N and total phosphorus (TP) contents in water columns were positively correlated with the SC and starch contents in leaves, respectively. The NH4–N content in water columns was negatively related to the FAA content in leaves. Metabolite contents had weak correlations with depth gradients and light parameters, probably because of the physiological integration among individuals by developed stolons and the canopy-forming characteristic of this species. Our results highlighted the importance of water quality to the C/N metabolism in natural population of submersed macrophyte."

This task allowed for the comparison of nonlinear moduli results to the current FAA methodology used in FAA AC-150-5320-6E (FAA, 2009). This publication discusses and presents the moduli results obtained from a comprehensive multi-layer stress analysis of the CC-7 pavement section, for a wide range of load cart configurations, wheel loads and contact areas. While the overall average results of 243 separate pavement computer analysis were found to provide somewhat comparable modulus values, several analytical limitations were found that would lead to relative errors of resilient modulus of base and subbase materials ranging from −60% to +60%. Errors in the modulus of the underlying base and subbase layers are very important as they will lead to significant errors in predicting the subsequent fatigue cracking resistance and predictions of any asphalt surfacing layer."

The extraction organic phase was injected into FAAS for the determination of Cr(VI). Total Cr concentration was determined after oxidizing Cr(III) to Cr(VI) in the presence of KMnO4 and using the extraction procedure mentioned above. Cr(III) was calculated by subtracting of Cr(VI) from the total Cr. Under optimized conditions, a detection limit of 0.7ngmL−1 and an enrichment factor of 175 were achieved. The relative standard deviation (RSD) was 4.9% for Cr(VI) (40ngmL−1, n=5). The proposed method was successfully applied to the speciation of chromium in natural water samples with satisfactory results."

After 42 days fermentation at 24 °C, Suan yu inoculated with different mixed starter cultures underwent rapid growth of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), declined pH, suppressed increase of thiobarbituric acid (TBARS) and total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N) as well as growth of spoilage bacteria and pathogens. Besides, Suan yu had higher contents of non-protein nitrogen (NPN) and total free amino acids (FAA) compared to the control (P < 0.05). The muscle proteins were severely hydrolyzed during fermentation (SDS-PAGE). Moreover, the sensory evaluation indicates the fermented fish was more widely accepted than the control. The results suggest that the inoculation with S1, S2 and S3 reduced the lag time that fermentation began and improved the quality of Suan yu."

Although toxicity of cadmium is mainly linked to cancer, the mechanism of its carcinogenic activity remains poorly understood. Since DNA methylation is linked to cancer, we have examined the effect of cadmium on DNA methylation and DNMTs mRNA expression in hen liver and kidney. Sixty 50-day-old hyline-white hens were randomly allocated into 3 equal groups; a control group fed a basal diet, a low-dose group fed the basal diet spiked with 140mg/kg CdCl2, and a high-dose group fed the basal diet spiked with 210mg/kg CdCl2. After 60 days, liver and kidney samples were analysed for cadmium by FAAS, DNA methylation level by HPLC and DNMTs mRNA levels by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The DNA methylation levels and the expressions of DNMT1 and DNMT3a mRNA in liver and kidney were significantly elevated by the cadmium treatment but there was no change in the expression of DNMT3b mRNA in the two tissues. The fact that cadmium increases DNA methylation and the expressions of DNMT1 and DNMT3a mRNA in liver and kidney suggests DNA methylation may be involved in the carcinogenic action of cadmium."

Many studies have examined the effects of low light and high nutrient alone on the decline of submersed macrophytes. Some studies have also examined the combined effects of low light and high nutrient on seagrass, but very few on freshwater macrophytes. In the present study, a factorial design of three sunlight intensities (100%, 42% and 11% full sunlight) with two nutrient levels in water (mesotrophic water and eutrophic water) was used to examine the combined effects of low light and high nutrient stresses of the water column on submersed macrophyte. Specifically, we examined the changes by testing the changes of the carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolisms, and response of antioxidant enzymes in a submersed macrophytes Potamogeton crispus. The results showed that plants tended to reduce tissue soluble protein, soluble carbohydrates (SC) contents, and SC/FAA ratios both in nutrient-enriched waters and shaded conditions, while plants accumulated free amino acids (FAA), promoted superoxide dismutase (SOD) and guaiacol peroxidase (POD) activities under these conditions. The potential mechanisms may involve the following aspects: (1) FAA was formed to transfer the accumulated NH4+–N in the plant; (2) Carbohydrates and protein contents of the plants decreased due to the decline of photosynthesis in shaded condition; (3) Carbohydrates were also consumed significantly due to their transformation into the carbon skeleton of FAA; (4) Antioxidant enzymes SOD and POD were found to closely collaborate with each other in responding to low light and high nutrient stresses. The present study indicated that low light and high nutrient in water column could aggravate the carbon consumption and nitrogen accumulation metabolisms, and caused oxidative stress in the submersed plant. These findings contributed to the mechanisms for submersed macrophytes’ decline in eutrophic lakes."

Moreover, taking the cadmium ion as an example, the thermodynamics and kinetics of the adsorption were studied. The results show that the microspheres were porous and were made of perovskite nano-calcium titanate. The lead, cadmium and zinc ions studied could be quantitatively retained at a pH value range of 5–8. The adsorption capacities of PCTOM for lead, cadmium and zinc were found to be 141.8mgg−1, 18.0mgg−1 and 24.4mgg−1 respectively. The adsorption behavior followed a Langmuir adsorption isotherm and a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, where adsorption was an endothermic and spontaneous physical process. The adsorbed metal ions could be completely eluated using 2molL−1 HNO3 with preconcentration factors over 100 for all studied heavy metal ions. The method has also been applied to the preconcentration and FAAS determination of trace lead, cadmium and zinc ion in water samples with satisfactory results."

To describe original samples’ surface physical and chemical characteristics, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (FAAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope and Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (SEM-EDS) and TG-DTA were used. Then, used XRD and SEM-EDS to describe the system features and characterization of the anode slime performed by Washing-Roasting. Through application of XRF and FAAS, element content in anode slime and the source of each element were analyzed. The results show that the original samples of anode slime mainly contains Mn, Pb, Ca, Se and Sr and averagely the contents of manganese and lead are 47% and 7.46%, respectively. XRD analysis shows that main phases of the anode slime are KxMn8O16,MnO2,PbMn8O16 and Pb2Mn8O16, and MnO2 in the slime has a mixed crystal structure of α-MnO2,β-MnO2,γ-MnO2,δ-MnO2. SEM-EDS analysis indicates that the anode slime has dense “mineral” phase. TG-DTA/DTG analysis shows that at the temperature of 0 ∼ 573 ̊C, water in δ-MnO2 lattice is desorbed; 573 ∼ 655 ̊C, MnO2 starts to lose oxygen and turn into Mn2O3; 900 ∼ 1000 ̊C Mn2O3 loses oxygen and turn into Mn3O4. Anode slime under different roasting temperature were characterized by XRD and SEM-EDS. The result shows that when roasting temperature reaches higher than 700 ̊C, bond energy of Pb-O is broken; when higher than 800 ̊C, the crystallinity of anode slime further increases and the dense structure of anode slime is broken, which provides an effective way to remove lead from the slime; when higher than 900 ̊C, Mn2O3 turns into Mn3O4 and the channels in the anode slime become much looser and wider for better leaching of impurity ions."

Thus for the first time, at least for small values of n, the upper bound on nonlinearity can be reached in a deterministic manner in difference to some heuristic search methods proposed previously. The nonlinearity of these functions is extremely close to the maximum nonlinearity attained by bent functions and it might be the case that this is the highest possible nonlinearity of 1-resilient functions. Apart from this theoretical contribution, it turns out that the cryptographic properties of these functions are overall good apart from their moderate resistance to fast algebraic attacks (FAA). This weakness is repaired by a suitable modification of the original functions giving a class of balanced functions with almost optimal resistance to FAA whose nonlinearity is better than the nonlinearity of other methods."

However, the effects of acetate concentration and acidic pH on methanogenesis remain unclear. Besides, although hydrogenotrophic methanogens can be suitable targets in MCF, they are generally ignored. Therefore, we intentionally enriched hydrogenotrophic methanogens and found that free acetic acid (FAA, x) concentration and specific methanogenic activity (SMA, y) were correlated according to the equation: y = 0.86 × 0.31/(0.31 + x) (R2 = 0.909). The SMA was decreased by 50% and 90% at the FAA concentrations of 0.31 and 2.36 g/L, respectively. The coenzyme M concentration and relative electron transport activity agreed well with the FAA concentration. Moreover, the methanogenic activity could not be recovered when the FAA concentration exceeded 0.81 g/L. These findings indicated that neither acetate nor acidic pH, but FAA was the key factor to inhibit methanogenesis in MCF."

Langmuir, Freundlich, and Tempkin models are applied to analyze the experimental data, and the best interpretation for the experimental data is given by the Freundlich isotherm equation. Thermodynamic parameters, the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°), enthalpy change (ΔH°), and entropy change (ΔS°), are calculated and show that adsorption of heavy metals on PEK-L is spontaneous and endothermic in nature.

FAA in grains increased at first 14 days after anthesis and then decreased to a nearly constant level. PAA in leaves showed a diminishing trend as leaf senesced after anthesis. Conversely, PAA in grain exhibited an increasing trend with the progress of grain filling. N had significantly positive effect on contents of FAA and PAA in leaves and grains. There was no obvious trend of the variation of FAA in leaves and grains with N rates. PAA in leaves was more sensitive to N fertilization. By contrast, PAA in grains was more stable across N rates, especially at the late stage of grain filling. In addition, composition of leaf PAA was different from that of grain, indicating the reconstruction of amino acids during the process of translocation of N compounds from leaves to grains."

abstract = "Coal mine methane (CMM) drainage via adopting in-seam horizontal boreholes is an effective way to decrease ventilation cost and production delay, ensure mining safety, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the supply of energy resource. Ventilation air leakage into borehole, however, occurs frequently, which decreases the methane-drainage efficiency. Despite extensive anti-leakage method investigations, a very few studies have been focused on spraying air-proof materials on the roadway rib and optimizing borehole sealing along the borehole, along with taking the effects of sequential excavations of roadway and borehole into account. In this paper, based on data of a real coal mine, a fully coupled mathematical model was developed by incorporating coal permeability with coal mechanical properties and gas adsorption/desorption and was then implemented into a Finite Element software. This numerical simulation was used to analyse transient stress and dynamic air-leakage flow fields around the drainage borehole. Simulation results indicate that: (1) four stress areas (І to IV) exist around the roadway based on different relief status of the tri-axial stress, and stress distributions around the borehole in those four areas are different from each other; (2) based on different air-leakage degrees, on the roadway rib, there are four air-leakage levels around borehole. Meanwhile, there are four leakage areas along the borehole: FAA, SAA, HAA and VAA, and the optimal sealing length should be over 17m (exceeding HAA) to prevent air leakage. Air-leakage results in (2) are verified mutually with the mechanics outcomes in (1). Meanwhile, real data obtained from field experiments is introduced to validate the simulation results. All those outcomes can allow for the optimal design of the spraying area and order and borehole sealing, thus provide scientific basis for an integrated anti-air-leakage method including spraying air-proof materials on the roadway wall and sealing borehole effectively, to prevent ventilation air leakage and maximize methane drainage performance."

abstract = "Transverse grooves have been widely used on airport runways to improve their drainage capacity and skid resistance. Therefore, regular measurement and evaluation of groove dimensions on airport runways are significant for runways to improve skid resistance and eliminate hydroplaning risks. However, there are few effective methods that are able to automatically and accurately measure groove dimension. This study introduces a new method for automated groove identification and measurement using Long Short-term Memory (LSTM). The GrooveNet is designed to identify the potential dip and determine two endpoints of the identified dip. Subsequently, dip dimension is calculated according to FAA AC No. 150/5320-12C. Finally, the modified Naïve Bayes classifier is proposed to distinguish grooves and slab joints. Results indicate that the proposed methodology (including GrooveNet and modified Naïve Bayes classifier) is more robust and accurate in runway groove identification and measurement. With the proposed approach, operators of airfield runway pavements have a robust tool to conduct groove safety evaluation and further provide corrective maintenance actions for the unsafe runway grooves."

abstract = "Variation of 19 free amino acids (FAA) in serum and hepatopancreas, glucose in serum and glycogen in hepatopancreas were investigated in white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei (IBW 5.0±0.3g) when water temperature dropped from 28 to 13°C within 4days, in order to provide basic data for biochemical changes of the species during cold stress. The results showed that, concentrations of 14 FAA in serum decreased directly with decreasing temperature, with a magnitude of between 12.15% and 400.89%. Concentrations of 5 FAA in hepatopancreas increased directly with decreasing temperature, while that of 8 FAA, remained unchanged or declined at the last stage of the cold stress when water temperature decreased from 18°C to 13°C. Exceptionally, concentration of taurine in hepatopancreas continually decreased during the entire procedure. Serum glucose content gradually increased with decreasing temperature, while hepatopancreas glycogen content just sharply declined at the early stage of the cold stress (28 to 23°C) but slightly changed then (23 to 13°C). We conclude that quick utilization of glycogen as a temporary energy source occurs in L. vannamei during the early stage of cold stress. Variation of FAA in serum and hepatopancreas reflects a balance of protein degradation and synthesis under the combined stress of cold stress and starvation, and also gives information that FAA may play important roles such as functional substrates or energy utilization for the animal to sustain prolonged and intensified cold stress. So, dietary protein quality and quantity during cold stress should be paid more attention during feed formulation."

abstract = "Scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) and abalone (Haliotis discus hannai Ino) muscle were hydrolysed with commercially available food-grade proteases. The resulting hydrolysates showed DPPH and hydroxyl radicals scavenging abilities, reducing power, and ferrous ion chelating capacity. The antioxidant activities of hydrolysate of abalone foot muscle (HAFM) increased with increasing incubation time during the whole hydrolysis process in 180min. Whereas, the antioxidant activities of hydrolysate of scallop adductor muscle (HSAM) increased at initial stage and peaked after 25–30min of hydrolysis, and then gradually decreased thereafter. Compared with HAFM, HSAM with comparable hydrolysis time contained more free amino acids (FAA) and small-sized peptides (below 500Da), which may account for the differences in antioxidant activities versus hydrolysis time curves of the two hydrolysates. The above results indicate that limited hydrolysis of proteins can increase their antioxidant activity, whereas extensive hydrolysis can decrease it."

To study the solid solutions of Ca4[Al(OH)6]2CrO4·nH2O (CrO4-AFm) and the composition of coexisting aqueous phase, AFm phases containing Cl− and CrO2- 4 were synthesized and characterized with XRD, SEM, FTIR, FAAS and Ion chromatography (IC). Based on the determined total solubility of products and ion concentrations in solution, a solid solution-aqueous solution (SSAS) model for binary mixing of Cl-AFm and CrO4-AFm phases was established to predict aqueous solubility of Ca4[Al(OH)6]2[(CrO4)x(Cl)2-2x]•nH2O as a function of total Cl/Cr ratio in solid solution system. The solubility constant (pK) of pure Cl-AFm is 27.09 and its free energy of formation (ΔGo f) is −7047.80 kJ mol−1 at 27 °C. pK of pure CrO4-AFm is 29.07 and its ΔGo f is −8238.66 kJ mol−1 at 27 °C. Both the experimental and modeled data showed that the formation of solid solutions between Cl-AFm and CrO4-AFm could greatly lower the chromate concentration in aqueous solution. Therefore, this study suggested that (Cl, CrO4)-AFm compounds could efficiently immobilize the trace metal CrO42- in cement-stabilized wastes."

The application of optimization procedure conditions of chromatographic separation of inorganic forms of aluminium was achieved by the analytical column IonPac CS5A (Dionex) with guard column IonPac CG5A (Dionex) and an aqueous ammonium chloride mobile phase, at pH about 3 with gradient elution. The separation of Al forms with nominal charge of 1+, 2+, 3+ required a run time of less than 8min during a single analysis. The proposed method has been successfully used for the examination of aluminium forms formation AlFn(3−n)+ in environmental samples."

Three types of AEMs were examined, including Poly(hexamethyl-p-terphenyl benzimidazolium) (HMT-PMBI), Fumatech® FAA-3, and poly(phenylene oxide) functionalized with imidazole (PPO-Im). The effect of temperature and humidity on AEM properties in their different anion forms was studied, including both steady state and dynamic measurements. In addition, the response to changes in CO2 concentration and to application of ex-situ electric current was examined. Results showed that an increase in humidity leads to an increase in water content and an increase in conductivity of the AEMs, regardless the anion type. It was found that both temperature and relative humidity improve conductivity in carbonated forms, however relative humidity has the most significant impact. The carbonation process in 400 ppm CO2 is slightly quicker in AEMs with low conductivity, lasting ca. 40 min; however it was shown that a reverse process can be achieved by applying an electric current through the AEMs. An increase by 2–10 fold in conductivity is obtained using this method, which is analogous to the changes observed during operation of the fuel cell. This work provides important data that needs to be taken into account in future work in order to ultimately mitigate the carbonation effects and improve the performance of AEM fuel cells running with ambient air."

A two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) modeling approach is employed for this purpose. In the first stage, we estimate airport productive efficiency using a variable returns-to-scale DEA model with both desirable and undesirable outputs. In the second stage, random effects regression models are estimated with airport efficiency scores from the first stage as the dependent variable and PFC and a proxy for AIP grants as two of the explanatory variables. By applying the two-stage DEA model to 42 primary US airports, it is found that PFC use has a positive impact on airport productive efficiency, whereas the impact of AIP grants is negative. Multiple counterfactual scenarios are examined by altering the mix of the two types of funding sources. The results show that simultaneously raising the PFC ceiling and decreasing AIP grants could lead to greater airport productive efficiency. The US federal aviation authority would also benefit from realizing these scenarios, especially given the budgetary constraints it faces."

Ultrasound power with 0 W, 400 W, 600 W, 800 W and 1000 W (frequency of 20 kHz) were used for cooking 120 min. The sodium chloride, sugar, free amino acids (FAAs), 5′-ribonucleotides, lipid oxidation, volatile flavor substance contents and electronic nose of spiced beef were determined. Results showed that ultrasonic treatment could significantly increase the content of sodium chloride in beef sample (P < 0.05). When the ultrasonic power lower than 1000 W, the content of sugar and 5′-ribonucleotides could be increased significantly compared with the control (P < 0.05). The essential amino acid content and the essential amino acid/non-essential ratios (E/NE) were significantly increased with the ultrasound treatment (P < 0.05). The lipid oxidation showed that ultrasound resulted in the increased of TBARS values compared with control significantly (P < 0.05), but no significant differences were shown among the different ultrasonic power groups (P > 0.05). With the ultrasonic treatment, the types and relative content of volatile flavor substances were significantly increased (P < 0.05), especially for aldehydes, alcohols and ketones. However, there was no significant variation among the different ultrasound power groups (P > 0.05). This result was consistent with the measurement of electronic nose. Data points of control samples were away from ultrasonic treatment groups, while data points of different ultrasonic treatment groups were flock together. The results indicate that the application of ultrasound during cooking has a positive effect on chemical profiles of spiced beef taste and flavor, particularly for the power of 800 W."
