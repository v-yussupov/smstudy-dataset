abstract={Serverless distributed computing has received significant attention from both the industry and the research community. Among the most popular applications are the wide area network file systems, exemplified by CFS, Farsite and OceanStore. These file systems store files on a large collection of untrusted nodes that form an overlay network. They use cryptographic techniques to maintain file confidentiality and integrity from malicious nodes. Unfortunately, cryptographic techniques cannot protect a file holder from a Denial-of-Service (DoS) or a host compromise attack. Hence, most of these distributed file systems are vulnerable to targeted file attacks, wherein an adversary attempts to attack a small (chosen) set of files by attacking the nodes that host them. This paper presents LocationGuard - a location hiding technique for securing overlay file storage systems from targeted file attacks. LocationGuard has three essential components: (i) location key, (ii) routing guard, a secure algorithm that protects accesses to a file in the overlay network given its location key, and (iii) a set of location inference guards. Our experimental results quantify the overhead of employing LocationGuard and demonstrate its effectiveness against DoS attacks, host compromise attacks and various location inference attacks.},

abstract={The robust control of a linear ultrasonic motor based X-Y-thetas motion control stage to track various contours is achieved by using an adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy neural network (AIT2FNN) control system in this study. In the proposed AIT2FNN control system, an IT2FNN, which combines the merits of an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system and a neural network, is developed to approximate an unknown dynamic function. Moreover, adaptive learning algorithms are derived using the Lyapunov stability theorem to train the parameters of the IT2FNN online. Furthermore, a robust compensator is proposed to confront the uncertainties including the approximation error, optimal parameter vectors, and higher order terms in Taylor series. To relax the requirement for the value of lumped uncertainty in the robust compensator, an adaptive lumped uncertainty estimation law is also investigated. In addition, the circle and butterfly contours are planned using a nonuniform rational B-spline curve interpolator. The experimental results show that the contour tracking performance of the proposed AIT2FNN is significantly improved compared with the adaptive type-1 FNN. Additionally, the robustness to parameter variations, external disturbances, cross-coupled interference, and frictional force can also be obtained using the proposed AIT2FNN.},

abstract={A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based computed force control system using an Elman neural network (ENN) is proposed to control the mover position of a linear ultrasonic motor (LUSM) in this paper. First, the structure and operating principle of the LUSM are introduced. Then, the dynamics of the LUSM mechanism with the introduction of a lumped uncertainty, which include the friction force, are derived. Since the dynamic characteristics and motor parameters of the LUSM are nonlinear and time varying, a computed force control system using ENN is designed to improve the control performance for the tracking of various reference trajectories. The ENN with both online learning and excellent approximation capabilities is employed to estimate a nonlinear function including the lumped uncertainty of the moving table mechanism. Moreover, the Lyapunov stability theorem and the projection algorithm are adopted to ensure the stability of the control system and the convergence of the ENN. Furthermore, an FPGA chip is adopted to implement the developed control algorithm for possible low-cost and high-performance industrial applications. The experimental results show that excellent positioning and tracking performance are achieved, and the robustness to parameter variations and friction force can be obtained as well using the proposed control system.},

First, an indirect field-oriented mechanism is implemented for the control of the IG. Then, an AC/DC power converter and a DC/AC power inverter are developed to convert the electric power generated by a three-phase IG from variable frequency and variable voltage to constant frequency and constant voltage, respectively. Moreover, two online-trained recurrent FL-based FNNs are introduced as the regulating controllers for both the DC-link voltage of the AC/DC power converter and the AC line voltage of the DC/AC power inverter. Furthermore, IPSO is adopted to adjust the learning rates to improve the online learning capability of the recurrent FL-based FNNs. Finally, some experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed recurrent FL-based FNN-controlled IG system.},

abstract={Broad area maritime surveillance (BAMS) is a current interest area for the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Robust communications is a primary concern that impedes the general acceptance of UAVs by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as loss of communications link is generally perceived as a loss of vehicular control. Thus, to gain an increased understanding of the communications channel UAVs' experience during low-level maritime operations, a channel-modeling effort using the finite-difference time domain method (FDTD) is conducted. The focus of this effort has been to assess the effects of sea surface shadowing conditions on the marine communications channel. A 2-D electromagnetic (EM) simulator has been developed, utilizing modified Pierson-Moskowitz (PM) spectral models to generate a random sea surface in a deep-water location from which multipath scattering is produced. Data analysis conducted on the transient EM simulation results has produced generalized path loss exponent, standard deviation, mean excess delay, and root mean square delay models as a function of frequency and observable sea surface height for fixed transmitter and receiver locations.},

abstract={This addresses topics concerning the development of future Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) so they can operate safely within the community of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Studies by the Defense Science Board, the Office of Science and Technology, Government Accountability Office, and the Congressional Research Service Library of Congress have all emphasized that soon there will be a significant number of UAVs operating side-by-side with manned civil aircraft in the FAA's National Airspace System (NAS). It is anticipated that future UAVs will perform many of the dull, dirty, and dangerous civilian missions. In 2006, about 600 UAVs were manufactured in the US alone. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developers of UAVs to understand safety certification for operations in the NAS, and that safety certification starts with safety requirements, safety design, safe development processes, safety verification, and safe operating procedures in the planned operational environment.},

Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are serverless self-organized infrastructures that enable end-to-end communications. The P2P churn and the instabilities of MANETs interconnections bring important challenges to P2P over MANETs(PoM). A consumer peer in PoM wastes several of its scarce resources managing the communication with the peer that provides content. Our proposal aims at reducing the consumer peer control over the communication so that to avoid unnecessary consumption of its resources.

abstract={The problem of "sense-and-avoid" for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) is genuinely multi-dimensional: there is a wide range of UAS sizes, speeds, and maneuverability, as well as missions for which these UAS will be used. There are also a variety of sensors that might be used for sense-and-avoid, which have widely varying capabilities to measure distance or angle to an obstacle, as well as closing rate, and time to collision. Most sensors are not able to provide all required information about the geometry of an encounter; therefore, using a combination of sensors offers one possible solution. We are investigating the concept that there may be a variety of possible sensor solutions for each distinct UAS capability or mission. By studying the breadth of UAS types and missions, and selectively testing certain sensors in the field, we are evaluating the limits to the capabilities of sensors and sensor combinations. This report is on the progress of this multi-dimensional evaluation. We have scoped the dimensions for evaluating UAS capabilities and the capabilities of sensors. We are experimentally evaluating sensor parameters on a variety of aircraft to validate the specified capabilities. This reports on our methodology for field evaluation of sensor technology and the lessons learned on evaluation platforms and capabilities.},

In this paper, a method of estimating channel performance with hidden transmitters is derived on a radio by radio basis. This method proves to be faster than the VDL Mode 2 simulations, allowing scenarios to be evaluated quickly. The process is applied to a large dynamic data set that demonstrates the usefulness of this approach.},

In this initiative, the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) is responsible for managing a public/private partnership to bring NextGen online by 2025.11 The goal of NextGen is to significantly increase the safety, security, capacity, efficiency, and environmental compatibility of air transportation operations, and by doing so, to improve the overall economic well-being of the country. These benefits can be achieved through a combination of new procedures and advances in the technology deployed to manage passenger, air cargo, and air traffic operations. The JPDO is the central organization that coordinates the specialized efforts of the Departments of Transportation, Defense, Homeland Security, Commerce, FAA, NASA, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. NextGen is a complex system of systems that requires significant research, development and implementation of multiple technologies, change of human roles, processes and policies. To achieve the 2025 vision and realize the benefits of NextGen, the systems and processes of today must be rigorously and systematically transformed through the sustained, coordinated and integrated efforts of many stakeholders. Within the JPDO two divisions worked together to develop an initial analysis framework that evaluated key strategic decision and policy challenges associated with the Operational Improvements in the NextGen Enterprise Architecture. These divisions: the Systems Modeling and Analysis Division (SMAD) and the Policy Division (PD) then used the analysis framework to build a policy/decision model to plug into the SMAD National Air Space Simulation Environment in order to assess the potentially strategic organizational risks associated with the NextGen implementation plan. This paper documents how the JPDO High Density Case Study developed the policy/decision model, the significant implications of the current organizational risks and plans for future model and analysis development to address those risks.},

abstract={In this paper, a robust dynamic sliding mode control system (RDSMC) using a recurrent Elman neural network (RENN) is proposed to control the position of a levitated object of a magnetic levitation system considering the uncertainties. First, a dynamic model of the magnetic levitation system is derived. Then, a proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-type sliding-mode control system (SMC) is adopted for tracking of the reference trajectories. Moreover, a new PID-type dynamic sliding-mode control system (DSMC) is proposed to reduce the chattering phenomenon. However, due to the hardware being limited and the uncertainty bound being unknown of the switching function for the DSMC, an RDSMC is proposed to improve the control performance and further increase the robustness of the magnetic levitation system. In the RDSMC, an RENN estimator is used to estimate an unknown nonlinear function of lumped uncertainty online and replace the switching function in the hitting control of the DSMC directly. The adaptive learning algorithms that trained the parameters of the RENN online are derived using Lyapunov stability theorem. Furthermore, a robust compensator is proposed to confront the uncertainties including approximation error, optimal parameter vectors, and higher order terms in Taylor series. Finally, some experimental results of tracking the various periodic trajectories demonstrate the validity of the proposed RDSMC for practical applications.},

abstract={We propose a symbol-based belief propagation (BP) algorithm for iterative soft-decision decoding of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. Complexity reduction is achieved by using a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based BP algorithm. Parity-check matrix adaptation based on the reliability of the codeword symbols is an essential step to make the BP algorithm effective on high-density parity-check matrices characteristic of RS codes. The matrix adaptation, as well as all other operations, is performed at symbol level such that bit-to-symbol and symbol-to- bit conversions are avoided. A moderate coding gain over algebraic hard-decision decoding is achieved on additive white Gaussian noise channels. The symbol-based algorithm presented in this paper addresses the main weakness of its bit-based counterpart, namely the prohibitively high complexity for practical applications that use long codes and large finite fields, albeit with less coding gain.},

pages={4868-4877},
abstract={Preventing interference among mobile radio (MR) nets often requires spectrum managers to observe channel-assignment rules based on minimum ratios of the great-circle distances traversed by desired and undesired (potentially interfering) signals. Finding the true minimum values of these ratios, rather than the simply computed worst-case estimates, is necessary to utilize the spectrum efficiently. This paper provides an analysis of the case where the MRs operate in or above circular service areas on the surface of a spherical Earth. The analysis provides an accurate and efficient way, which is less complicated than performing the calculations on the sphere, to compute true minimum distance ratios. The method uses stereographic projection to transform the original minimization problem into a simpler problem of minimizing a ratio of Euclidean distances, which is expressed as a function of a single real variable, over the boundaries of discs (i.e., circles) in the complex plane. In a large, complicated problem, this methodology has been shown to reduce the computational time by two thirds.},

abstract={Triethylenetetramine(TETA) was reacted with carbon bisulfide in an alkaline medium in order to prepare a bisdithiocarbamate chelator, namely sodion triethylenetetramine- bisdithiocarbamate(DTC-TETA). The chelator was characterized and examined by FTIR, UV spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Its complexes with heavy metal ions were also checked by UV spectroscopy. Comparison of heavy metal ions' stability for DTC- TETA with that for sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) was accomplished using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) coupled with flow-injection. By introducing NCS groups onto the TETA terminals, the FTIR spectrum shows strong absorption peaks at 1461~1388 cm-1 and 1174 ~ 996 cm-1 which were attributed to partly double bonds of C- ....N and C- ....S, respectively, representing the formation of DTC-TETA. The UV spectrum of DTC-TETA has two absorption peaks at 265 nm and 290 nm, assigned to pi-pi* transition of NhellipChellipS radical and nonbonding electron n-pi* transition of ShellipChellipS radical to conjugated system, respectively. The elemental analysis results demonstrate that the mol ratio of C, H, N and S in DTC-TETA was about 2:4:1:1. As for UV spectra of its Complexes with Cu (II) , Cd (II) , Zn (II) and Ni (II) , there are new four absorption peaks at 321 nm, 310 nm, 311 nm and 325 nm, respectively, confirming the formation of metal complexes. Coupled with flow- injection, FAAS determination shows that the complexation properties ofCu2+, Cd2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+ complexes of DTC-TETA are all better than those of DDTC at the same concentration.},

abstract={High resolution imaging radars have come a long way since the early 90's, starting with an FAA Synthetic Vision System program at 35/94 GHz. These systems were heavy and bulky, carried a price tag of about $500K, and were only suitable for larger aircrafts at very small quantity production. Size, weight, and power constraints make 94 GHz still a preferred choice for many situational awareness applications ranging from landing in poor visibility due to fog or brown-out, to cable warning & obstacle avoidance and sense and avoid for unmanned aerial systems. Using COTS components and highly integrated MMIC modules, a complete radar breadboard has been demonstrated in 9 months in one line replacement unit with a total weight of 20 lbs. The new generation of this 94 GHz FMCW imaging sensor will be on the order of 15 lbs or less including the entire radar signal processor. The size and weight achievements of this sensor open up the potential market for rotorcrafts and general aviation.},

abstract={This paper describes an ADS-B based collision avoidance radar that allows small autonomous UAVs to detect cooperative and non-cooperative targets in air space co-located with manned air. The targeted host platforms are small UAVs with 3.3 m or shorter wing spans. This radar system is effective against all air traffic, with or without transponder-based collision avoidance systems such as TCAS or ADS-B. It is even effective for stationary structures such as high-rise buildings and towers. It is based on the standard ADS-B signal, so no additional spectrum is needed. This system can leverage many commercial off-the-shelf components in existing transponders. Furthermore, it does not require modifications to the existing air traffic control system in the Continental United States or worldwide. Therefore, it should be easier to get the FAA's approval. The development and manufacturing costs are relatively inexpensive.},

abstract={A recurrent functional link (FL)-based fuzzy neural network (FNN) controller is proposed in this study to control the mover of a permanent-magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) servo drive to track periodic reference trajectories. First, the dynamic model of the PMLSM drive system is derived. Next, a recurrent FL-based FNN controller is proposed in this study to control the PMLSM. Moreover, the online learning algorithms of the connective weights, means, and standard deviations of the recurrent FL-based FNN are derived using the back-propagation (BP) method. However, divergence or degenerated responses will result from the inappropriate selection of large or small learning rates. Therefore, an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) is adopted to adapt the learning rates of the recurrent FL-based FNN online. Finally, the control performance of the proposed recurrent FL-based FNN controller with IPSO is verified by some simulated and experimental results.},

title={Increasing airport arrival capacity in NextGen with wake turbulence avoidance},
year={2009},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-15},
abstract={Arrival capacity at major airports is a primary constraint that must be overcome to reach the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) capacity goals. At the nation's busiest airports with closely spaced parallel runways for arrivals, capacity can be reduced significantly when weather at these airports falls below visual approach minima. When visual approaches can be used for arriving aircraft, pilots can apply their experience and judgment to position their aircraft to avoid wake turbulence generated by other aircraft they are following to the airport. This practice allows for the best arrival capacity to be achieved in good weather. When ceiling and visibility fall below that required for visual approaches, airports that would normally arrive on two parallel runways spaced less than 2500 feet (ft) apart, must discontinue parallel approaches, thus reducing the arrival rate to what can be achieved with a single runway. This reduction in capacity is due to the air traffic control (ATC) requirement that parallel runways spaced this closely must be treated as one runway for application of wake turbulence separation. A new wake turbulence procedure has recently been approved for use at several airports that allows arrivals at these airports to reduce separation between aircraft on parallel approaches in weather below visual approach minima using a parallel dependent stagger arrival operation. This procedure, documented in JO 7110.308, allows aircraft to arrive in staggered pairs, with Large and Small wake category aircraft in the lead. With this procedure, approximately half of the capacity normally lost due to deteriorating weather can be regained. Additional procedures are being explored, such as Wake Turbulence Mitigation for Arrivals (WTMA) that will allow additional gains in capacity by including additional airports with more closely spaced runways, and additional wake category aircraft participating as leaders in this parallel dependent stagger approach procedure. The MITRE Corporation's Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD) has been supporting the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Wake Turbulence Office to evaluate the feasibility and capacity benefit of these improvements. This paper provides an overview of the WTMA concept and describes analysis techniques used to develop initial estimates of the capacity improvement that various phases of WTMA will provide.},

title={Balancing Air Traffic Control workload across dual area navigation arrival procedures},
year={2009},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-11},
abstract={Area navigation (RNAV) is a key component for improving the efficiency and capacity of the National Airspace System (NAS). As such, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been implementing RNAV standard instrument departures (SIDs) and standard terminal arrival routes (STARs) at airports throughout the NAS. An increasingly more common aspect of the implementation process involves a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) simulation of new procedure designs in the pre-implementation phase to evaluate traffic management difficulty, given the proposed changes, and to validate operational assumptions. The terminal area route generation evaluation and Traffic Simulation (TARGETS) tool, developed by the MITRE Corporation's Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD), provides a testing platform to simulate traffic in both en route and terminal airspace in an integrated operations setting to achieve an accurate representation of site-specific air traffic environments. This paper describes the simulation results of a large airport environment where dual RNAV STAR procedure designs were evaluated by conducting a HITL simulation using the TARGETS tool with certified professional controller (CPC) participants. The dual RNAV STARs are created as parallel arrival routings, designed with sufficient separation between them to allow for independent operations, and are used to manage high arrival demand or mixed aircraft performance over a given corner-post. During this simulation, aircraft on these STARs needed to be efficiently merged within terminal airspace, where space for vectoring was limited, in order to feed a single runway. The focus of the simulation was to assess how different traffic delivery strategies, referred to as the dasiaoperational usepsila of the RNAV STARs, could be used to move traffic from en route to terminal radar approach control (TRACON) airspace and the associated impacts on Air Traffic Control (ATC) workload. Other data included track data and participant feedback captured in a focus group-like discussion conducted at the conclusion of each scenario. Results show that when traffic was equally distributed across the parallel RNAV procedures, workload increased for TRACON controllers. In contrast, when traffic was primarily delivered using a single RNAV procedure, workload increased for the Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) controllers. A solution that provided more of a workload balance was achieved by allowing ARTCC controllers to offload aircraft on the first RNAV procedure (primary flow) to the second RNAV procedure (secondary flow), on an as-needed basis. The results of this effort reflect the effectiveness of HITL simulation in the pre-implementation phase for identifying tailored air traffic management solutions that can help increase the likelihood of successful RNAV procedure implementation so that benefits can be enabled.},

pages={1-10},
abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has defined several operational improvements, based upon emerging technologies and aircraft equipage, which largely comprise air traffic operations expected at the end of the mid-term time frame, 2018. These operational improvements are intended to not only enable user and system-wide benefits, but also serve as the foundation for transforming the National Airspace System (NAS) into the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). To plan for and better understand operational improvement implementation issues, the MITRE Corporation's Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD) has been formulating scenarios, derived from identified sets of related operational improvements, that provide a snapshot of future operations and detail key aspects. Development of the scenarios was largely based on the utilization of a visually motivated technique referred to as dasiastoryboardingpsila. The nature of storyboarding allows for new concepts to take a dasiashapepsila that can be commonly understood. This affords consensus building and promotes feedback acquisition in the early stages of the design phase, both which were prominent goals of this effort. These goals are accomplished because the scenarios developed provide a vehicle for conceptualizing interactions between the operational improvements described in the NextGen Implementation Plan on a more tangible level while also communicating their impact to various aviation and industry stakeholders. Scenarios can also facilitate cross-FAA and industry-FAA discussions for the purpose of identifying implementation gaps and, in turn, stimulate collaborative solutions which will serve to define implementation requirements. The compilation of these scenarios will help clarify the impact of operational improvements and their utilization. More importantly, the collaboration among key stakeholders as the by-product of this process will serve as the basis for successful partnerships in the FAA's progress towards NextGen.},

abstract={The success of demand management approaches to curbing flight delays is predicated on an accurate and reliable a-priori determination of airport arrival and departure capacity. The assignment of declared capacity, completed more than one year in advance, must consider the inherent variability in the actual throughput capacity for each 15 minute period during the day. For airports with large variations in airport capacity, the capacity limit must be set high enough to avoid long periods of under utilization of the airport resources and low enough to avoid extended periods of excessive delays. This paper examines: (i) the variability of throughput capacity at the OEP-35 airports during the convective weather season in 2008, (ii) established the average costs of delays due to reduced capacity and the average profits per flight at each airport, (iii) given the cost of delays and lost profits, an optimum capacity is determined at each airport to minimize both the under-utilization of airport capacity and flight delays due to variability in the available throughput capacity.},

abstract={Data Communications is a critical component in the FAAs NextGen Implementation Plan. Increasing controller-pilot efficiencies and enabling complex trajectory based operations are a key part of NextGen. While the benefits of the final NextGen data communications concept are often touted, the mid-term operational improvements can often be overlooked. The creation of advanced services data link messaging standards is important to the overall success of NextGen. Furthermore the development of accommodation and interoperability standards for the advanced services data link messages is a necessary step in realizing mid-term operational improvements. The use of data link standards available today can help stimulate the development and equipage of future data link standards. As more mid-term benefits are realized and the future standards are validated, the importance of the next generation data link standards will increase. This paper will outline the current data link messaging environment and identify the mid-term benefits associated with accommodating todays proven standards. These benefits include encouraging user equipage, promoting global harmonization, validation of NextGen concepts, and ensuring a smooth transition from voice only operations to NextGen data communications.},

These wireless broadband networks could be used to address the increasing demand for data transmissions in the airport environment. The Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) implementation of the IEEE 802.16e-2005 standard is used in this paper to evaluate the spectral requirements of an ANLE network at a large airport. A methodology is developed to estimate approximate upper bounds on spectral requirements needed to support a set of potential applications that may participate in such networks. This methodology takes into account the physical layer characteristics of the OFDMA implementation of the IEEE 802.16e standard by evaluating physical layer data rates for the various modulation and coding schemes described in the standard. The upper bounds on spectral requirements described in this paper will provide a basis for estimating the total amount of radio spectrum that may be needed by an operational ANLE system.},

abstract={The next generation air transportation system (NextGen) implementation plan (NGIP) describes the system changes and operational improvements that need to be implemented through the mid-term (2012-2018) to realize NextGen. It is anticipated that the system wide information management (SWIM) program will provide functionality that will help the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) achieve the goal of a network-enabled National Airspace System (NAS) expounded by NextGen. This paper summarizes the possible evolution of SWIM functionality/operations in the mid-term to support the capabilities contained in the NextGen solution sets, such as trajectory based operations (TBO) and reduced weather impact (RWI), which require net-centric services. Our preliminary analysis indicates that a hybrid approach to the implementation and operation of SWIM functionality is a strong candidate to support mid-term needs. In this approach, services are allocated on a case-by-case basis to be implemented and operated in a consolidated "core," or to be implemented and operated within domain-specific NAS systems. At this point, the mid-term NAS services have not been identified and allocated for deployment to individual NAS systems or to the SWIM core. Our preliminary analysis indicates that SWIM, in the mid-term, should include some services that are allocated to a consolidated SWIM core. These services should be selected to reduce cost and risk, maximize benefit, and provide a basis for building on success in subsequent segments.},

Currently, the process for monitoring compliance with various security measures is highly manual, and these restricted airspaces are for the most part not included in automated flight planning systems.

abstract={The National Airspace System (NAS) is rapidly expanding and straining the capabilities of current communications technologies. The need to implement increased capacity, security and network enabled information sharing in limited spectrum will pose a significant challenge. To address these issues in the next generation (NextGen) airspace and develop a robust future communications infrastructure, a new airport surface wireless communications system is necessary. Through an initiative known as the Future Communications Study, the FAA and NASA have endorsed the IEEE 802.16e standard as the basis for implementing future airport surface wireless communication networks. In November 2007, the World Radiocommunications Conference approved the addition of an aeronautical mobile route service frequency allocation in the 5091 - 5150 MHz band to support development of these 802.16e-based communications networks. Sensis Corporation and NASA Glenn Research Center currently operate a NextGen Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance (CNS) Test Bed in Cleveland, OH. A critical component of the Test Bed operation is an IEEE 802.1 la-based wireless mesh data communications network. Through experimental and empirical analysis, the findings from the current operation of the 802.11a-based network and recommendations for upgrade to 802.16e-based capabilities for airport surface wireless communications are provided.},

abstract={This paper provides a first look at the potential for implementing a high-bandwidth air/ground (A/G) digital networked voice and data system in the very high frequency (VHF) band. The future communication study (FCS), a joint study performed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and EUROCONTROL, evaluated several systems and found the system called broadband-aeronautical mobile communications (B-AMC) to be a leading technology candidate to supply data communications in the L-band. Based on the FAAs desire to maintain operations in the VHF band and on the 2007 World Radiocommunications Conference (WRC-07) decision to make 112 - 117.975 MHz available for aeronautical mobile communications, The MITRE Corporations Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD) investigated the feasibility of implementing B-AMC in the VHF band and determined its potential for supporting networked voice using voice over Internet protocol (VoIP). Furthermore, this study examined how the B-AMC protocol layers can be tailored to VoIP protocols in terms of meeting certain performance measures.},

pages={1-11},
abstract={Continental airlines and The MITRE corporation have collaborated in an effort to collect and analyze intent data from operational flights in the U.S. national airspace system (NAS). Flight intent in four dimensions (4D) which provides latitude, longitude, altitude and time (among other information) is being provided by continental airlines from Boeing 737-800 series aircraft equipped with GE aviation flight management system (FMS) avionics. What distinguishes this activity from earlier 4D intent downlink activities conducted in recent years is the examination of the behavior of the FMS-generated estimated time of arrival (ETA) information for upcoming points along the flight, in the absence of a required time of arrival (RTA) and the volume of the data gathered in normal, uncontrolled (by the experimenter) operations. Without the controls of an imposed RTA, the ETAs may fluctuate and could have varying levels of accuracy or utility. However, it is envisioned that 4D intent downlinks and use of ETAs will become available well before RTAs are imposed in the air traffic control (ATC) system. Therefore, the project chose to examine ETA performance in the absence of RTAs and to extend the analysis into high volumes of data from aircraft that are operated normally within the ATC system. This paper provides an overview of the project and its goals, a description of data collection; processing and analysis methods developed thus far and preliminary results. The information offers insight into a follow on phase of this project which will be the identification of operational concepts of use for FMS intent data in prediction and planning by airline operations centers (AOC) and ATC within the context of the FAA's next generation air transportation management system (NextGen).},

abstract={This paper presents an overview of the Radiofrequency (RF) coverage analysis methodology used to design and build the radio site layout in support of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)'s Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) Air Traffic Modernization Program. This layout is optimized to meet system performance, safety, and interference requirements while minimizing the number of radio station sites required for providing RF coverage in the entire airspace of the Unites States. In addition, it includes the process of designing and applying the radio station siting template for site selection process. This template provided the basis for development of computer algorithms that facilitated the selection of radio station sites during the proposal phase of ADS-B program. Because this algorithm did not take into account detailed terrain, the reverse viewshed analysis method was developed to account for terrain and optimize radio station siting, in particular, when designing for Terminal service volumes. This paper describes the utilization of reverse viewshed in radio station site selection, a method that allows for an exhaustive evaluation of all tower resources and greatly facilitates the radio site selection process. In addition, this paper provides an overview of the tool selected for the development of a model-based Service Volume engineering environment. The tool will be used to capture the service volume design and configuration parameters.},

title={Improvement of L-DACS1 design by combining B-AMC with P34 and WiMAX technologies},
year={2009},
volume={},

pages={1-8},
abstract={All currently pursued air traffic management (ATM) concepts and associated roadmaps, i.e. Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) in Europe and next generation air transportation system (NextGen) in the USA, heavily rely upon trajectory exchange between airborne and ground automated systems. Facilitating such exchanges requires high performance air-ground (A/G) data link communications. The decision about what technology the future data link shall be based upon has not yet been taken, but it is obvious, that the selected data link technology must be globally accepted and standardized. L-band digital aeronautical communication system type 1 (L-DACS1) is one of the candidate air-ground data link technologies aiming at being deployed in the aeronautical L-band (960 - 1164 MHz). In the course of the action plan 17 (API7) activities the L-DACS1 system based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been proposed to be further investigated and developed, together with another candidate technology, L-DACS2. The L-DACS1 specification has currently been developed under a EUROCONTROL contract by a team composed of FREQUENTIS, DLR, University of Salzburg and Selex communications. L-DACS1 strongly relies upon the broadband aeronautical multi-carrier communications (B- AMC) concept. One recommendation of the concluding API7 report was that the L-DACS1 design should combine that B-AMC technology with other "similar" OFDM-based technologies, primarily TIA-902 (P34) and IEEE 802.16e (WiMAX). This merging aims at further increasing the system performance and reducing implementation issues by relying on standardized technologies as far as possible. This challenging task has been recently conducted within the context of the L-DACS1 study by reviewing relevant standards and identifying items being potentially reusable within the L-DACS1 specification. This work was significantly facilitated via informal meetings and discussions with EUROCONTROL, FAA, NASA, ITT and MITRE. The authors highly appreciate the contributions of all involved parties to the consolidated work presented in this paper. The collaborative investigation of supplementary technologies revealed some highly interesting items related to the specification of airborne and ground L-DACS1 radio stations, as well as common items related to the physical layer and data link layer specification. As a consequence, the original B- AMC system design was supplemented and in some areas significantly improved by adopting specific P34 and WiMAX concepts from the related standards. This paper is based on the L-DACS1 specification as developed during the L-DACS1 study. A brief outline of the L-DACS1 design is given, highlighting the most important system features and modifications/improvements of the original B-AMC design. In the main part of the paper, the P34 and WiMAX concepts that have been considered and adopted during the L-DACS1 design phase are summarized and a rationale for their adoption is given. Additionally, explanations are provided for the P34 and WiMAX concepts that have been analyzed, but were rejected, and therefore not included in the L-DACS1 design.},

abstract={"Making predictions is hard, especially about the future" observed Yogi Berra. Making predictions about the behavior of a highly complex system-of-systems with poorly understood emergent behavior, such as the National Airspace System (NAS), is all the more so. The U.S. aviation community has embarked upon a mission to transform itself to a vision of the next generation air transportation system (NextGen). In doing so, a range of challenges must be overcome encompassing operational, technical, and policy considerations. It is becoming widely recognized that a major set of challenges address the business considerations of a range of investing stakeholders who will need to spend billions of dollars to realize that transformation. The most daunting challenge is that these investments will need to be synchronized across a variety of commercial enterprises, government agencies, and other actors. This paper addresses the methodology for establishing and synchronizing business cases with a focus on formulation of alternate portfolios within the context of NextGen.},

The integrative concept of implementation of these procedures would mean a migration away from site by site (or runway by runway) procedure implementation process towards a NextGen readiness concept. This concept will include development of an integrated system of PBN routes and procedures by geographic area (incorporating metro areas and outlying airports). This concept delivers optimum benefits for the air traffic and carrier community.

abstract={The analysis of large sums of data can be extremely difficult to perform if the data is not presented graphically. As a result, many graphing techniques have been developed, such as scatter plots, histograms. Generally, the main purpose of graphically displaying data is to do one of two things: First, to find the general average of where most of the data lies. Second, to find the outliers, the data points that are most distant from the others. Our visualization will attempt to find both by using a multitude of common graphing techniques to expand upon the traditional star glyph and create a new way of graphing data. These techniques include clustering, using color as identifiers, and 3D graphing capabilities to present more data that would not be possible of being shown in a two dimensional environment. We apply our techniques to compare several air traffic trajectory predictors currently being analyzed by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.},

Audiences often walk away from presentations not knowing what the key message was and unsure of actions they should take as a result of the briefing. Although successful communication techniques are well known and documented, corporations sometimes have difficulty encouraging their technical staff to use them. This paper describes the results of a four-part communications strategy that was implemented at a large engineering firm. The purpose of the effort was to improve the ability of staff to communicate technical topics to a variety of audiences, and bridge the gap between theory and practice. The strategy consists of developing a clear step-by-step process, followed by training, offering quick turnaround support, and cultivating senior management support. Several important lessons were learned during implementation. Firstly, a clear process is important to engineers, who are the target audience for the training, because the clear process provides predictability and transparency. Secondly, branding the effort improves its visibility and acceptance. Thirdly, localizing the training by using specific examples demonstrates the application of key principles and increases acceptance and usage by staff. Several follow-up steps are planned, including development of an annual award for most effective communication. All of these activities reinforce the expectation that improving communications is a long-term corporate goal, demonstrated to produce results and expected as part of every staff member's duties.},

First, the operating principles of a magnetic levitation system with two moving magnets are introduced. Then, due to the exact dynamic model of the MIMO magnetic levitation system is not clear, two MENNs are combined to be a direct MENN-based decentralized controller to deal with the highly nonlinear and unstable MIMO magnetic levitation system. Moreover, the connective weights of the MENNs are trained online by backpropagation (BP) methodology. Based on the direct and decentralized concepts, the computational burden is reduced and the controller design is simplified. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the proposed control scheme can control the magnets to track periodic sinusoidal reference trajectory simultaneously in different operating conditions effectively.},

abstract={Transformer condition should be maintained because of its importance to electricity network. Each utility, in this case PLN P3B Jawa-Bali, has to assure their reliability in order to maintain electrical power system stability by assessing transformer conditions. Once transformer condition attained, appropriate maintenance and operation strategy can be defined. The most important things influence transformer condition is its insulation. Since transformer insulation is also influenced by thermal stress, another stresses also influence insulation condition i.e. chemical, electrical and mechanical stress. We calculate FAA (factor accelerated aging) of the transformer by estimating hot spot from top oil temperature. Calculated FAA is correlated to dissolved gasses analysis (DGA) and oil quality analysis (OQA). Data used were taken from 150/20 kV 60 MVA power transformer from the year of 2007 until 2008.},

In the development of an embedded system, it is important to be able to determine if the system meets specifications and if its outputs are correct. This is the process of V&V. Airbus applied this V&V process in safety assessment on A380 from aircraft level to supplier level. Aircraft level safety process was implemented for the first time on a large-scale commercial aircraft. To ensure the achievement of goal reliability before entry into service, Airbus has put in more tests on A380 beyond the safety requirements from FAA.

Based on analysis, five characteristics have been identified from an assortment of SoS descriptions. These characteristics are named autonomy, belonging, connectivity, diversity, and emergence, whose degrees of strength determines the foundation of any SoS. To utilize these characteristics, concrete definitions are presented in context and then applied to the development of a theoretical model. The resulting model forms the basis of a generic SoS instantiated as an agent-based modeling simulation. This simulation demonstrates the appropriateness of the characteristics and can be used to explore further aspects of a SoS. Modeling and experimenting on these characteristics will contribute to the field of systems engineering by providing a means to increase our understanding of SoS.},

abstract={The local area augmentation system (LAAS) is a differential GPS navigation system being developed to support aircraft precision approach and landing navigation with guaranteed integrity and availability. While the system promises to support Category I operations, significant technical challenges are encountered in supporting Category II and III operations. The primary concern has been the need to guarantee compliance with stringent requirements for navigation availability. This paper describes how a position domain method (PDM) may be used to improve system availability by reducing the inflation factor for standard deviations of pseudo-range correction errors. Used in combination with the current range domain method (RDM), a 30% reduction in the inflation factor is achieved with the same safety standard. LAAS prototype testing verifies the utility of the PDM to enhance Category II/III user availability.},

abstract={As the aviation community moves toward the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), the current Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS II) may become inadequate. This paper presents a novel approach to detection and resolution of air traffic conflicts in a 3-dimensional (3-D) airspace between two aircraft. The inputs to the detection algorithm are the current 3-D position and speed vector of both aircraft and a cylindrical minimum safety protection zone (PZ). For collision avoidance systems (CASs), the size of the configurable PZ can be assigned values that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) considers as a near mid air collision (NMAC1) incident. When available, additional inputs, such as measurement uncertainties and intruder type (e.g., manned/unmanned), can be used to alter the default protection zone. The conflict detection takes into account the 3-D encounter (e.g., closure rate, miss distance, relative converging maneuver). The resolution algorithm initially computes a set of six resolution advisories (RAs) and associated resolution alert times that ensure no violation of the protection zone. Two solutions are computed for each of the three dimensions: ground track, ground speed, and vertical speed. The initial resolution advisories (RAs) solutions take into account ownship capability (i.e., max climb/descent rate, max turn rate, max speed/stall speed) and ownship pilot response delay (e.g., autonomous vs. manual RA execution). These six solutions are subsequently down-selected in two steps: first, based on the encounter geometry, a single implicitly coordinated, independent solution is selected for each of the three dimensions; then, based on ownship preferences and operational considerations a final RA solution is computed.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming more prevalent in military applications and through the success of these applications, many commercial usages have been derived. However, due to the recent development of UAVs, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not yet been able to develop performance requirements for the Detect, Sense, and Avoid (DSA) system of UAVs. For this reason, this study serves to explore the current capabilities of human general aviation (GA) pilots with regards to their see-and-avoid abilities. The midair collision rate over the past ten years and the average traffic around an average airport are also explored. With the analyzed data, a model is developed in order to extract the grounds for performance requirement for DSA systems. The determined DSA performance number can be used to further aid in the development of overall performance requirements for DSA systems.},

abstract={As a relatively young mission area, Airspace Security offers many interesting opportunities for system engineering. Little formal documentation of the systems and operations exist, and many of the procedures and capabilities used have evolved in an expedient manner to meet urgent mission needs. The success of the mission to date is a testament to the experience and dedication of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operational security personnel and their mission partners in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense (DoD), and other agencies, as well as civil National Airspace System (NAS) users. Achieving the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) vision will depend upon leveraging the current operational knowledge and capabilities, while integrating security more closely with trajectory-based operations, collaborative Air Traffic Management (ATM) and utilizing the infrastructure provided by net-centric operations and information sharing. This will be accomplished in part by applying system engineering principles and techniques to derive the NextGen system requirements. This paper will describe the system engineering processes used to begin modernization of the FAA's airspace security capabilities as documented in the NextGen Implementation Plan. The focus of this paper will be on two specific analyses: first, the Goal Directed Task Analysis (GDTA); and second, the functional analysis for the Security Integrated Tool Suite (SITS).},

abstract={Aircraft loss-of-control accidents account for about 38% of the fatal accidents in U.S. General Aviation operations each year. Loss-of-control accidents include VFR-into-IMC with subsequent disorientation and loss of aircraft control, low-speed stall-spin accidents in the airport traffic pattern, and high-speed accelerated stall accidents during low-level maneuvering. The majority of these accidents could be prevented by full-time flight envelope protection having functionality similar to that available in fly-by-wire systems on newer military and civil transport aircraft. However, fly-by-wire systems would likely be prohibitively expensive to implement in most GA aircraft; and would be impractical for retrofit applications. Under FAA sponsorship, we are developing a new approach to GA Envelope Protection that preserves the existing cable control system, while providing full-time pilot-in-the-loop stability augmentation and flight-envelope protection. This approach, called Force Gradient Control, is made possible by leveraging a new concept in the design of autopilot servos. Under this development effort, we are working to validate feedback control algorithms using a high-fidelity ground-based simulator, in preparation for flight demonstrations using a representative light aircraft. This approach to preventing loss-of-control accidents should be economically viable for both retrofit and forward-fit applications within the General Aviation light-aircraft fleet.},

Traffic levels were set at two times (2X) and three times (3X) current day levels and the handling of tactical conflict situations was done either with or without support from tactical separation assisted flight environment (TSAFE) automation. Strategic conflicts and all routine tasks performed in today's system were handled by ground-based automation. This paper focuses on the response strategies observed in two scripted tactical conflict situations and how they differed according to whether or not automated resolution support was provided by TSAFE. An examination of the two situations revealed that when TSAFE automation was active, participants tended to provide additional, complementary maneuvers to supplement the tactical vector issued by TSAFE. This also included a greater tendency to use both aircraft in a conflict pair. When TSAFE support was not available, participants tended to use single vector or altitude maneuvers and were more likely to attempt resolutions using a single aircraft as well. Some issues that arose through the operations simulated in this study related to the need for the air navigation service provider (ANSP) to be able to have final authority over the issuance of TSAFE maneuvers as well as the importance of having awareness of the immediate traffic situation in making effective and safe time-critical decisions.},

abstract={The widespread placement of runway visual range (RVR) visibility sensors over an airport domain provides an opportunity to expand their utility to other airport applications. These include determining visibility and inferring equivalent liquid water content snowfall rates anywhere on the airport surface. The interpolation of extinction coefficient measurements is demonstrated at Denver International Airport (DEN) and Portland International Airport (PDX). The snowfall rate determination is demonstrated at DEN, using calibration of visibility sensor extinction coefficient measurements based on an equivalent snowfall water content gauge located nearby one of the RVR visibility sensors. The snowfall rate data are shown to be useful for tracking equivalent liquid water snowfall amounts that can accumulate on an aircraft during taxiing from a deicing station to a takeoff position on a runway. This tracking of snowfall impinging on an aircraft along its designated surface route should help ensure safer deicing decision making. Furthermore, ongoing evaluation of aircraft tracks for takeoff on different runways can provide controllers with options on runway selection to enhance capacity. The time portrayal of interpolated images of visibility at DEN and PDX demonstrates how visibility can differ significantly over an airport surface and how this visibility can drift in time. Similar to the snowfall application, the interpolated visibility along surface routes to and from runways can help controllers improve estimates of times required for safe transit of aircraft during taxiing.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Surveillance and Broadcast Services (SBS) Program Office and the Colorado Department of Transportation are implementing Wide Area Multilateration (WAM) in Non-Radar Airspace (NRA) to improve air traffic services at and around routes and fixes that support operations at Hayden/Yampa Valley (HDN), Craig-Moffat (CAG), Steamboat Springs/Bob Adams Field (SBS), and Garfield County Regional - Rifle (RIL) airports. In particular, the lack of comprehensive radar surveillance at and below 10,000 ft. in these regions requires controllers to use procedural separation standards for the Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) arriving/departing aircraft. While this is a safe means of providing service, it is inefficient for current traffic and especially for expected demand growth. Wide Area Multilateration is a distributed surveillance technology that utilizes a constellation of ground stations to provide surveillance coverage within a defined region. This technology makes use of signals transmitted from Air Traffic Control Radio Beacon System (ATCRBS) (Modes A and C) and Mode S transponders, in response to interrogations. The Mode S transponders also provide the squitter message once per second. The implementation, certification, and commissioning of WAM would enable air traffic controllers to apply more efficient separation standards for aircraft operating in the affected airspaces. For this operational environment, with WAM as the surveillance technology, the FAA seeks to achieve 5 NMI lateral/longitudinal separations. This paper describes the technical results from the data modeling, controlled flight test, and targets of opportunity analysis for the WAM sensor constellations near HDN and RIL to support separation standards within the Host Computer System (HCS) automation platform environment at Denver Center (ZDV).

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) surveillance and broadcast services (SBS) program office is implementing a ground infrastructure that supports the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data service. One of the main applications of this new surveillance service will be to support air traffic control (ATC) separation procedures that are performed exclusively with radar surveillance today. As part of the initial activities to assess the system, the ADS-B data is being incorporated into four different automation platforms in four different key sites. The first key site to integrate ADS-B data is the Louisville Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) which uses common automated radar terminal system (Common ARTS) to process and display radar data to controllers today. The Louisville Common ARTS has been augmented to accept ADS-B data and display aircraft using system track positions that are calculated from a variety of surveillance inputs, including multiple radars and ADS-B. As part of the SBS evaluation, a working group was created that worked specifically to evaluate the end-end performance in terminal separation applications of the ADS-B avionics, ADS-B surveillance service on the ground, and the updated Common ARTS software. The evaluation used a comparative approach with current monopulse secondary surveillance radar (MSSR) systems as a baseline; if the new system performed as good or better than MSSR systems in separation applications, then the system was acceptable for operation. This paper summarizes some of the efforts of that SBS working group to evaluate the operational performance in Louisville, including the metrics, assumptions made, scenarios developed for evaluation, and results from simulation, analysis of targets of opportunity (TOO), and controlled flight testing.},

abstract={Special Use Airspace (SUA) are volumes of airspace wherein limitations are placed on the activity of civilian air traffic. For example, many SUAs are used for training missions by the U.S. military, and, when ldquoclosed,rdquo are off-limits to civilian air traffic. Historically, SUA status information (SUA is open vs. closed to civilians) has been known to the military, but not always conveyed to civilian airspace users/managers in a timely fashion. A proposed new capability of the modernized Traffic Flow Management (TFM) system is called Collaborative Information Exchange (CIX) - it remedies this situation by enabling the real-time sharing of SUA current and future state. This enables flights to flight-plan and fly routes that agree, based on the status of the SUA. The authors performed a benefits analysis as part of the justification for the proposed capability. Rather than relying on a possibly-inaccurate schedule for SUA status, we focused on two cases: 1) Flight path is planned through the SUA, but actual aircraft track flies around it, 2) Flight path is planned around the SUA, but actual aircraft track flies through it. These two cases are indications that, at least at time of takeoff, the known SUA status was not the same as when the flight approached the SUA while in flight. Two benefits mechanisms were surmised for the analysis: the unnecessary ferrying of fuel and inefficient flight paths. The presentation of results will include estimated dollar savings, as well as graphical depictions of the various cases.},

abstract={Despite the existence of several automated air traffic conflict resolution algorithms, there is a need for formulations that account for air traffic controller workload. This paper presents such an algorithm with controller workload constraints modeled parametrically. To this end, we first develop an integer programming model for general conflict resolution, which emphasizes the minimization of fuel costs, and runs in near real-time. A parametric procedure based on this model is then developed to consider controller workload limitations. Two versions of the parametric approach are described, along with computational results. It is demonstrated that both formulations can be used to capture a broad range of possible controller actions.},

pages={3.C.2-1-3.C.2-7},
abstract={Severe en route weather is one of the major challenges for both Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airspace managers and for airline and other airspace users. Uncertainty associated with changing weather patterns and severity, coupled with uncertainty in how airlines and other aircraft operators will react to the changing weather creates a significant challenge for traffic managers (TMs). TMs must decide, with limited information, how best to handle likely imbalances between available airspace capacity that will change over time due to dynamic weather conditions and air traffic demand for that airspace which also is changing over time as different aircraft operators seek to best meet their respective business needs. A planned enhancement to the traffic management automation system, the Collaborative Airspace Congestion Resolution (CACR) capability allows TMs to effectively and efficiently manage airspace congestion in a tactical time frame (0-2 hours). CACR has four key components: it predicts sector demand and its associated uncertainty; it predicts sector capacity including the impact of weather; it identifies the problem; and, it generates congestion resolution plans. The purpose of the analysis was to determine the benefits of using the CACR capability. The benefits analysis was performed by assessing the reduced flight and ground delays achieved by using the capability in a severe weather situation which also occurred in the tactical timeframe. The approach for estimating the benefits of CACR was to rerun two historical bad-weather days in the NAS, and to create a situation in which the analysts played the role of TM to solve the problem of excess air traffic demand in light of weather-impacted sector capacities. Two simulated runs were performed for each day, with one simulating today's operations using playbooks for rerouting and the other one simulating the future by utilizing the CACR capability. The benefits were determined by calculating the difference of the ground delay and flight time for each simulated run.},

abstract={The super heavy transport is one of the advanced vehicles envisioned in the future aviation systems. Due to its size and operational characteristics, some impact on the surface movements of other conventional vehicles is expected. Current practices regarding Airbus A380 aircraft at some U.S. airports might give us a clue as to how much such an impact would be. We have conducted descriptive analyses on taxi activities at two U.S. airports that currently have A380 operations and investigated the taxi delay of those operations around an A380 operation. Several possible cases are identified where super heavy transport could potentially cause interference with other surface movements. Corresponding models are then proposed to help incorporate the super heavy transport impact on surface movement into a large-scale simulation tool, and these are demonstrated with a hypothetical flight schedule. With the limitation of publicly accessible data sources, suitable statistical methods are applied to quantify the taxi delay due to super heavy transports, which is a necessary input of the proposed models.},

year={2009},
volume={},
number={},
pages={3.A.5-1-3.A.5-10},
abstract={Local meteorological conditions such as wind direction, cloud ceiling heights, and visibility directly influence the safety and efficiency of an airport. The safety and efficiency, generally contradictory, are associated with the selection of a particular runway configuration that is a part of job of airport tower controllers. When the wind speed and directions exceed the maximum allowable limit defined by the FAA operational procedures, controllers must change runway configurations. During this configuration change, the status of all arriving and departing aircrafts are turned into airborne or ground holding, respectively, until the new flight paths and the new taxi paths are clarified. This situation greatly influences the airport operational efficiency with its associated cost of delays, fuel burn and emissions. Despite its prominence, only a few studies that discuss the timing of decision-making for the configuration change can be found. In this study, an innovative decision-making approach is proposed for runway configuration planning under stochastic wind conditions. The goal of the decision-making approach is to maximize the airport throughput and minimize the airborne delay in terminal area, given a sequence of wind forecast data. The optimization techniques of dynamic programming and backwards induction are used to solve the probabilistic optimality equation. Based on the simulation results of JFK test case, the proposed approach is shown to reduce the average delay time and improve the throughput of runway systems without violating operational procedures.},

abstract={The next generation air transportation system (NextGen) calls for the extensive use of trajectory management for aircraft to achieve precision flight paths. To understand, develop, and model systems that support these NextGen operations, especially in the terminal area, NASA is looking at today's precision operations to gain insight into the expected behavior. This paper documents characteristics of aircraft that are both on and vectored from routes in the execution of area navigation (RNAV) precision departures to support precision modeling and provide for NextGen super density operations research. Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) was selected for this case study as these kinds of precise departure procedures have been in daily use there for years. One-third of DFW RNAV departures encounter some form of vectoring away from the defined RNAV routes. The majority of these, about one-quarter of the departures, are given direct routings that bypass fixes on the route and shorten the distance flown within the terminal radar approach control (TRACON). These divergences primarily result from controllers taking advantage of opportunities in the airborne traffic, similar to direct-to routing in enroute airspace, and are not the result of departure sequencing or avoiding loss of separation. During the planning of the RNAV procedures, some of this vectoring was expected and even encouraged, but the number of aircraft so affected has grown over time. Pilots and air traffic controllers use the precision navigation capability required for the RNAV departure procedures to bypass portions of the routes. While this is applicable to DFW alone, it is a reminder that the human elements in the system frequently find new and innovative uses for elements of the procedures, or the technology behind them. The numbers of aircraft vectored in the course of RNAV departure operations is comparable to those departing with reduced spacing, the main benefit of the original RNAV implementation. The data presented here demonstrate the flexibility of the procedures as currently used.},

abstract={In a previous paper we outlined an operational concept for managing traffic in Super Dense Operations (SDO) airspace based on a knowledge elicitation effort involving traffic managers and pilots. In this paper we extend this effort, soliciting feedback from a new set of 10 experienced controllers, asking them to evaluate the assumptions and design recommendations making up this operational concept. In the previous paper at this conference, we presented an operational concept for the functioning of airspace operating under Super Density Operations (SDO) that assumes that, in the mid-term (2018) the controllers for SDO for Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) airspace are still responsible for separation assurance and for the merging and spacing of arrivals, departures and overflights. The concept further proposes extensive use of procedural separation based on a predefined ¿plays¿ based on a set of alternative advanced Area Navigation (RNAV) arrival and departure routes and based on a set of alternatives for using airspace for arrivals and departures. Assuming datalink capabilities to communicate a new route to the flight deck, the concept further allows for dynamically generated advanced RNAV arrival and departure routes when the set of predefined ¿plays¿ is insufficient to deal with weather or traffic constraints. In general, the participants were strongly in favor of having predefined route and airspace structures in SDO airspace, with the ability to deal with weather and traffic constraints using predefined alternatives or ¿plays¿ whenever possible, but considering dynamically generated route and airspace structures when the predefined ¿plays¿ are inadequate. Additional details are provided below.},

Simplified dynamic density is a weighted sum of seven traffic components that contribute to airspace complexity. Constant and variable estimates of maximum sector capacity, based on projected flight tracks, are used to constrain the traffic demand in fast-time simulations. Delays and aircraft counts resulting from these methods are compared with those obtained using the capacities in the current system and based on the ¿5/3 of average sector flight time¿ rule. Results show that the simplified dynamic density based capacities produce lower system-wide delays and more throughputs, and indicate more predictable air traffic demands during the peak traffic period.},

Significant increases in air traffic levels have lead to the development of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) which includes improved automation and tools to ease the workload of air traffic controllers. Several ground-based automation tools, such as the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) and Data Communication (DataComm), are planned for wide implementation for the NextGen mid-term timeframe.

Residual data was also analyzed to investigate perceived complexity differences in different traffic and DataComm conditions. The findings of the exercise are discussed.},

One of the key ETMS functions is to predict the future demand for elements of the National Airspace System (NAS) - airports, sectors, and fixes. The main source of ETMS errors in demand prediction is directly attributed to departure time errors. Departure times enter the system with flight plans filed by NAS users. This study evaluated archived historical data of ETMS operations. Analysis of one month of data yielded an algorithm that mitigated departure time errors in cases of significant airport delays. The core of the algorithm consisted of: middot heuristic filtering criteria that told when a correction had to be applied to departure time estimates; middot the technique of improving the estimates for the cases that passed the criteria. The algorithm was validated using 5+ years of archived data for 34 pacing airports and showed substantial improvement in departure time estimates. For every month of data, the filtering criteria had selected between 2%-8% of wheels-up time estimate cases. For these cases, monthly average estimates improved by 5-10 minutes (about 20%). The improvements were especially good for cases when lead time to departure was smaller than 15 minutes: of these 35% were impacted with the average improvement of about 11 minutes. The good and stable performance of the algorithm provides a reasonable expectation for improved departure time predictions if the algorithm is deployed within the context of operational ETMS.},

abstract={As the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) moves forward with plans to evolve operations of the National Airspace System (NAS), as well as to achieve the various operational improvements described by the next generation air transportation system (NextGen) implementation plan, there is an increasing need to assess a broad range of solutions in a systematic manner to determine which will prove most desirable for implementation. Discriminating between these concepts can be a difficult task because of the variability in the level of detail that exists and the different air traffic management (ATM) aspects that are described. Understanding these differences is important because of their far-reaching impact to the NAS evolution path.},

abstract={As fleet avionics continue to evolve, the use of the solutions provided by performance-based navigation (PBN) will continue to grow and provide benefits to the aircraft operators. Due to these potential benefits, several air carriers in the United States have announced plans to retro-fit their fleets with PBN capabilities. However, it is important to understand the current snapshot of avionics, as well as the historic growth before analyzing the future forward-fit scenarios. Since 2004, the MITRE Corporation's Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD) has monitored the navigational avionics for Part 121 United States airlines. In this time span, the number of Part 121 airframes has dropped by more than 400 aircraft while the number of Part 121 aircraft with a flight management computer (FMC) has grown at approximately the same rate. This has resulted in a fleet wide growth in the percent of aircraft operating with an FMC from 79% to 90%. Also, the number of aircraft operating with a Global Positioning System (GPS) (also known as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) navigational sensor) has grown with 1,100 additional aircraft operating with a GNSS sensor today. This has resulted in a growth from 47% of the aircraft in 2004 to 66% of the aircraft. There have been three primary reasons for the growth of PBN operational capability: equipped aircraft delivered to the system, current fleet retro-fits, and new knowledge of the airline operators. This paper will discuss the current equipage trends, capability, and identify the evolutionary change in Part 121 PBN avionics from 2004 through 2008. Additionally, this paper will discuss the next generation of aircraft and potential future scenarios for fleet avionics.},

abstract={The differences in performance of various manufacturers' flight management systems (FMSs) and their associated flight management computers (FMCs) have the potential for significant impact on the air traffic control system and as such need to be examined and reexamined. While area navigation (RNAV) and required navigation performance (RNP) procedures and routes are designed according to criteria contained in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) orders, FMC manufacturers build their systems in accordance with minimum aviation system performance standards (MASPS) and minimum operational performance standards (MOPS) for area navigation systems, technical service orders and advisory circulars. It is anticipated that the resulting performance of the aircraft FMC will meet the procedure design requirements identified in the FAA criteria. Airlines and air traffic controllers have as their goal flight procedures where aircraft operations meet expectations for repeatability and predictability to levels of performance sufficient to support performance based operations in the National Airspace System (NAS). Sometimes, due to the nearly independent development of procedure design criteria and aircraft performance standards, the paths of various aircraft on the same procedure do not overlap and do not match the expectancy of the procedure designer. These differences may result from any or all of the following: variations in FMC equipment installed on the aircraft; variations and errors in procedure coding in the FMC navigation database; variations in aircraft-to-FMC interface and associated aircraft performance capabilities; and variations in flight crew training and procedures. The hypothesis of this paper is that the basic FMCs built by avionics manufacturers and installed as the core of the FMC/FMS combinations in various airframe platforms perform differently and we will attempt to quantify those differences. This paper focuses on aspects of lateral and vertical flight FMC performance when processing mandatory block altitudes, aircraft bank angle on turns above flight level nineteen thousand five hundred feet (FL195), determining the vertical transition point at fly-by waypoints, and execution of optimized profile descents (OPDs). Public instrument procedures flown using RNAV are used as the baseline for measuring performance variations. Controlled field observations trials were made using thirteen test benches and four simulators at seven major FMC manufacturers and three airlines. The intent of this report is to contribute technical data as a foundation for the acceptance of mandatory block altitude usage in RNAV and basic RNP procedures; allow standard instrument departure (SID) and standard arrival (STAR) procedure design criteria to utilize bank angles in excess of five degrees above FL195; satisfy an open FAA/Industry Aeronautical Charting Forum issue concerning the vertical transition point at fly-by waypoints; and assess FMC processing of an optimized profile descent.},

abstract={Geocasting is a mechanism to disseminate data messages within a certain geographical region. Since packet forwarding is based on the location information of nodes, it is known to reduce the path maintenance cost significantly. The geocasting can be suitable for several applications in tactical ad hoc networks, such as an event to alarm enemy's missile attack, guerilla appearance, or local weathercast. However, previous geocast protocols proposed for general ad hoc networks are not satisfactory for the high demands of the reliability in such military applications. In this paper, we propose more reliable geocasting protocol which utilizes dual paths to improve the possibility of the successful message delivery. Moreover the proposed scheme provides two different acknowledge mechanisms, by which a source node can be confirmed of the destined nodes' message reception. Our simulation study using ns-2 shows that the proposed protocol results in high delivery ratio with reasonable packet overhead and latency.},

abstract={In this paper, a filtering-type sliding-mode control with a radial basis function network (FSCRBFN) for a two-axis motion control system, which consists of two permanent magnet linear synchronous motors (PMLSMs), is proposed. First, the dynamics of the single-axis motion system with a lumped uncertainty which contains parameter variations, external disturbances, cross-coupled interference and nonlinear friction force is derived. Next, a filtering-type sliding-mode control (FSC) is adopted for the two-axis motion control system to confront the lumped uncertainty. Then, to improve the control performance in contour tracking, the FSCRBFN control approach is developed. In the control approach, a radial basis function network (RBFN) is employed mainly to estimate the lumped uncertainty. Moreover, the proposed control approach is performed on a digital signal process (DSP)-based control system using TMS320C32. Finally, some experimental results are illustrated to show the validity of the proposed control approach.},

abstract={One of the major threats to cyber security is the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. In this paper, we focus on three kinds of sophisticated DDoS attacks that seriously cripple the current DDoS defense systems and have not been solved yet. In fast adaptive attacks (FAAs), attackers adaptively generate attacking traffic based on the feedback from a victim in round trip time (RTT). Almost all proposed rules-based filtering schemes cannot effectively defend against FAAs, since they need a relatively long time (compared to RTT) to update filtering rules. In adaptive attacks with statistical filtering rules scanning (AAS), attackers circumvent the defense system by discovering the statistical filtering rules of the defense system and then generating flooding traffic to mimic nominal traffic. In low rate TCP attacks (LRAs), attackers send periodic attack pulses to overflow a router's buffer and force the legitimate TCP flow to a low throughput while staying under the radar with a very low average rate. In this paper, we propose a leaky-bucket (LB) based highly robust DDoS defense system, called RateGuard. It can react to FAAs and LRAs by rate-limiting excessive traffic in real-time according to the victim's nominal traffic profile. Moreover, by associating an LB with each joint attribute value, the huge space required for possible joint attribute values makes it almost impossible for attackers to scan the victim's nominal traffic profiles and, thus, makes it highly robust to cope with AAS and other sophisticated attacks.},

abstract={The LRAFB C-130 engine repair facility is one of the top T-56 engine refurbishing plants in the United States Air Force. Currently, the shop is prevented from testing potential contingencies within their environment due to the rapid nature of their engine repair process. A simulation approach is needed to test various scenarios and determine the maximum capacity the shop can handle in its current configuration. Particularly, the simulation describes the consequences of increasing engine production on the shops personnel and throughput production figures for several policy variations. A detailed verification and validation of the model are shown, establishing the computational efficacy of the model in preparation for the comparative analysis. The model is a starting block for an Air Force wide analysis of C-130 engine rebuilding production needs with an overarching goal of standardization in repair methods and efficient operations.},

title={A simulation framework to evaluate airport gate allocation policies under extreme delay conditions},
year={2009},

pages={2332-2342},
abstract={Severe weather can lead to significant runway capacity reductions. Runway priority is typically given to inbound flights, thus fewer flights depart and fewer gates become available for arriving aircraft, leading to delays on the tarmac. We provide a simulation-based framework for evaluating gate allocation policies under reduced runway capacity. We first analyze a simple example, demonstrating the complexity of the problem and some key insights into different operating policies. Having shown that even simple scenarios can be difficult (if not impossible) to evaluate in closed form, we turn to simulation. We model the impact of reduced runway capacity on inbound and outbound flights by considering a major U.S. airport and its legacy carrier, focusing on the impact of delays on passengers. The contributions of this work are to highlight the challenges of accurately modeling the impact of runway capacity reductions and to present a simulation-based framework for evaluating operational policies.},

abstract={Historically, the use of simulation has been an important aspect of training in some fields (such as aviation). As the cost of computing power decreases simulation is now finding its way into training for other fields. As simulation moves into these other fields, it is increasingly moving away from traditional large hardware systems (e.g., full-motion simulators) to rich virtual environments such as serious games. However, matching the most efficient type and category of simulation to train specific learning needs is a specialized skill and there is a shortage or gap in the training of simulation specialists who can effectively design and employ training simulation. The skills needed by these professionals are presented and a program that has been established to train professionals in developing these required skills is discussed.},

abstract={There are many remote airfields that are not connected to the power grid. Providing adequate lighting to these airfields is necessary and challenging. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has sponsored a research project, Remote Airfield Lighting Systems (RALS), through the Center for General Aviation Research (CGAR). The findings from the RALS research specified a light that had low power needs and a color/intensity to meet the requirements for airfield identification and landing. To make these lights more appropriate to wide spread applications, the research team is conducting an exemplary operational test. In this paper, we discuss the new functions added to these lights for the operational test, including both automatically/remotely switching on/off the lights and smart charging of the batteries using solar panels under the control of a microcontroller. In addition, we consider future new functions such as low cost pilot controlled lighting as well as wireless networking for health monitoring and controlling of the lighting system. These new functions can greatly improve the convenience of the usage of RALS while keeping the same low cost.},

abstract={At present, it is supposed the integrity risk parameter of the Local Airport Monitor (LAM) is same with that of Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS), without considering the impact of the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) fault. In the paper, a novel risk allocation method for the integrity of LAM is proposed, which considers both the integrity impacts of the LAAS fault and the WAAS fault. Firstly, some analysis results show that both the LAAS fault and the WAAS fault will cause the LAM fault. Based on the characteristics of the LAAS fault and the WAAS fault, their integrity risk weights are computed. Moreover, some improvements are made to the conventional LAAS integrity risk allocation method: the H0 (no fault) risk and the H1 (single fault) risk of LAAS are not allotted averagely, but allotted depending on their impacts. Through theory analysis and simulations, reasonable weighted coefficients for the integrity risk allocation are gained.},

abstract={A field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based intelligent-complementary sliding-mode control (ICSMC) is proposed in this paper to control the mover of a permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) servo-drive system to track periodic-reference trajectories. First, the dynamics of the field-oriented control PMLSM servo drive with a lumped uncertainty, which contains parameter variations, external disturbances, and nonlinear-friction force, is derived. Then, to achieve the required high-control performance, the ICSMC is developed. In this approach, a radial-basis function-network (RBFN) estimator with accurate approximation capability is employed to estimate the lumped uncertainty directly. Moreover, the adaptive-learning algorithms for the online training of the RBFN are derived using the Lyapunov theorem to guarantee the closed-loop stability. Furthermore, the FPGA chip is adopted to implement the developed control and online learning algorithms for possible low-cost and high-performance industrial applications using PMLSM. Finally, some experimental results are illustrated to show the validity of the proposed control approach.},

year={2010},
volume={},

pages={169-174},
abstract={A runway incursion is the erroneous presence of an aircraft or other object on the runway. Runway incursions are rare precursors to aviation accidents and result from a variety of complex factors. Current quantitative methods are inadequate for analysis, forecasting, and understanding the risk profiles of airports. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) biennially employs runway safety action teams (RSATs) to evaluate airports with the aim of reducing runway incursions. This manuscript describes the development of a decision-making tool that combines systems methodologies to help the FAA select airports at which employing RSATs would be the most beneficial for the reduction of collision risk. These methodologies include hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP). HBM leverages the similarities between airports through conditioning incursion rate estimates on both historical data and the data sampled from hyper-distributions fitted using data from similar airports. AHP decomposes these RSAT placement decisions into a hierarchy of decisions to be examined independently; as the system evolves, the method allows the FAA to reflect changes in its knowledge and preferences in the weights of corresponding risk factors. The key deliverable of this project, a workbook decision tool, places HBM within the AHP hierarchy. The final methodology output presents an ordered list of airports according to potential risk-reduction from RSATs. This combination further incorporates risk-based and decision-based approaches in order to better allocate resources and reduce runway incursions. The tool meets project goals by utilizing the FAA's data to provide an analytically justifiable prioritized list, while building on current best practices for the RSAT selection process.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the optimization problem of resource allocation in downlink of multiuser MISO-OFDM system. Multiple users with different BER and minimum transmission rate requirements are considered. We propose a novel heuristic allocation algorithm (HAA) of radio resource, which minimizes the total transmit power of the base station while meeting individual users'QoS requirements. The proposed algorithm combines antenna selection, subcarrier, bit and power allocation together, pre-estimating number of subcarriers assigned to each user and number of bits loaded for each subcarrier to reduce search number, reducing about 8 dB average bit SNR comparing with fixed allocation algorithm (FAA), and acquiring asymptotic average bit SNR of optimal allocation algorithm (OAA) with much lower complexity.},

The concentrations of copper and nickel in edible part of hybrid fish increased with total length and body weight while the zinc concentration showed a decreasing trend with total length and body weight, although the correlation was not significant. Metal concentrations were not significantly related with condition factor of fish in random samples but results were significant when relationship was observed in tight size ranges.

abstract={This study presents a robust nonsingular terminal sliding-mode control (RNTSMC) system to achieve finite time tracking control (FTTC) for the rotor position in the axial direction of a nonlinear thrust active magnetic bearing (TAMB) system. Compared with conventional sliding-mode control (SMC) with linear sliding surface, terminal sliding-mode control (TSMC) with nonlinear terminal sliding surface provides faster, finite time convergence, and higher control precision. In this study, first, the operating principles and dynamic model of the TAMB system using a linearized electromagnetic force model are introduced. Then, the TSMC system is designed for the TAMB to achieve FTTC. Moreover, in order to overcome the singularity problem of the TSMC, a nonsingular terminal sliding-mode control (NTSMC) system is proposed. Furthermore, since the control characteristics of the TAMB are highly nonlinear and time-varying, the RNTSMC system with a recurrent Hermite neural network (RHNN) uncertainty estimator is proposed to improve the control performance and increase the robustness of the TAMB control system. Using the proposed RNTSMC system, the bound of the lumped uncertainty of the TAMB is not required to be known in advance. Finally, some experimental results for the tracking of various reference trajectories demonstrate the validity of the proposed RNTSMC for practical TAMB applications.},

abstract={See-and-avoid is the current FAA approved method for pilots to avoid objects and other aircraft while flying in visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Although fully autonomous “sense-and-avoid” or “detect-and-avoid” systems are in development, none are currently certified. Thus existing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations are limited to case-by-case restricted airspace or require escort by manned aircraft. Many UAVs are equipped with at least a forward-looking camera. In the transition between current technology and future fully autonomous, certified sense-and-avoid systems, it seems reasonable to require a ground-based operator to perform the see-and-avoid function. This discusses the flight-testing performed to establish air traffic detection ranges for low-time pilots, and for a low-cost UAV camera system. The system was evaluated to determine if it could provide the equivalent see-and-avoid performance as the tested pilots.},

abstract={To establish a method for determination of lead in lipstick with microwave digestion and FAAS. Microwave digestion of samples with selected digestion conditions and FAAS were used to determine Pb in 10 lipstick samples. In the system of nitric acid (7.5 ml) and hydrogen peroxide (1.5ml), the time of microwave digestion was 10 minutes; a better result of digestion was obtained. The linear range and the detection limit of this method was 0.003 mg/l and 0.9994 respectively. The recovery rates of this method were 94.6%~102.5%. This method is satisfied for determination of lead in lipstick samples.},

abstract={In this paper, an analysis of the performance of the OFDM version of the IEEE 802.16e standard is provided in a realistic airport scenario. We implemented a novel stochastic airport channel model describing the main wireless propagation phenomena related to the airport environment. Multi-path and Doppler effects with the potentially resulting inter-symbol interference and inter-carrier interference have been taken into account, respectively. System performance is evaluated for the forward link case in the apron, parking, taxi and runway scenarios, showing strengths and lacks of the system characteristics. For the most critical scenario (i.e., the parking one), an investigation of the reduction of the pilot sub-carriers spacing and on the introduction of antenna diversity is proposed, showing large performance gains.},

At its simplest level, NextGen revolutionizes the three core functions of the air transportation system: Navigation, Communication, and Surveillance. At the conceptual level, the transformation to NextGen yields an ever greater level of Air-Ground (A-G) integration fused with advanced automation. This transformation provides the foundation for migration from today's Air Traffic Control system to Air Traffic Management based on Performance Based Operations (PBO).

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is considering the use of the 5091-5150 MHz subband for the future Airport Network and Location Equipment (ANLE) system. The same frequency band has also been allocated, on a co-primary basis, to mobile-satellite-service (MSS) feeder uplinks. ANLE is visualized as a high-data-rate wireless broadband network for the airport surface environment. An ANLE network architecture using the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) implementation described in the IEEE 802.16 family of standards is assumed in this paper. This analysis considers interference effects from multiple ANLE base stations (BSs) at the same airport, evaluates interference to MSS satellite receivers from ANLE networks with sectorized BSs, and includes the effects of multiple simultaneous OFDMA transmissions. Our results show that, given the parameters identified in the paper for ANLE networks and for MSS feeder uplinks, bandsharing is feasible between these systems.},

abstract={EUROCAE working group (WG) 67 was founded over six years ago. Following the path to a converged telecommunications network carrying IP-only traffic for data as well as voice communications emerged the reality of an international standard for Voice over IP for the ATC environment. The EUROCAE WG-67 born in a coordinated effort among RTCA and EUROCAE mastered its first milestone in 2004 in the Vienna agreement, where international ANSPs, under the auspices of FAA and Eurocontrol agreed on a first set of terminologies and interface control document to be generated. In 2009 the standards for radio communications, ground-ground communications among ATC centers, as well as requirements for the underlying telecommunications infrastructure have been agreed upon by Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) in Europe, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and industry and were issued as a series of ED recommendation documents ED 136 to ED 139. Starting in 2008 interoperability tests as well as international field trials were performed and substantiated the maturity and validity of the standards. The paper addresses the applicability of the WG-67 standards to the National Air Space (NAS). It further addresses the impact on the next generation ATC programs NEXTGEN and SESAR, the potential for cost savings, and implementation of advanced NEXTGEN concept of operations such as Dynamic Resectorization. Finally an outlook is given at the roadmap for the WG-67 VoIP standards to be adopted by ICAO.},

pages={B2-1-B2-7},
abstract={Q routes are en route airway routes, between FL180 and FL450, which can be flown by RNAV equipped aircraft capable of conforming to navigation specified by RNAV 2. Q routes, in use since late 2003, provide more direct routing compared to conventional routes, and are intended to reduce flight distance and travel time. This paper analyzes the benefits of Q routes by comparing the flight performances along select origin destination (OD) pairs, for first quarter of 2003 and first quarter of 2009. The flight performance is measured by: Distance Flown and Travel Time. The two metrics are computed using flight position updates, for the flight en route phase and for the entire flight leg. The results indicate that the flight en route performance was statistically improved on Q routes than conventional airway routes in terms of mean Distance Flown (e.g. +4% for Q Route 1) and mean Travel Time (e.g. +5% for Q Route 1). The flight leg performance was statistically improved on Q routes than conventional airway routes in terms of mean in Distance Flown (e.g. +1.2 % for Q Route 3) and mean Travel Time (e.g. +2% for Q Route 3). These results provide useful criteria for future airspace design.},

pages={A3-1-A3-8},
abstract={The FAA planned Data Communications Network Service (DCNS) will enable digital air/ground (A/G) communication between Air Traffic Control (ATC) facilities and VHF Digital Link (VDL) Mode 2 (VDL-2) equipped aircraft. In successive program segments, ATC services will evolve to include both 'essential' and 'safety critical' applications. Appropriate requirements will be imposed on the DCNS to transport these applications. These requirements will place challenging demands on the performance of the VDL-2 A/G links. Predicting and accommodating the impairments to the air-ground radio channel are necessary for the DCNS provider to deploy a design that assures endto-end performance requirements are satisfied. Good engineering practice requires the characterization of the air-ground radio channel and development of detailed link budgets. Certain significant VDL-2 channel impairments are intermittent (temporal) and add complexity to the analysis. A significant intermittent impairment to VDL-2 uplink messaging can occur while airborne VHF radio systems, such as those used for ATC and Airline Operational Control (AOC) voice communications, are transmitting on their respective downlinks. Another intermittent VDL-2 impairment may occur with VDL-2 transmissions from "hidden terminal" aircraft within radio line of sight of each other, but not communicating with the same ground station. This may happen when aircraft in different service volume 'cells' share the same channel frequency. The impairment occurs when a hidden terminal transmission is received at the victim aircraft with sufficient signal strength. A DCNS A/G subnetwork design analysis and its associated radio channel models should take into consideration any significant intermittent impairment. The interference impairments just described add to the noise calculations in a link budget model. For the uplink VDL-2 channel on the aircraft, the link noise plus interference can cause significant impairment of the channel. This paper develops a framework to predict the coincidence of intermittent impairments with VDL-2 packet reception. The framework is then applied, as example, to the airborne VHF radio cosite problem.},

abstract={As the aviation community moves toward the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), the current Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS II) may become inadequate. This paper describes two types of algorithms that use Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) as the surveillance source for future airborne collision avoidance systems (CASs). The first type, denoted by NextCAS I, estimates the range, range rate, altitude and altitude rate from the ADS-B state vector information but maintains much of the detection and all of the resolution logic structure of the current TCAS. The second type, denoted by NextCAS II, provides a novel approach to detection and resolution of air traffic conflicts in the 3-dimensional (3-D) airspace between two aircraft. The inputs to the detection algorithm are the current 3-D position and speed vector of both aircraft and a cylindrical minimum safety protection zone (PZ) around the conflicting aircraft. For a CAS, the size of the configurable PZ can be assigned values that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) considers as a near mid-air collision (NMAC1) incident. When available, additional inputs, such as measurement uncertainties and intruder type (e.g., manned/unmanned), can be used to alter the default protection zone. The conflict detection takes into account the 3-D encounter (e.g., closure rate, miss distance, relative converging maneuver). The resolution algorithm initially computes a set of six resolution advisories (RAs) and associated resolution alert times that ensure no violation of the protection zone. The six resolutions consist of three sets of two maneuvers related to: ground track (left, right), forward speed (speed up, slow down), and vertical speed (climb, descend). The initial solutions take into account ownship capability (i.e., max climb/descent rate, max turn rate, max speed/stall speed) and ownship pilot response delay (e.g., autonomous vs. manual RA execution). These six solutions are subsequently down-selected in two steps: first, based on the encounter geometry, a single implicitly coordinated, independent solution is selected for each of the three dimensions; then, based on ownship preferences and operational considerations, a final RA solution is selected.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) plays a pivotal role in maintaining security within the National Airspace System (NAS). In particular, high profile events require special airspace security measures to ensure the safety and security of the participants and the venues hosting these events. These events are often designated as National Security Special Events (NSSEs). This paper discusses Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) and other air domain security measures typically employed during NSSEs. Examined are two 2009 NSSEs: the January Presidential Inauguration and the September United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) meeting. Also examined are some of the airspace security incidents that occurred during these events, identified as Tracks of Interest (TOIs). A comparison is also made with incidents measured during several previous NSSEs: the 2007 and 2008 UNGA meetings and the Democratic and Republican National Conventions held during 2008.},

Consequently, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has embarked on a broad-reaching effort called the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) that seeks to transform today's aviation airspace management and ensure increased safety and capacity in ourNAS. The first building block of the NextGen system is the implementation of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) system. One of the most important design aspects of the ADS-B program is the design of the terrestrial radio station infrastructure. This design must determine the layout of the terrestrial radio stations throughout the US optimized to meet system performance, safety and security. Designing this infrastructure to meet all system requirements is at the core of the Service Volume (SV) Engineering. In this paper, we will present the model-based ADS-B SV Engineering design that will be used to capture radio sites layout and configuration parameters. CORE software was selected to implement the model-based SV Engineering environment.},

abstract={Applications requiring frequency agility can benefit from a class of antennas known as frequency agile antennas (FAAs). Such antennas are based on integrating tunable components and/or switches within the structure of the antenna, and show significant promise for use in multi-frequency systems. However, tuning components often have losses associated with them that can affect the performance of an FAA. In this paper, we present the design and analysis of a differentially-fed frequency-tunable patch antenna employing varactor diodes that achieves a 1.8-3.2 GHz frequency tuning range. An equivalent circuit model is developed which is shown to accurately predict both port and radiation characteristics of the antenna. In particular, the ability of the circuit to rapidly and accurately predict the radiation efficiency of FAAs enables particular insight into the effect of tuning component losses to be extracted from the model. Predictions are compared to both full-wave simulations and experimental measurements of an FAA prototype.},

abstract={The Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) has been developed by the FAA to enable precision approach and landing operations using the Global Positioning System (GPS). Each LAAS installation provides services through a LAAS Ground Facility (LGF) which is located at the airport it serves. By monitoring the GPS signals, measurements, and navigation messages, the LGF is able to exclude unhealthy satellites and broadcast real-time range-correction messages for healthy satellites to users via a VHF data link. Airborne users apply these corrections to remove errors that are common between the LGF and the aircraft. The LGF is also responsible for warning the aircraft of any potential integrity threats that cannot easily be resolved by excluding unhealthy satellites. One source of potential errors is the satellite broadcast ephemeris message, which users decode and use to compute GPS satellite positions. In LAAS, potential GPS ephemeris faults are categorized into two types, A and B, based upon whether or not the fault is associated with a satellite maneuver. This work focuses on aviation navigation threats caused by Type A faults. To detect and mitigate these threats, we investigate two LGF monitors based on comparing expected ranges and range rates (based on broadcast ephemeris) with those measured by the LGF. The effectiveness of these monitors is analyzed and verified in this paper.},

abstract={An intelligent complementary sliding-mode control (ICSMC) system using a recurrent wavelet-based Elman neural network (RWENN) estimator is proposed in this study to control the mover position of a linear ultrasonic motors (LUSMs)-based X-Y-Θ motion control stage for the tracking of various contours. By the addition of a complementary generalized error transformation, the complementary sliding-mode control (CSMC) can efficiently reduce the guaranteed ultimate bound of the tracking error by half compared with the sliding-mode control (SMC) while using the saturation function. To estimate a lumped uncertainty on-line and replace the hitting control of the CSMC directly, the RWENN estimator is adopted in the proposed ICSMC system. In the RWENN, each hidden neuron employs a different wavelet function as an activation function to improve both the convergent precision and the convergent time compared with the conventional Elman neural network (ENN). The estimation laws of the RWENN are derived using the Lyapunov stability theorem to train the network parameters on-line. A robust compensator is also proposed to confront the uncertainties including approximation error, optimal parameter vectors, and higher-order terms in Taylor series. Finally, some experimental results of various contours tracking show that the tracking performance of the ICSMC system is significantly improved compared with the SMC and CSMC systems.},

abstract={In the past few years, algebraic attacks against stream ciphers with linear feedback function have been significantly improved. As a response to the new attacks, the notion of algebraic immunity of a Boolean functionfwas introduced, defined as the minimum degree of the annihilators of f and f + 1. An annihilator of f is a nonzero Boolean function g , such that f · g = 0. While several constructions of Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity have been proposed, there is no significant progress concerning the resistance against the so-called fast algebraic attacks. In this paper, we provide a framework to assess the resistance of Boolean functions against the new algebraic attacks, including fast algebraic attacks. The analysis is based on the univariate polynomial representation of Boolean functions and necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for a Boolean function to have optimal behavior against all the new algebraic attacks. Finally, we introduce a new infinite family of balanced Boolean functions described by their univariate polynomial representation. By applying the new framework, we prove that all the members of the family have optimal algebraic immunity and we efficiently evaluate their behavior against fast algebraic attacks.},

abstract={Different hazardous chemicals have been introduced in our environment. Heavy metals, like lead is among those. As the earth approximates that of a closed system, such contaminant will freely distribute itself from one sphere to another at an infinite number of years. Street foods and the raw materials used to prepare it may then be laden with lead. The health and safety of the public is thus at stake particularly if the concentration of lead in food would go beyond the 0.5 ppm EPA standard limit.. According to survey, banana cue, kamote cue, turon, different peanut varieties and kwek were the five most popular street foods from Manila City Hall to Baclaran in Metro Manila, Philippines. Using FAAS, the concentrations of lead in these street foods were obtained and ranged from 0.5667 to 0.7924 ppm. All went above EPA standard limit for lead in food. Lead from combined main and additive raw materials to prepare the different popular street foods, ranged from 0,3266 to 0.7329 ppm. Possible mean lead concentrations in blood upon ingestion of the popular street foods ranged from 17.001 to 39.620 ug/dL The possible blood lead levels went beyond the safe 10ug/dL level set by the Center for Disease Control. Peanuts (with skin) showed the highest lead levels as contributed by the immediate environment. For the recommendations, sample collection schedule must include the start and the end of the selling day of the vendors. Study of the possible sources of lead contamination of raw materials used must be explored. The Philippine Government may use this study as basis for policy making for lead-free street foods and raw materials, and for the improvement of environment and health conditions in Metro Manila.},

abstract={Cheese powder is a kind of nutritional food stuff and flavoring, widely used in food industry. In this paper, mold cheese powder directly made from liquid milk was studied, in which mold and enzymes hydrolysis were combined to speed up the formation of flavor compounds and shorten the production period. In this research, the strains of Actinomucor elegans, Penicillium camemberti and Penicillium roqueforti were investigated to ferment the milk, among which the strain of Actinomucor elegans was indicated to be most effective according to the result of FFA% and FAA% produced in fermentation, which reached 4.28% and 0.37%, respective, when inoculated at the concentration of 1.94×106 cfu/mL and fermented at 29 °C for 4 days. In order to accelerate the flavor formation, the effects of lipase and protease combined hydrolysis was subsequently studied. Through orthogonal experiments, the lipase zymolysis process was confirmed as addition of 2.0%(w/v) lipase and 12%(w/v) fat and kept at 50 °C for 6h, and then added protease 0.15%(w/v) and protein 6%(w/v), at 55 °C for 8h. The spray-drying was carried out at the inlet and outlet temperature of 180-190 °C; and 80-90 °C, respectively, and the input material speed was controlled at the speed of 30mL/min under the pressure of 35Mpa to protect the volatile composition.

abstract={The present paper proposes the application of sodium trititanate whisker as solid sorbent for trace cadmium pre-concentration/separation using a static system coupled with flame atomic adsorption spectrometry (FAAS). The method comprised the pre-concentration of Cd(II) ions at a buffered solution (pH 5.0) onto 0.25 g of sorbent previously activated by 3.0 mol/L of HNO3. The elution step was carried out with 10 ml of 2.0 mol/L of HCl. The effect of the experimental parameters, such as sample pH, amount of sodium trititanate whisker and eluent were studied. Also, the effect of foreign ions on the determination of Cd(II) was also investigated. Under the optimum conditions, the greatest static adsorption capacity of sodium trititanate whisker for Cd(II) was 36.07 mg/g, and lower limit of detections and precision are 0.015 mg/L and 1.31%, respectively.},

abstract={Nowadays, many airports' capacity almost reaches its limitation; some airports begin to build new runway systems to satisfy the demand for air transportation. Choose which operational mode of the new runway system becomes a very tough question. This paper presents closely spaced parallel runway (CSPR) simulation using SIMMOD Plus. Thus, the method can advise the airport managers and air traffic controllers to choose the better model to use and build interrelated equipments. Through simulating the present airspace situation and the future ground situation of CKG airport, the delay which includes the air and ground and travel time statistics is calculated on the base of the SIMMOD Plus. In this paper, we proposed two scenarios: (1). 02L for take-off, 02R for landing; (2). 02L for landing, 02R for take-off; Compare and analyze the two scenarios statistics, we find out 02L for landing, 02R for take-off is the better choice.},

abstract={In large-scale asynchronous distributed virtual environments(DVEs), one of the difficult problems is to deliver the concurrent events in a consistent order at each node. Generally, the previous consistency control approaches can be classified into two categories: causal order and time stamped order. However, causal order approaches can merely preserve the cause-effect relation of events and time stamped order approaches seem intrinsically complex to be used in serverless large-scale asynchronous DVEs. In this paper, we proposed a novel distributed algorithm to identify the concurrent events and preserve the consistent order delivery of them at different nodes. Simulation studies are also carried out to compare the performance of this algorithm with that of the previous ones. The results show that the new algorithm can effectively deliver the concurrent events in consistent order at each node and is more efficient than the previous algorithms in large-scale asynchronous DVEs.},

Prior studies on technology development have described the role of lead users who represent a potentially important source of novel innovations due to their unique knowledge base accumulated through their daily practice. By expanding this concept to service innovation in healthcare, our proposed model identifies a systemic view of innovation defined as a collective, non-deterministic, and path-dependent function of innovation in medical technology as well as the adoption and diffusion of these clinical innovations within a community of practice. We describe this function as a service co-creation function. Our empirical case studies on medical imaging devices support our model and, in turn, bring some insight on innovation management for medical physicians and commercial firms.},

The problem considered concerns the scheduling of the crossing times of a set of aircraft through a metering fix, while maintaining aircraft separation. First, we show how to solve this combined path planning and scheduling problem using mixed-integer geometric programming. Second, the objective function used to determine the aircraft ordering at the fix is not given a priori but needs to be obtained from the airlines, which are strategic profit maximizing agents and could lie about their true cost. In order to realign individual and global objectives, we study the use of the Clarke-Groves mechanism in this context, which aims at extracting the true utility functions from the airlines using side-payments to the FAA.},

First, the dynamics of the field-oriented control PMLSM servo drive with a lumped uncertainty, which contains parameter variations, external disturbances and nonlinear friction force, is derived. Then, to achieve accurate trajectory tracking performance with robustness, an intelligent control approach using FLRBFN is proposed for the field-oriented control PMLSM servo drive system. The proposed FLRBFN is a radial basis function network (RBFN) embedded with a functional link neural network (FLNN). Moreover, the on-line learning algorithm of the FLRBFN, including the connective weights, the centers and the centers' width of the receptive field functions, are derived using back-propagation (BP) method. Furthermore, an FPGA chip is adopted to implement the developed control and on-line learning algorithms for possible low-cost and high-performance industrial applications using PMLSM. Finally, some experimental results are illustrated to show the validity of the proposed control approach.},

We are particularly interested in the case where the user transitions from L1-L5 to having L5-only since the uncertainty of the L5-only ionospheric delay estimation is larger than the case for L1-only. The goal is to provide the techniques necessary for single-frequency users to sustain a performance similar to those of dual-frequency users. The proposed techniques are 1) the code and carrier divergence technique, 2) the WAAS ionosphere threat model technique, and 3) the maximum ionospheric delay gradient model technique. The results show that all three proposed techniques provide good ionospheric delay estimation for the full duration of approach.},

abstract={Among the receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) algorithms treating multiple failures, multiple hypothesis solution separation algorithms (MHSS) - a type of solution separation algorithm - offer several advantages: First, the link between threat model, upper bound on the position error - the protection level and probability of hazardously misleading information is an easy and straightforward one; second, the calculation of the protection level does not involve complex steps. One of the critical steps in this algorithm is the allocation of the integrity and continuity budgets among the failure modes, as it determines the overall performance of the algorithm. After describing the baseline MHSS approach, we present an algorithm that simultaneously allocates the integrity and continuity budget among the failure modes to obtain the minimum protection level per satellite geometry. Then, we show how slope-based RAIM and solution separation RAIM are related through a little-known formula, which both unifies and highlights the differences between the two approaches. Finally, we apply the algorithm to evaluate the performance of RAIM for vertical guidance for a dual constellation, and find that even with a very large prior probability of satellite failure, vertical guidance can be achieved worldwide with high availability.},

The contents of all metals (i.e. chromium, copper, iron, manganese, nickel and zinc) were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (FAAS). Mean concentration (ugg-1dry weight) of metals in edible portion of wild Oreochromis nilotica have been found to be as 93. 306 ±72.14 (Zn), 26.012 ±25.194 (Cu), 31.925 ± 18.935(Ni), while Cr, Mn and Fe were not detected in all fish samples. The relationship between metal concentration and fish size (length and weight) was found non significant, but highly significant correlation was observed between metal concentration and condition factor except zinc. Overall the metal limits set by World Health Organization for human consumption in edible parts of the fish samples do not exceed the actual concentration found in fish samples and so not pose a risk for human health.},

A web-based spatial decision support system, GZ-IGIS, was developed and implemented to integrate domain knowledge and GIS analytical models to assist field-based crop management decision making. In addition to general GIS spatial data management (digital map, spatial decision unit, etc.), the system, GZ-IGIS, involves crop diagnosis and decision-making with expert knowledge and GIS analytical models to assess variable-rate application of water and fertilizer to any field. The paper also discusses the knowledge acquisition and representation, model organization, and the integration of domain knowledge and GIS analytical models. Spatial suitability of domain knowledge and analytical models were emphasized in the system because field's microclimate diversity in different sub-regions exists. When proper layers of knowledge and models become available, implementing variable-rate water, or fertilizer applications allows farmers make reliable site-specific crop management decisions.},

Experiments on two datasets, simple shapes and photographs of coins, show that it is difficult for a Single-Objective GP (SOGP) system (which weights the multiple objectives a priori) to evolve effective object detectors, but that an MOGP system is able to evolve a range of effective object detectors more efficiently.},

abstract={One of the major stakeholders of image fusion is being able to process the most complex images at the finest possible integration level and with the most reliable accuracy. The use of support vector machine (SVM) fusion for the classification of multisensors images representing a complex tropical ecosystem is investigated. First, SVM are trained individually on a set of complementary sources: multispectral, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and a digital elevation model (DEM). Then a SVM-based decision fusion is performed on the three sources. SVM fusion outperforms all monosource classifications outputting results with the same accuracy as the majority of other comparable studies on cultural landscapes. SVM-based hybrid consensus classification does not only balance successful and misclassified results, it also uses misclassification patterns as information. Such a successful approach is partially due to the integration of DEM-extracted indices which are relevant to land cover mapping in non-cultural and topographically complex landscapes.},

abstract={An intelligent integral backstepping sliding mode control (IIBSMC) system using a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) recurrent neural network (RNN) is proposed to control the position of a levitated object of a magnetic levitation system considering the uncertainties in this study. First, the dynamic model of the magnetic levitation system is derived. Then, an integral backstepping sliding mode control (IBSMC) system with an integral action is proposed for the tracking of the reference trajectory. Moreover, to relax the requirements of the needed bounds and discard the switching function in IBSMC, an IIBSMC system using a MIMO RNN estimator is proposed to improve the control performance and further increase the robustness of the magnetic levitation system. The adaptive learning algorithms are derived using Lyapunov stability theorem to train the parameters of the RNN online. Finally, some experimental results of the tracking of periodic sinusoidal trajectory demonstrate the validity of the proposed IIBSMC system for practical applications.},

abstract={Code smells are particular patterns in object-oriented systems that are perceived to lead to difficulties in the maintenance of such systems. It is held that to improve maintainability, code smells should be eliminated by refactoring. It is claimed that classes that are involved in certain code smells are liable to be changed more frequently and have more defects than other classes in the code. We investigated the extent to which this claim is true for God Classes and Brain Classes, with and without normalizing the effects with respect to the class size. We analyzed historical data from 7 to 10 years of the development of three open-source software systems. The results show that God and Brain Classes were changed more frequently and contained more defects than other kinds of class. However, when we normalized the measured effects with respect to size, then God and Brain Classes were less subject to change and had fewer defects than other classes. Hence, under the assumption that God and Brain Classes contain on average as much functionality per line of code as other classes, the presence of God and Brain Classes is not necessarily harmful; in fact, such classes may be an efficient way of organizing code.},

abstract={DHTs have been widely used in designing various applications, especially P2P file sharing systems. It is crucial but difficult to get an accurate snapshot of a DHT network, since such network is serverless and peers join and depart dynamically. In this letter, we analyze and empirically verify that neither breadth-first search nor depth-first search is optimal for DHT snapshot crawling, due to uneven ID distribution of contacts in the routing table of each DHT peer. We then propose a hybrid search strategy which could both start up quickly and slow down slowly. The experiment performed on Mainline shows that this approach significantly outperforms breadth-first or depth-first search strategy.},

abstract={Wireless communication security is addressed using device-specific RF-DNA fingerprints in a localized regional air monitor. The targeted application includes IEEE 802.16 WiMax-based airport communications such as being proposed by the Euro control and FAA organizations-concept validation is currently underway using the Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System (AeroMACS) network. Security enhancement via RF-DNA fingerprinting is motivated by earlier RF-DNA work using GMSK-based intra-cellular GSM signals and OFDM-based 802.11a peer-to-peer WiFi signals. The commonality that WiMax shares with these two existing communication systems, i.e., the cellular control structure of GSM and the multi-carrier OFDM modulation of 802.11a, suggests that RF-DNA fingerprinting may be effective for WiMax device discrimination. This is important given that WiMax shares some common features that may prove detrimental, to include bit-level authentication, privacy, and security mechanisms. It is reasonable to assume that these bit-level mechanisms will come under attack as ``hackers'' apply lessons learned from their previous successes. The contributions of this paper include: 1) the introduction of a Spectral Domain (SD) RF-DNA fingerprinting technique to augment previous Time Domain (TD) and Wavelet Domain (WD) techniques, and 2) a first look at AeroMACS physical waveform features and the potential applicability of RF-DNA fingerprinting using operationally collected signals.},

title={Investigation of Pb dispersal and accumulation around untreated former tin mines in Perak, Malaysia},
year={2010},
volume={},

pages={43-47},
abstract={There are approximately 114 000 ha of former mining area left derelict after the tin mining industry collapsed in Malaysia [1] These lands are currently turned into agriculture and aquaculture farms. Unfortunately, studies have indicated that crops cultivated on tin tailings have been found to contain alarming levels of Potentially Toxic Elements (PTEs). Fish that are bred in slurry ponds and mine pools are also not excluded from PTEs. This research aims to determine and identify the atmospheric dispersal as well as the accumulation of Pb from active and derelict former tin mines in Perak, Malaysia. Samples of plants; Melastoma sp. and Benincasa sp. and fish; Tilapia sp. and Cichla sp. grown and bred in mining ponds were collected from active farms in Location 1 and 2. Plants and fish of the same species and grown naturally were also taken from abandoned mine sites at Location 3 and 4. Atmospheric dispersal of heavy metals is also investigated using available biomarkers. Tree bark from Acacia mangium sp. is collected to represent heavy metal dispersal from wind erosion of tin tailings from the mine sites. The methodology for sample analysis was done by using wet digestion analysis with nitric acid and hydrochloric acid. Concentration of heavy metals was determined using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). Pb concentration was found to be highest in the root of Melastoma sp. at 57.62 mg/kg and in the muscle of Cichla sp. at 27.28 mg/kg. The results indicate elevated Pb levels regardless of whether it is from active or abandoned tin mine site. Heavy metal levels in all of the plants and fish samples in this study were found to be above the safe limit issued in the Food Acts 1983 and Regulations 1985[2][14]. Appropriate measures should be taken to further reduce the dispersal and exposure of heavy metals from the former mine sites from entering into the food chain and causing serious threat towards health and safety.},

This guidance method combines (i) the construction of a principal component analysis (PCA) on spectral bands and gray level co-occurence matrix texture attributes calculated on very high resolution images and (ii) the use of the Sobel's edge detection algorithm on this PCA. The experiment is successfully applied with an overall accuracy of 82 %. Using SVM, a minimum number of mixed pixels is necessary but they can help significantly in locating an appropriate hyperplane. Moreover, the presented results show that the training stage could be more influential on classifier accuracy than classifiers themselves.},

abstract={Research is needed to determine what procedures, aircraft sensors and other systems will be required to allow Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) to safely operate with manned aircraft in the National Airspace System (NAS). The NASA Langley Research Center has transformed a Cirrus Design SR22 general aviation (GA) aircraft into a UAS Surrogate research aircraft to serve as a platform for UAS systems research, development, flight testing and evaluation. The aircraft is manned with a Safety Pilot and systems operator that allows for flight operations almost anywhere in the NAS without the need for a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Certificate of Authorization (COA). The UAS Surrogate can be controlled from a modular, transportable ground station like a true UAS. The UAS Surrogate is able to file and fly in the NAS with normal traffic and is an ideal platform for real world UAS research and development compared to actual UAS flying in restricted ranges or other sterilized airspace. The Cirrus Design SR22 aircraft is a small, single-engine, four-place, composite-construction aircraft that NASA Langley acquired to support NASA flight-research programs like the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) Project. Systems were installed to support flight test research and data gathering. These systems include: separate research power; multi-function flat-panel displays; research computers; research air data and inertial state sensors; video recording; data acquisition; datalink; S-band video and data telemetry; Common Airborne Instrumentation System (CAIS); Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B); instrumented surfaces and controls; and a systems operator work station. The transformation of the SR22 to a UAS Surrogate was accomplished in phases. The first phase was to modify the existing autopilot to accept external commands from a research computer that was connected by redundant data-link radios to a ground control station. An electro-mechanical auto-throttle was added in the next phase to provide ground station control of airspeed. Additional phases are in progress to add waypoint navigation and long range satellite voice and data communications. Potential areas for UAS Surrogate research include the development, flight test and evaluation of sensors to aid in the process of air traffic “detect-sense-and-avoid”. These sensors could be evaluated in real-time and compared with onboard human evaluation pilots. This paper describes the systems and design considerations that were incorporated in the development of the UAS Surrogate along with details of development problems encountered and the corresponding solutions.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has committed to implementing Area Navigation (RNAV) procedures at airports throughout the National Airspace System (NAS). Delta Airlines (DAL) and air traffic controllers from the Atlanta Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) (A80) facility have collaborated to design RNAV Visual Flight Procedures (RVFPs) at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport (ATL). These procedures are comprised of a modified RNAV Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR) runway transition, a Constant Radius to Fix (RF) turn from the downwind to the final approach course, and the existing RNAV Global Positioning System (GPS) approach procedure. The RVFPs are designed to increase efficiency of properly-equipped ATL arrivals in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). Implementing new RNAV procedures requires consideration of current traffic patterns to ensure a more efficient operation while maintaining high levels of operational safety. A80 requested that The MITRE Corporation's Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD) conduct a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) simulation to evaluate the operational acceptability of implementing the proposed procedures from the pilot and controller perspectives. The HITL simulation allowed participants to identify design and procedural issues that required change. These changes were implemented during the course of the HITL simulation, yielding a procedure acceptable to both pilots and controllers.},

abstract={Ongoing monitoring of safety critical systems is an important means of ensuring that system performance meets requirements and facilitating proactive identification and resolution of potential problems. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recently implemented one such effort, the TCAS Operational Performance Assessment (TOPA) program. This program records automatic downlinks of all TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA) events within sensor coverage and correlates the RAs with surveillance data, calculates performance parameters and permanently stores the data for future analysis. Periodic and focused reports are prepared based on these data. This paper summarizes key analyses of over 15,000 TCAS RAs collected in the period April - September 2009 at 5 major terminal areas in the U.S. National Airspace (NAS). Most RAs occurred below 5,000' in Class E airspace and involved low performance General Aviation (GA) intruders. Although no significant issues were observed with the performance of TCAS logic, the analysis showed that pilot compliance with Climb and Descend RAs did not meet system design assumptions. These results indicate that pilot training and the design of future systems must explicitly consider these factors.},

abstract={The differences in performance of various manufacturers' Flight Management Systems (FMSs) and their associated Flight Management Computers (FMCs) have the potential for significant operational impact on the air traffic control system and as such need to be examined on a recurring basis. Performance-based navigation (PBN) is a fundamental principle for aircraft operations that will facilitate the transition to future airspace systems. A critical element of PBN is the FMS's capability to fly a consistently repeatable and predictable flight path trajectory that will meet the expectations of air traffic control. FMS manufacturers build their systems in accordance with and for area navigation systems, Technical Standard Orders and Advisory Circulars. Area Navigation (RNAV) and Required Navigation Performance (RNP) procedures and routes are published by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) according to criteria contained in FAA orders. It is anticipated that the resulting performance of the aircraft FMC will meet the procedure design requirements identified in the FAA criteria. Sometimes, due to the nearly independent development of procedure design criteria and aircraft performance standards, the paths of various aircraft on the same procedure do not coincide and therefore do not match the expectations of the procedure designer. These differences may result from any or all of the following: variations in FMC equipment installed on the aircraft; variations and errors in procedure coding in the FMC navigation database; variations in aircraft-to-FMC interface and associated aircraft performance capabilities; and variations in flight crew training and procedures. The hypothesis of this paper is that the FMCs built by avionics manufacturers and installed as the core of the FMC/FMS combinations in various airframe platforms perform differently and we will attempt to quantify those differences. This paper focuses on FMC performance when flying Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs) and their associated waypoints and leg types (path terminators) and combinations as described in. Public instrument procedures flown using RNAV equipment are used as the baseline for measuring the performance variations. Controlled field observations trials were made using twelve FMS test benches and three simulators at seven major FMC manufacturers and two airlines. Analysis of data from the trials confirms differences and the details are presented. The intent of this report is to contribute technical data as a foundation for the acceptance of required navigation performance (RNP) departures.},

abstract={The demand for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) access to the National Airspace System (NAS) is increasing as agencies find more ways to use them to complete their missions. The Department of Defense (DoD) flies UASs in the NAS primarily for training and some operational missions, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) flies UASs in the NAS for scientific missions, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) flies UASs in the NAS to patrol our borders. These are some of the uses of UASs that are currently being operated by public entities. Many of the UASs that operate in the NAS are flying in airspace controlled by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic controllers and, because of their unique operating characteristics and procedures, have an impact on those controllers' abilities to safely manage the airspace for which they are responsible. This human-in-the-loop (HITL)1 simulation looked specifically at the lost command and control (C2) link procedures of UASs and how those procedures affected the controllers' abilities to manage the traffic within busy airspace when lost C2 link events were occurring. The study focused on two key aspects of the lost C2 link. First, it analyzed the time it took controllers to identify that a lost C2 link had occurred. Second, it analyzed the time period between the initial indications of a lost C2 link and the initiation of a contingency procedure. The study found that most controllers recognized a lost C2 link situation within a minute of the indication. The study also found that controllers experienced a reduced workload when the time between the notification of the lost C2 link and the aircraft maneuvering was approximately one minute. Additional research is needed to further validate these initial findings. In general, such analytic results need to be taken into account when standardized lost C2 link and other contingency procedures are developed so as to not overload the controllers who are working the airspace in which the UASs are flying.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Surveillance and Broadcast Services (SBS) Program Office has implemented one of the first enablers of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) by installing a ground infrastructure that supports the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data service. One of the main applications for this infrastructure is to enhance air traffic control (ATC) separation through more frequent and accurate data about aircraft. As part of the initial assessment activities, the ADS-B data was incorporated into four different automation platforms in four different key sites. One of these key sites was the Philadelphia Terminal Radar Approach Control (PHL TRACON) which uses Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) to process and display radar data to controllers. The Philadelphia STARS was updated to accept ADS-B data in its native format. Beyond just accepting new surveillance data, however, PHL TRACON is the first location that went operational where ATC used system track positions (so called- “fused” targets) published to the ATC display to allow controllers to separate aircraft, a paradigm shift from current operations where controllers use radar “plot” positions. As part of the SBS evaluation, a working group was created that worked specifically to evaluate the end-end performance of separation services with the new data flow - ADS-B avionics, ADS-B surveillance service on the ground, and the updated STARS software. The evaluation used a comparative approach with current monopulse secondary surveillance radar (MSSR) systems as a baseline; if the new system performed as good or better than MSSR systems in separation applications, then the system was acceptable for operation. This paper describes the efforts of the SBS working group to evaluate the operational performance in Philadelphia, including the metrics used, assumptions made operational scenario development, and results from several analyses, including simulation, flight testing, and targets of opportunity operating in the TRACON airspace.},

volume={},

pages={1.E.3-1-1.E.3-12},
abstract={This paper describes operational concept options for 4D trajectory-based arrival management in the terminal area, using Flight Management Systems (FMS) capable of Area Navigation (RNAV), Required Navigation Performance (RNP), Vertical Navigation (VNAV), as well as Required Time of Arrival (RTA) and airplane-based Interval Management (IM). Furthermore, it is assumed that the ATM automation system provides support to the controller to enable the airplane to fully utilize the above capabilities while maximizing the throughput of a large airport. The paper assumes an arrival management process that is consistent with the current FAA automation architecture for Time-Based Metering, and with the capabilities of the NASA Center-TRACON Automation System (CTAS), i.e. the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) and Efficient Descent Advisor (EDA). The paper refers to the use of these particular capabilities, but many other similar capabilities are already in use or under development across the ATM industry. The paper also assumes the use of an automation capability for efficient operations through the TRACON that supports the airplane capabilities described above. The capability considered in this paper is based on the Relative Position Indicator (RPI) developed by MITRE CAASD, which is scheduled for demonstration in selected FAA TRACON facilities in 2010. The paper discusses the RPI concept in the context of other concepts that involve RNAV/RNP, RTA and IM capabilities. An analysis of the technical performance of these arrival management concepts using the Boeing Trajectory Analysis and Modeling Environment (TAME) is presented. The paper describes how the authors chose to represent the potential application of the RPI in a fast-time simulation of the Denver TRACON airspace. The results show the influence of speed control strategies and scenario design on spacing performance and runway delivery accuracy.},

abstract={This paper describes the Collaborative Departure Queue Management (CDQM) concept, which has been developed by Mosaic ATM under funding from the FAA's Surface Trajectory Based Operations (STBO) project and NASA. Under CDQM procedures, airport departure capacity is allocated to flight operators and metering procedures are used to manage the length of the runway queue. This management of the runway departure queue allows fuel burn, emissions and airport surface congestion to be reduced. Operational field evaluations of CDQM have been conducted over the last year at the Memphis International Airport. This paper provides initial results of these CDQM field evaluations.},

abstract={Experience is not what happens to a man. It is what a man does with what happens to him.” - Aldous Huxley. With this concept in mind, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) team researched and reviewed over 20 Lessons Learned (LL) websites and Interview Lessons Learned leaders of about 10 Federal agencies prior to the development of a LL program. Based on the information gathered, a minipilot program was conducted that tested the acceptability and receptiveness of the program by agency personnel. At present, the LL website has evolved into a Distance e-Learning program based on an user-friend database that includes reference links and navigation tutorials; it is actively managed and captures the successful and not-so-successful experiences that represent a cross-section of FAA programs. The LL committee continues to establish field presence and a community of practice. The ultimate program goal is to develop best practices directly applicable to the FAA based on a combination of external best practices and internal relevant LL articles.},

abstract={Contents of colloidal trace metals(1kD~1μm) in Meiliang Bay, an algal-bloom bay of Taihu Lake, and Gonghu Bay, a macrophytes dominanted bay of Taihu Lake, were investigated in April by using cross-flow ultrafiltration (CFF) technique. In each sampling site, 20 L surface water was pumped and filtrated by 63 μm nylon sieve. The filtered water was carried to laboratory in 2 hours, prefiltrated by 1μm Millipore membrane, and ultrafiltrated by CFF to obtain colloidal concentrated solution. Contents of Fe, Mn and Zn in the pre-filtrated water, colloidal concentrated solution and ultrafiltrate were measured by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer (FAAS) after digestion with HNO3 and HClO4 mixture solution. Contents of Cd, Cu and Pb were measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer (GFAAS). Results showed that contents of colloidal trace metals in Taihu Lake were 0.46~0.86 μg/L (22.3% of the totally dissolved partition) for Cu, 2.06~8.24 μg/L (26.3%) for Zn, 2.62~3.70 μg/L (20.7%) for Pb, 3.48~24.79 μg/L (58.9%) for Fe, 0.31~1.62 μg/L (40.4%) for Mn, and 6.71~17.94 ng/L (59.2%) for Cd. And averagely, the colloidal Cu, Pb, Fe, Mn, and Cd occupied 17.4%, 19.1%, 55.1%, 1.98%, and 52.8% of each total contents in lake water respectively. These indicated that the colloidal material in Taihu Lake was an important factor influencing the biogeochemical cycling of trace metals. Furthermore, except for Cd, average contents of colloidal Cu, Zn, Pb, Fe, and Mn in Meiliang Bay were all higher than those in Gonghu Bay. Contents of colloidal trace metals in Taihu Lake were higher than those in coastal oceans, shorter rivers, and lagoons, which may be mainly due to the higher colloidal content and the stronger affinity of colloids with trace metals in Taihu Lake, but were lower than those in longer rivers such as Namoi river in Australia possibly because of its smaller quality of colloids compared with that in Namoi river. It was also suggested that contents of colloidal trace metals largely depended on contents of colloids in natural water bodies.},

title={Polynomial-Time Feasibility Condition for Multiclass Aircraft Sequencing on a Single-Runway Airport},
year={2011},
volume={12},
number={1},
pages={2-14},
abstract={In this paper, we consider the airport-landing problem of scheduling different types of aircraft on a single runway. Since the minimum allowable landing separation time between two consecutive aircraft depends on the relative weight of both aircraft, this is a state-dependent scheduling problem, which, in the general case, is NP-hard. We attempt to modify the aircraft landing sequence from the traditionally used “first-come-first-served” (FCFS) order to be able to land more aircraft in a given period of time. Given a set of planes, the goal is to find a sequence such that no plane can land before it is actually available for landing, the minimum safety separation between two consecutive planes is always satisfied, and the total landing time (makespan) is minimized. Based on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) partition of aircraft into weight categories, our algorithm provides a polynomial-time feasibility condition for scheduling a set of planes in a given time interval. It ensures that the Aircraft Scheduling Problem (ASP) presented earlier is not NP-complete and allows us to develop possible practical real-time air traffic control (ATC) execution policies.},

abstract={In this paper, a method to calculate alerting thresholds is outlined along with the assumptions and an example. First, the definitions and recommendations of the FAA sponsored Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) workshop report has been adapted to a formal mathematical definition. These definitions are then realized using assumptions and other logic and are translated into a more concrete SAA scenarios. Alerting threshold is first calculated as a range-based specification and then translated into a time-based specification using time to closest point of approach (CPA). It is shown that both, range and time based thresholds can serve important roles in the development of a SAA systems as well as development of the minimum performance standards for SAA. The range-based threshold can be used to define the baseline sensor specification and the time-based threshold can be used as the minimum CPA for collision avoidance. An example of calculating collision avoidance threshold (CAT) for level-turn maneuvers of the unmanned aircraft (UA) is presented along with the results.},

abstract={This work discusses the adaptation of group-oriented messaging and chat technology for operation in serverless, multicast-capable mobile wireless architectures. The main goals are to allow group messaging and chat sessions to fragment/coalesce, operate through disrupted TCP conditions, and improve bandwidth utilization when multicast is available. In addition, the solution demonstrates proxying and gateway methods to interoperate with existing client and server standards and software. The approach presents several innovations that extend and adapt extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) standards for incorporating group serverless chat and messaging within more challenging operational environments. While there is large body of work on messaging middleware solutions, this paper concentrates on the adaptation of specific XMPP standards for serverless, multicast operation. We discuss our working implementation prototype and present initial experimentation comparing client/server multi-user chat (MUC) operation to serverless multicast MUC within several mobile network scenarios. In addition, we demonstrate a gatewaying solution for serverless MUC systems to interoperate with conventional MUC server-based systems. The specific test scenarios are instrumented to operate within a wireless mobile emulation environment using mobile ad hoc network (MANET) unicast and multicast routing technology. This approach remains independent of any particular routing algorithm and the proxied XMPP protocol module allows for the deployment of existing real-world client software across all nodes of the network. The initial findings show the significant performance potential for serverless MUC extensions. In addition to these results, we discuss some ongoing design challenges and future planned work.},

abstract={The local area augmentation system (LAAS) is a proposed satellite-based landing system by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to serve as a navigation aid for commercial aircraft during the approach and landing phase of flight. The LAAS utilizes a special ground-based antenna array called the multipath limiting antenna (MLA) to provide differentially corrected global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data to oncoming aircraft as well as to reduce the largest error contributor to pseudo-range estimates; the ground multipath. The performance of the MLA is characterized in terms of its desired-to-undesired (D/U) gain ratio, phase center variation (PCV) and group delay (GD). A high fidelity antenna model (HFAM) of the MLA is presented that estimates the D/U, PCV, and GD as a function of elevation angle. The model consists of two main components: (1) a microwave feed distribution circuit model created using a circuit simulator, and (2) a radiating structure model developed using a full-wave method of moments (MoM) field solver. The performance of the model was assessed against antenna range measurements. The results of the HFAM show good correlation for the D/U and PCV while a significant bias was observed on the results for the GD. The dependence of the GD on the radiating element's impedance, tuning process, and Doppler frequency shift are demonstrated via simulations.},

This system can be applied as a stand-alone power supply system or as the emergency power system when the electricity grid fails for all sub-synchronous, synchronous and super-synchronous conditions. The rotor side converter is controlled using the field-oriented control to produce three-phase stator voltages with constant magnitude and frequency at different rotor speeds. Moreover, the stator side converter, which is also controlled using field-oriented control, is primarily implemented to maintain the magnitude of the DC-link voltage. Furthermore, the intelligent PIDNN controller is proposed for both the rotor and stator side converters to improve the transient and steady-state responses of the DFIG system for different operating conditions. Both the network structure and on-line learning algorithm are introduced in detail. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed control scheme is verified through experimentation.},

abstract={Low voltage power distribution lines can be developed by the expansion of cities. If location of voltage drop and power outage in distribution networks can't be identified quickly, it can cause high costs for utilization. Research and Development Unit of North Khorasan electric distribution company (NKEDC) has designed a system to perform identification of location of power outage rapidly. In this plan, voltage sensors place at the end of distribution lines and power outage location can be identified through monitoring in electric incidents center. As a result, operations teams will set out to the specified location quickly and solve problem. The difference between this project and previous projects is that the sensor locations in our project are at the end of distribution line. In this paper, we seek to present PO-VDAS with installed electronic sensors at the end of LV distribution.},

abstract={Electric Vehicles (EV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) have a limited share of the current market. However, it is widely expected that the situation will change in the near future and the penetration of battery-operated vehicles will increase significantly. This paper addresses the impact of the mass operation and electricity consumption of EVs and PHEVs on the distribution utility and more specifically on distribution transformers. The charging effect of various types of EV batteries on the life of distribution transformers is analyzed. A typical annual base-load on the distribution transformer is considered and compared with different battery charging load scenarios. Simulation results show that distributing the load profile of the battery charging helps to decrease the distribution transformer loss of life. In addition, power management of the EV and PHEV battery charging and the interface with the Smart-Grid is explained.},

abstract={The modernization of the nation's air transportation system is necessary to accommodate forecasted traffic growth while ensuring safety. The National Airspace System (NAS) capacity is constrained by airport arrival and departure rate limitations due to factors such as weather delays, airline schedule conflicts, and aging infrastructures. New technologies such as data link messaging between ground-based air traffic management systems, tower controllers and flight decks, controller surface decision support tools, and cockpit digital maps are being developed to meet airport capacity upgrade needs. The benefits sought by data link are to reduce the need for voice communications between the pilot and controller, lower the likelihood of pilot readback and controller hearback errors, which, in turn, should reduce operator workload. The benefits sought by the surface management tools are to provide more optimized taxi routes, taxi conformance monitoring, and departure scheduling; which, in turn, will increase take-off capacity while reducing fuel, noise and environmental impacts. The data link messages are planned to cover all aspects of the taxi-out and taxi-in operations. However, for safety reasons, tactical process steps (e.g. runway crossing clearances) will still be issued verbally by the controllers. Data link messages are planned to eventually become the predominant mode of communication between controllers and pilots, but will still be supplemented by voice-based instructions as well as the use of paper-based airport maps. The transition to data link operations will impact how pilots and controllers communicate and share common and synchronous situation awareness (SA). The user interface design and operational procedure requirements to ensure that the desired safety and efficiency benefits still need definition. The paper provides a summary of past research activities and highlights unresolved research issues related to the implementation of data link taxi messaging within an integrated air-ground surface traffic management system.},

abstract={An open question in Air Traffic Management is what procedures can be validated by simulation where the simulation shows that the probability of undesirable events is below the required level at some confidence level. The problem is including enough realism to be convincing while retaining enough efficiency to run the large number of trials needed for high confidence. The paper first examines the probabilistic interpretation of a typical requirement by a regulatory agency and computes the number of trials needed to establish the requirement at an equivalent confidence level. Since any simulation is likely to consider only one type of event and there are several types of events, the paper examines under what conditions this separate consideration is valid. This paper establishes a separation algorithm at the required confidence level where the aircraft operates under feedback control as is subject to perturbations. There is a discussion where it is shown that a scenario three to four orders of magnitude more complex is feasible. The question of what can be validated by simulation remains open, but there is reason to be optimistic.},

abstract={(TCAS) Traffic collision avoidance system) is a technique used to reduce mid -air collision. It was developed by the Federal aviation administration (FAA), civil aviation authorities (CAA) and the aviation industry. However past analysis shows that there are late reactions or human errors such as over reactions from pilot's which may lead to flight crash or injuries to passengers. There may also be a lack of communication between (ATC) and crew when a resolution advisories (RA) occurs. In this paper, we propose a autopilot configured TCAS that would help to reduce mid air collisions. This can be done using a MSP-430(DSP Microcontroller) that takes coordinates from transponders, and judge any critical scenario based on the GLARE algorithm and shift to autopilot mode until the aircraft reaches a safe zone. Whenever a (TA) occurs the control shifts to longitudinal autopilot mode until the aircraft reaches a safe position; then shifts back to pilot mode. This prevents the pilot from taking control whenever a TA occurs, thus preventing human effort.},

abstract={A digital signal processor (DSP)-based cross-coupled intelligent complementary sliding mode control (ICSMC) system is proposed in this paper for the synchronous control of a dual linear motor servo system. The dual linear motor servo system with two parallel permanent magnet linear synchronous motors is installed in a gantry position stage. The dynamic model of single-axis motion control system with a lumped uncertainty, which comprises parameter variations, external disturbances, and nonlinear friction force, is introduced first. Then, to achieve an accurate trajectory tracking performance with robustness, a cross-coupled ICSMC is developed. In this approach, a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang-type fuzzy neural network estimator with accurate approximation capability is implemented to estimate the lumped uncertainty. Moreover, since a cross-coupled technology is incorporated into the proposed intelligent control scheme for the gantry position stage, both the position tracking and synchronous errors of the dual linear motors will simultaneously converge to zero. Furthermore, to effectively demonstrate the control performance of the proposed intelligent control approach, a 32-b floating-point DSP-based control computer is developed for the implementation of the proposed cross-coupled ICSMC system. Finally, some experimental results are illustrated to show the validity of the proposed control approach.},

abstract={Researchers involved directly with the security of information-processing systems know that many such systems do not have the levels of integrity and sustainability that are much more prevalent for safety-critical systems. Safety-critical systems, many of which are industrial process control systems, are generally built and tested to much higher standards for handling system failure or aberrant behavior than is typical for even mission-critical information-processing systems. There is a long history of stringent standards for creating, running and sustaining safety-critical systems, particularly avionics, military systems, and the like. For example, international standard DO-178B, which was developed specifically for avionics but has been adopted by other fields, is acknowledged by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) as a certification standard for avionics software. Also, NIST's Special Publication 800-82 “Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security” provides guidance as to securing “Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, Distributed Control Systems (DCS), and other control system configurations such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC).” In the U.S. government, the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) defines security objectives for information and information systems according to the traditional triad of confidentiality, integrity and availability. FISMA defines three levels of potential impact - low, moderate, high - on organizations or individuals were a security breach to occur. Many private-sector organizations do in fact categorize information processing systems according to business criticality. Certain key sectors, such as financial services, are obliged to classify systems as critical in order to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. For key critical operations, systems must incorporate sufficient resiliency so as to mitigate the risk of failure. Usually criticality falls into one of three categories, namely, based on regulatory requirements or guidelines, business continuity, or class of information held, such as nonpublic personal information, and processed within the system. In this paper we examine systems across the full spectrum of criticality, from non-critical, through security-critical and safety-critical systems, in terms of how they are engineered,. That is, we look at the processes by which they are designed, built, deployed, operated, modified and decommissioned. We also discuss how mission-criticality affects the requisite level of assurance. Finally, we describe how some of the demanding methods used to strengthen safety-critical systems, which are expected to exhibit high levels of assurance and integrity, might be adapted to the engineering of security-critical information systems.},

Seeking to define a future communication system suitable for planned air-to-air and air-to-ground ATM operations, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and EUROCONTROL initiated a joint study in the frame of Action Plan 17 (AP17) to investigate suitable technologies and provide recommendations to the ICAO ACP Working Group T. Two proposals for the L-band Digital Aeronautical Communication System (L-DACS) were elaborated. This paper discusses the L-DACS1 proposal, a multi-application broadband system capable of simultaneously supporting various kinds of air-to-air and air-to-ground Air Traffic Services (ATS) and Airline Operational Communications (AOC) data link services. This paper presents the research towards the design and the performance evaluation of the proposed medium access control sub-layer and logical link control sublayer of the L-DACS1 air-to-air protocol stack. The L-DACS1 air-to-air protocol has been designed for the periodic transmission of air-to-air surveillance data while supporting the transmission of a low volume of non-periodic addressed air-to-air messages. It tries to achieve this objective via a self-adaptive slotted TDMA protocol.},

Iris aims at designing, developing and validating a new system for air-ground safety communications within the framework of the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) Programme, to enable operational use by 2020. The system design studies are progressing in an iterative process with projects of SESAR Joint Undertaking. Overall, the general source of requirements for applications and communication performance is the FAA/Eurocontrol COCR v2 document, but several system-level requirements are not defined yet. User requirements are being defined by SESAR JU but some of them require a better understanding of their impact on the system design before a consolidation can take place. To this end, ESA studies have been analyzing the range of options for user requirements defined by aviation, and deduced the requirements for the user terminals, the characteristics required of the communication protocols, the link budget and, consequently, determined the requirements for the space segment and the ground segment. To cope with the uncertainties linked to the future operational concept and implementation of it, variation and combination of the user requirements is considered for defining “requirements options” that are further assessed and traded-off. The present Paper provides the latest results of the analysis of these requirements options, focusing on their consequences on the system design.},

year={2011},

pages={B6-1-B6-10},
abstract={Satellite based voice communication services today are typically provided by communication centers interconnecting ground based communication facilities with suitably equipped aircrafts. These communication services are either based on a radio operator relaying the radio calls or by connecting the call automatically to phone lines through a telephone gateway. Calls from ground parties to aircraft typically use telephone numbers on a private telephone network in order to reach the appropriate air-to-ground relay station, which in turn patches the call into the radio call to the aircraft, or v ia a dispatcher in a communication center. Common for these satellite based services is the fact that only a single aircraft is addressed. Further, there is no relation between boundaries controlled by Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), or any other responsible agency and the coverage of a satellite beam. This is a clear disadvantage over conventional Air Traffic Management (ATM) voice communications performed via VHF radio. Situational awareness is key for the decision making process of controllers and pilots in the next generation airspace system (NEXTGEN). In VHF radio communications this awareness is automatically provided by the shared-media nature of the air waves, thus allowing commands from controllers and the corresponding read-back from pilots to be received by all listeners on a particular frequency simultaneously (propagation delay of the radio signal not considered). In addition, today's sector boundaries (horizontal and vertical) are based on traffic patterns and thus are in accordance with the major air traffic routes, where it never happens, that a single sector requires a handover between two different radio channels (i.e. different physical frequencies). We describe mechanisms that allow combining aircrafts to virtual sector groups independent of satellite beam coverage and introduce communication services by considering technical issues of satellite based communications. Aspects of NEXTGEN are addressed such as capacity, performance, and global coverage. ANSPs, FAA, Eurocontrol, and industry are working together to define IP as the next generation common network layer for voice and data communications. EUROCAE Working Group 67 (WG-67) has recently completed its recommendation documents, which are now ready to become ICAO recommendations. To ensure interoperability at the application layer, open standards, a center piece of the internet protocol suite, have been agreed upon by consensus. In addition we elaborate an optimization concept for satellite communication that is in the context of the WG-67 definitions. It takes into account the available data-rate, channel access methods, different end-to-end delay, and more. A translation and optimization entity between the different technologies is introduced providing the WG-67 interface definitions on the ground side and an optimized air-to-ground interface as Link Gateway (LGW). The LGW provides the key communication capabilities to both ends, the ground based voice communications network and the aircraft and handles the interface to the data-link layer (L2) capabilities provided by the data-link via the Ground Earth Station (GES). This allows designing voice communication application services independent of the underlying transport technology. For instance changing or extending the interface at the GES would not affect the Voice Communication System (VCS) or aircraft application, only changes at the LGW are necessary. Another service entity, the Sector Floor Control (SFC) performs floor control and if applicable requests appropriate resources from the GES via the LGW. Finally, we discuss the benefits of future ATM data-link concepts as well as the benefits of integration in a multi-link environment.},

abstract={The IEEE 802.16 standard known as the Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN), which is also commonly referred to as the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) was initially created as a final mile; point-to-point wireless communication protocol known as 802.16(d), or Fixed WiMAX. Further development of the WiMAX standard created a mobile version which is 802.16(e), or Mobile WiMAX. The aeronautical industry is adopting a version of the Mobile WiMAX 802.16(e)-2009 standard known as the Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System (AeroMACS). The goal of AeroMACS is to create a broadband wireless network with the ability to transfer data between fixed and mobile assets on the airport surface. Aircraft, air traffic control (ATC), airlines, ground crews and other stakeholders on the airport surface are examples of the intended end users of the AeroMACS network. The need for such a network has been identified by the joint FAA-EUROCONTROL, Future Communications Study (FCS) as documented in the Communications Operating Concept and Requirements (COCR) for the Future Radio System (FRS). One of the goals of the FCS was to determine a possible medium of communication that can augment the current VHF radio based communication system for aircraft and controllers. Some of the data that will be transported over the AeroMACS network is considered critical to flight operations, depending on the data set and which party is providing the data. The guidelines for the utilization of the AeroMACS network are that the data transmitted over the network is necessary for the safety and regularity of flight. Therefore AeroMACS data transmissions must remain secure and reliable so the information provided by AeroMACS can be trusted by industry stakeholders and the FAA. To ensure that the 802.16(e) standard will be able to provide a secure and reliable means of wireless communication, it is important to analyze the network security protocol. In doing so, we will be able to identify any potential weaknesses in the network security protocol, allowing us to find ways of mitigating the risk associated with any weaknesses found.},

abstract={The future of information management within the air traffic community is enhanced through sharing of flight data objects, enabled by the System Wide Information Management (SWIM) initiative. SWIM provides the backbone for sharing information throughout the national airspace (NAS), which allows new and existing applications and decision support tools to take advantage of current and consistent data on the SWIM infrastructure, for users to achieve common situational awareness, and systems to make optimum use of the airspace while maintaining safe operations. SWIM-enabling existing and evolving applications and decision support tools lowers the FAA's long-term maintenance costs by transitioning from point-to-point legacy interfaces to use of SWIM for information sharing. The SWIM initiative is aligned with the principles of Service-oriented architecture (SOA). En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) is operational in Salt Lake and Seattle centers and is proceeding through site deployment for the other 18 centers. One of the significant enhancements to the baseline ERAM is the addition of the first SWIM-enabled service, the Flight Information Service (FIS). The initial version of FIS provides for processing of Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS)-initiated pre-departure re-route amendments. Enhancements to the initial FIS design position it for use by other consumers for an overall life cycle cost savings. The potential uses of ERAM-provided SWIM services are numerous including modernization of existing legacy interfaces (such as Host-ATM Data Distribution System - HADDS and Flight Data Input/Output - FDIO), and the addition of new users as part of development of new applications. One potential new user, the Data Communications Air Traffic Control Facilities Notification (AFN) Accelerated Departure Clearance Service (DCL) involves several systems in achieving the end-to-end thread. FIS can accept and process updates from consumers and publish the existing ERAM flight data to authorized users, and address the specific needs of tower systems to automatically send accelerated departure clearances to aircraft. ERAM enhancements can also allow aircraft to log on as FANS aircraft, and then allow a ground station (Tower Data Link Services, TDLS) to establish controller pilot data link communication (CPDLC) sessions to exchange text from air traffic control (ATC) systems to the airplane's cockpit.},

abstract={This paper describes the work that was done by Boeing Advanced Air Traffic Management (AATM), Boeing Research & Technology Europe (BR&TE), Selex Sistemi Integrati, and Boeing Networked Systems Technology (NST) on the European Commission SWIM-SUIT Interoperability project. This work was sponsored by the European Commission and the US FAA. The goal of this project was the implementation and demonstration of SOA compliant mediation and distribution services for the exchange of live surveillance, flight plans, and flight objects between US and European aviation systems. The mediation service provided transformation between flight data defined by ASDI, ERAM and ICOG schemas. The Surveillance data was represented using FAA and Eurocontrol schemas. In addition to operational capabilities, this work featured the use of an improved distributed messaging technology developed by IBM known as Responsive, Reliable, Real-Time (R3) messaging. R3 messaging provides deterministic Quality of Service (QoS) overlays for use in a federated Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) environment. In addition to the R3 technology, the project featured the use of Mashups. Mashups provide the capability for a user to dynamically combine data and services in user specified configurations, resulting in user defined lightweight network-enabled applications. This paper shows how the mediation, distribution, and messaging services were implemented, example results, and how this work could be leveraged to facilitate US and European interoperability in the aviation domain.},

abstract={AgentFly is a software prototype providing a distributed architecture for large-scale NAS-wide simulation implemented as a multi-agent system. AgentFly is implemented on top of the Aglobe platform which is both an implementation framework and a runtime engine for custom agents. It was selected over possible alternatives (e.g. JADE) for its outstanding performance and scalability supporting seamless interaction among heterogeneous software, hardware and human actors. AgentFly system has been developed for over five years. It was initially built f or simulation-based validation and comparison of various approaches for autonomous collision avoidance algorithms adopting the free-flight concept. Later, AgentFly has been extended with high-level control algorithms providing tactical control - i.e. coordination of several autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The same agents and algorithms integrated in AgentFly simulation are also deployed on real UAV platforms. Besides this UAV-related application, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) supports the application of the AgentFly system for simulation and evaluation of the future civilian air-traffic management system. AgentFly has been extended with high-fidelity computational models of civilian airplanes and a parallelization concept integrating dynamic load-balancing. The parallelized approach of AgentFly has been validated in simulation using data of a full civilian air-traffic touching NAS. Nowadays, AgentFly is being extended so that it provides a simulation of ATC functions for the NEXTGEN concept validation. There are being integrated ATC & NAS automation agents which are used to simulate human operation in ATM.},

abstract={There is a need in the international aeronautical community for a broad-band voice and data communications capability to support future safety and regularity of flight services on the airport surface worldwide. This wireless data service can augment the projected Datacomm services to aircraft or vehicles by providing connectivity to Air Traffic Control, Airline Operations Services and Airport Communications Services. Results from the joint Future Communications Study conducted by U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and EUROCONTROL recommended the use of existing wireless communications technology based on the commercially available 802.16 2009 standard as the solution to support the future aviation requirements on the airport surface. This system, referred to as the Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System (AeroMACS) would operate in available protected aviation mobile communications spectrum from 5091MHz to 5150MHz. In addition to alleviating an already congested VHF communications band, the AeroMACS system would also provide a capability to support data intensive applications projected under the FAA's future Next Generation (NextGen) and the Single European Skies Aviation Research (SESAR) Programs. RTCA Special Committee 223 (SC-223) was organized to develop an Aviation Specific System Profile that could be used to guide the design and implementation of equipment and systems used in a broadband airport surface wireless network in the United States. RTCA SC-223 is coordinating with the EUROCAE Working Group 82 and SESAR in the development of the AeroMACS profile. Additionally, since the WiMAX Forum owns and holds the copyright for the 802.16e standard, the RTCA SC-223 profile working group has established a working relationship with the WiMAX Technical Working Group (TWG) to participate in the generation of the AeroMACS profile, and issue any needed change requests to the Mobile WiMAX Release 1 System Profile (DRAFT-T23-001-R010v09-B_MSP) document.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is considering the use of portions of the 5000-5250 MHz band, including the 5091-5150 MHz subband, for the future Airport Network and Location Equipment (ANLE) system. The 5091-5150 MHz subband has also been allocated, on a co-primary basis, to mobile-satellite-service (MSS) feeder uplinks. The compatibility of ANLE networks with the MSS feeder uplinks is evaluated in this paper. An ANLE network architecture based on the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) implementation described in the IEEE 802.16 family of standards is used in the analyses described below. These compatibility analyses consider interference effects from multiple ANLE base stations (BSs) at the same airport. ANLE BSs with antenna patterns having 3-dB horizontal beamwidths of 120° and 90° are analyzed. The effects of these BS antenna pattern types on the compatibility of ANLE networks with MSS feeder links are evaluated. In addition, the potential impact of downtilting the ANLE BS antennas is also addressed for both types of patterns mentioned above. Our results show that, given the parameters identified in the paper for ANLE networks and for MSS feeder uplinks, bandsharing between these systems is feasible.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) and EUROCONTROL's Single European Sky ATM Research Program (SESAR) are transforming the global Air Traffic Management (ATM) as we know it today and will break up with existing roles predicated by 50 year old technology. Similar to SESAR, NextGen right now runs the risk to specify ATM systems based on architectures already out-of-date. While current functionality is based on historical grown technical restrictions, a performance-based and most efficient approach requires new paradigms and eventually has to lead to a balanced approach to prevent over-optimizing one area at the expense of others. The new approach should be based on semantically enriched service models allowing easier development and modular applications for multiple domains. This paper describes an ontology based multi-domain software development approach called Ontology-Based-Control-Room-Framework (ONTOCOR) featuring high software code re-usage and rapid development. It focuses on improving efficiency and increasing the code reusability in order to achieve SESAR's and NextGen's claim for a performance-based and cost-efficient system. The main goal is using semantic technologies to enhance software development in ATM and further, to define tasks with enough similarity to allow applicability in different domains. ONTOCOR uses semantic standards and tools, and seamless information interchange. As described in the European Air Traffic Management Master Plan, “The Information Management Work Package (...) defines the ATM Information Reference Model and the Information Service model (...) by establishing a framework, which defines seamless information interchange between all providers and users of shared ATM information”. A specific example to implement inter domain, is the European ATM Information Reference Model (AIRM). In general, domain independent implementation of components is a future goal and EUROCONTROL defines AIRM as a model, which contains all of the ATM information to be shared in a semantic way. The paper will discuss a first case study for ontology-based modeling and development, a service for digital notices to airmen (NOTAM). Fast information distribution and retrieval are key elements together with service modeling and definitions according to Enterprise Architecture (EA) and SOA principles. Aeronautical Information Management (AIM) using ontologies, provides the benefit of fast ramp up of on-the-spot services, reduced development efforts and additional defined data as source for collaborative decision making within the System-Wide Information Management (SWIM). Such services deployed in NextGen and SESAR will optimize operations workflow, communication needs, and information sharing.},

abstract={The FAA, carrier airlines and passengers are all familiar with the inefficiencies and costs that result from delays in the air transportation system. A significant portion of the delays are associated with operations on or near the surface of major airports. There continues to be keen interest in improving efficiency of surface operations in order to reduce delay costs. The projected growth of air traffic demand is further fueling this interest. The Tower Flight Data Manager (TFDM) initiative by the FAA is aimed at providing tools in the air traffic control tower that would aid in improving operational efficiency on the surface. This initiative seeks to provide benefits through the consolidation of legacy automation systems/displays, the coherent fusion of information from multiple external systems, and the prediction and planning of flight operations on the surface. The ability to predict and plan operations on the surface is delivered to air traffic controllers through a set of decision support tools. These tools provide decision support in the following functional areas: airport configuration, runway assignment, taxi routing, sequencing & scheduling, departure metering, and departure routing. This paper is focused on describing an implementation of these tools in a prototype of the TFDM system. This prototype system is installed at Dallas/Fort Worth airport and is undergoing operational testing. The paper provides selected results from the application of the decision support tools, as well as discussion of future enhancements to the tools.},

year={2011},
volume={},

pages={I6-1-I6-12},
abstract={The FAA is sponsoring research in NextGen Surface-Trajectory-Based Operations (STBO). Surface tactical flow is a component of STBO. Collaborative Departure Queue Management (CDQM), a decision support tool (DST) used to support surface tactical flow, is currently being demonstrated at two airports, neither of which experience frequent snow events. The CDQM DST is hosted on a prototype Surface Decision Support System (SDSS), which models surface traffic and predicts runway queues. To function during snow events, SDSS will need to account for different taxi routes and additional time that deicing requires. Simply put, SDSS will need to know where deicing takes place and how long it will take. To better understand deicing, an interview team, the authors of this paper, visited four northern airports. Prior to the visits the interview team enumerated a series of topics and questions for each topic. The team also identified entities (flight operators, Air Traffic Control (ATC), and the local airport authority) it wished to interview at each airport, as well as personnel in specific positions within each of these entities. Each airport visit spanned two days. From the visits, we learned where and how flight operators deice aircraft and how airport authorities manage runway closures during snow events. Two of the airports, Detroit Metro Airport (DTW) and Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (MSP), perform the majority of their deicing at centralized deicing pads in the movement area. At Boston Logan International Airport (BOS), most of the deicing occurs in the ramp area. At Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD) all of the deicing occurs in the ramp area. As for modifying the SDSS to accommodate deicing, three options are available. One, insert deicing times into the SDSS “back-calculation” sequence, allowing extra time for deicing-time uncertainty. Two, attempt to model deicing times, providing SDSS with improved estimates. Three, begin the SDSS back calculation after deicing. Research in these areas will continue.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration's Surface Trajectory-based Operations (STBO) concept is part of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) vision for the mid- and far-term. The STBO concept describes a suite of decision support tools (DSTs) for use in the air traffic control tower to support safe and efficient surface operations. Research on the STBO DST capabilities is currently being conducted by The MITRE Corporation's Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD). Human-in-the-loop simulations focusing on the STBO DSTs have taken place at CAASD's Aviation Integration Demonstration and Experimentation for Aeronautics (IDEA) Lab in McLean, Virginia under the sponsorship of the FAA's Aviation Research and Technology Development Office and in collaboration with Mosaic ATM, Inc. This paper describes the proposed set of automation capabilities to support ground controller (GC) and local controller (LC) activities in the NextGen mid-term (~2018), including automated DSTs to generate taxi routes and monitor pilot conformance to the assigned taxi route. Automation to support surface conformance monitoring supports goals of 1) a safer airport surface through detecting surface movement non-conformance that contributes to runway incursions and 2) increased efficiency of operations by ensuring taxiing aircraft are in compliance with assigned taxi routes. In the surface conformance monitoring concept, tower controllers will be provided with automation assistance to monitor whether an aircraft is in compliance with its assigned taxi route and to selected control instructions, such as, for example, line up and wait or takeoff clearances. The aircraft's assigned taxi route from its present position to its surface destination is stored in the automation. The surface conformance monitoring automation will compare the current position of the aircraft with the assigned taxi route and detect, or in the far-term, predict, non-conformance. This paper describes automation for surface conformance monitoring and scenarios to illustrate future operations.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is in the process of developing the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) surface decision support tool (DST) capabilities. Several FAA systems and organizations are involved in this effort, specifically Terminal Services (AJT) and System Operations Services (AJR). In order to ensure the proper exchange of data to support these systems during development, the FAA needs to develop interface requirements. Defining the interfaces necessary for managing airport surface operations, in particular departure management, between the Air Traffic Control Tower system, the Tower Flight Data Manager (TFDM), and TFM Systems first necessitated an evaluation of an initial set of Surface DST capabilities (those identified for initial implementation, referred to as the initial DSTs). A determination of which capabilities should be allocated to systems associated with tower and TFM is also necessary. The MITRE Corporation's Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD) developed an initial allocation, referred to here as the Terminal-TFM Initial Functional Allocation. This paper describes the process used to develop the allocation and describes the initial allocation.},

abstract={NASA has been studying a System Oriented Runway Management concept that seeks to harmonize automation systems managing airborne and taxiing aircraft within a metroplex to achieve a more holistic traffic management solution. One element of the SORM initiative has been to develop a new automated decision support capability that can plan the airport configuration to optimize operational efficiency at an airport subject to traffic and weather uncertainty. While planning the runway configuration can provide benefit and is required by other automation concepts, larger benefits are possible by planning other airport configuration decisions, such as runway assignment policies, that are currently made manually by controllers. A laboratory prototype of the airport configuration planning algorithm, referred to as Tactical Runway Configuration Management (TRCM), has been implemented and studied within a simulation environment. This paper describes the TRCM algorithm as well as simulation results for three scenarios drawn from historical data at two airports under various weather and traffic conditions. The TRCM-recommended sequence of airport configurations are shown to result in significantly less delay than the airport configurations that were actually used by controllers, illustrating both the potential benefit from airport configuration optimization and the ability of the developed TRCM algorithm to provide effective airport configuration schedules. The application to several, distinct airports demonstrates the approach is capable of handling the differences between airports with a common algorithm, while providing decision support that respects the current procedures at those airports. Consequently, TRCM could be easily deployed to any airport within the National Airspace System. The algorithmic approach is also extensible to future operational scenarios, providing larger benefits in NextGen environments. NASA has begun the process of transferring the initial TRCM technology to the FAA.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has mandated equipage requirements and performance standards for Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out avionics on aircraft operating in Classes A, B and C airspace, as well as certain other specified classes of airspace within the U.S National Airspace (NAS) by 1 January 2020. ADS-B Out periodically broadcasts information about an aircraft, such as current position, through an onboard transmitter. The FAA's final rule states that, “any ADS-B position source that meets the specified performance standards is acceptable and complies with the requirements in the final rule.” The position source information broadcast for ADS-B is not required to be from the sensor that is being used for navigation. It is currently required for United States Air Force (USAF) aircraft to use Precise Positioning System (PPS) Global Positioning System (GPS) for combat, combat support and combat service support operation. Standard Positioning System (SPS) is currently accepted in civil airspace worldwide for navigation; the use of PPS for navigation is accepted in the United States but not currently accepted in all countries for civil use. To satisfy both requirements, many USAF aircraft are forced to equip with both types of GPS. Providing the transponder with PPS GPS information to satisfy the current ADS-B mandate could also enable future growth to an encrypted squitter like ADS-B function that could provide aircraft location in the area of responsibility (AOR). This paper outlines the advantages and disadvantages of using a PPS sensor to satisfy the ADS-B mandate. This paper will also discuss how the use of one type of position source to satisfy the mandate could potentially benefit the USAF, specifically in the area of integration.},

pages={O4-1-O4-7},
abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is implementing the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) in the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS). The MITRE Corporation's Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (MITRE/CAASD) is supporting the FAA in this mission, and conducts research activities that assist the FAA in leveraging emerging aircraft capabilities. A key area of research is evaluating the feasibility of delegating longitudinal (i.e., in-trail) aircraft spacing to pilots even during low visibility conditions. Longitudinal spacing is needed for avoiding collisions but also for wake turbulence avoidance. As longitudinal spacing is delegated to the flight crew, flight deck-based wake tools are needed to support the task. The pilots need to increase their situational awareness not only of the nearby aircraft but of the wakes that these aircraft produce. The current spacing provided by controllers is dictated by conservative assumptions regarding wake turbulence propagation. Wake turbulence is influenced by the characteristics of the aircraft that produced it as well as winds and other atmospheric conditions. This information could conceivably be transmitted by each aircraft as it enters various phases of flight, such as the approach to an airport. A trailing aircraft could then use this information to construct a picture of the probable location of the wake which would increase the pilot's situational awareness of the wake. To make a realistic assessment of the location and strength of a wake vortex, real-time weather information needs to be known in the vicinity of the aircraft producing the wake. This paper addresses the quality of that information and how any uncertainty in this information will affect the estimate of the location and strength of wake using current wake dynamics estimating programs that could be used on an aircraft. There are systems currently on aircraft that transmit precisely this information to the ground. In the United States there are several airlines that participate in the Meteorological Data Collection and Reporting System (MDCRS) run by ARINC for the airlines. This data has been archived by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) since 2001. Using this data, we have found that there is uncertainty in wind and other atmospheric parameters, even in the approach phase of flight, over a short span of time. Using these results, we show the uncertainty in the wake positions and discuss the implications for using this information for cockpit visualization tools.},

For the certified reference materials, RSDs were below 10% and the recovery values of Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn were from 96.63% to 100.00% when microwave digestion procedure was used for pretreatment. Higher trace elements contents were detected when microwave digestion instead of the other digestion methods was chosen to pre-treat spinach or apple samples. The values of the addition recovery in the studied trace elements of Chinese chive or lettuce ranged from 97.00% to 100.00% due to the use of microwave digestion procedure. Therefore, the use of microwave digestion to pre-treat edible plant samples improved the determination accuracy of trace elements in food nutrition assay and concentrations of Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn in investigated edible plants were acceptable to human consumption at nutritional and toxic levels.},

abstract={So far, conventional RFID protocols provide the security and privacy protections by utilizing the central database model where readers should maintain the persistent connection between the readers and the central database. Recently, serverless RFID protocols, have been proposed to provide more flexible RFID service by removing the need of this connection. In this paper, we first point out the tracing vulnerability of the existing serverless RFID protocols. To address this vulnerability, we suggest a novel method which generates a unique access list for each reader based on groups of tags and multiple pseudonyms. We then propose untraceable and serverless RFID authentication and search protocols with this method. In comparison with, our protocols provide more resilient protection to the tracing vulnerability.

abstract={Accurate models of radar errors are important to the safety analysis of air traffic control systems. We detail in this paper a method for estimating radar azimuth errors from raw time-stamped range/azimuth radar reports of aircraft flying through the airspace. Unlike many previous radar error analyses, the method does not require that the true position of the aircraft be known and is therefore not reliant on expensive flight tests. This provides for the ability to analyze large quantities of data at relatively low cost. Our estimations are based on the assumption of straight and level flight at a constant ground speed, the most common flight regime in the enroute airspace. The method filters radar data so it contains only aircraft flying straight and level at constant ground speed, and then uses this knowledge of the aircraft's behavior to estimate the true aircraft position and the radar error. The filtering algorithms and estimation method are validated using real radar data, simulated radar targets, and flight test data with GPS truth.},

abstract={An RFID system generally consists of tags, readers, and backend servers with the readers charged with authenticating/identifying the tags with the help of the servers. Two important enhancements have been suggested for widespread adoption of RFIDs, namely the use of low cost (5⊄ or less) passive RFID tags and serverless system design to overcome the need for persistent connection between the readers and the servers. Unfortunately, the low cost tags lack computation and storage capabilities to implement sophisticated security protocols to provide tag privacy and anonymous mutual authentication between the readers and the tags. Although several schemes (including some serverless schemes) have been proposed for authentication between tags and readers, they invariably have stringent computation and storage requirements and cannot be implemented in passive tags. In this paper, we propose SAMA, a novel serverless and anonymous mutual authentication scheme for a system consisting of passive tags and readers. Our scheme uses non-linear feedback shift registers and only logical operations to provide robust and anonymous mutual authentication. We perform security analyses and performance evaluation of SAMA and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in comparison with other popular schemes in the literature. Our scheme requires only three message communications between the tag and the reader. Additionally, it requires only 1393 gates and 70 clock cycles at the tag.},

abstract={Federal aviation administration rigid and flexible iterative elastic layered design (FAARFIELD) software program became the exclusive approved method for airport pavement thickness design adopted by federal aviation administration (FAA) in the United States after the advisory circular AC150/5320-6E “Airport Pavement Design and Evaluation” was issued in September 2009. In this paper, the influence of concrete flexural strength (modulus of rupture, MOR) on the portland cement concrete (PCC) surface of airport pavement was investigated using FAARFIELD software program. To investigate the sensitivity of the PCC surface thickness to MOR; many sensitivity runs were conducted with different values of subgrade reaction modulus, K and different subbase layers. The concrete flexural strength was varied within its recommended range (3.45MPa to 5.5 MPa). It was found that increasing the flexural strength from 3.45 MPa to 5.5 MPa reduces the required thickness between 24% and 31%. In addition, empirical equation was proposed to relate the changes in the required thickness of PCC surface with the changes in concrete flexural strength.},

abstract={A number of significant airplane accidents have resulted from windshear encounters during takeoff or landing. In these situations the radar signal received may be affected by a strong ground clutter that may make the conventional windshear detection algorithms implemented on ground-based systems unusable. Typically, the solution to this problem is to employ a clutter rejection filter and then process the filter output to derive weather information. In this study, a parametric bimodal spectral model of the raw radar signal from an airborne Doppler weather radar is proposed. The bimodal shape of the model has been defined as a superposition of clutter and windshear. The model can be used to define a windshear detection algorithm that can also directly estimate the physical weather parameters by using the estimated model parameters without using a clutter rejection pre-filter. Owing to the impossibility of testing a windshear detection system in a realistic environment, a simulated windshear data base has been developed by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) during their windshear research programme. The purpose of this study is to define a parametric bimodal spectral model and demonstrate its validity on the NASA-FAA windshear certification data set.},

abstract={In country such as Malaysia, lightning occurrence is very common and it's capable in causing major damage and interruption to power systems utilities. Thus a highly compatible lightning protection system is crucial in order to ensure human safety and the longevity of the equipments. This study will look into the analysis and design of lightning protection systems for the buildings. One part of the lightning protection system is the down conductor. Down conductor provides the path for high surge from lightning strike on air terminal to the earthing systems. There are conflicting statements in some standards namely IEEE STD 142:1991, FAA-STD-019d and BS 7430:1998, on whether or not the structural steelwork can become a part of the down conductor. However these standards only provide some guidelines and reasoning for the design of lightning protection system for building's structure. So far no experimental and simulation studies have been conducted in this topic. This preliminary study will present experimental result of a small scale concrete beam and copper under impulse test. Two remote earths were selected to provide comparative study on the effect of having two different remote earths. The voltage and current traces for both were described. Impulse impedance obtained for the concrete beam and copper also shown in this study. It was found that the beam is not preferable to be used as down conductor strip compared to the copper due to higher impedance in the beam structure, which can contribute to the delay of high current to be discharged to the earth.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider the airport landing problem of scheduling aircraft on multiple runways in a dynamic fashion. We attempt to modify the aircraft landing sequence from the traditionally used "First-Come-First-Served" (FCFS) order to be able to land more aircraft in a given period of time. Given a set of planes, the goal is to find a sequence such that no plane can land before it is actually available for landing, the minimum safety separation between two consecutive planes is always satisfied, and that the total landing time (makespan) is minimized. Based on the FAA partition of aircraft into weight class, our algorithm, based on previous work, provides a polynomial time feasibility condition for scheduling a set of planes in a given time interval. This algorithm for the dynamic scheduling of aircraft in a multi-runway scenario is factorial in runway number and exponential in aircraft class, both of which are fixed a priori, however it is polynomial in the number of aircraft, which is the dominating factor in the problem. It ensures that the Aircraft Sequencing Problem (ASP) presented above is not NP-Complete and allows us to develop a practical real time ATC execution policy.},

abstract={The importance of system safety has intensified in recent years given the ever-growing use of safety-critical systems in avionics, medicine, nuclear energy, and other fields. However, despite the abundance of standards which exist to provide guidance for the development of safe software for safety-critical systems, there is no consensus on how to achieve safety assurance in a cost-effective fashion. This paper reviews five software safety standards: the FAA System Safety Handbook, the US DoD MIL-STD-882D, the UK MoD DEF-STAN 00-56, NASA-STD 8719.13b and the RTCA DO-178B, and evaluates each in terms of cost effectiveness. It provides an overview of several safety-critical projects, ones that have incurred significant cost overruns as well as ones that have produced safety-critical software in a reasonably cost-effective manner. By virtue of discussing such projects we posit that it is possible to develop software, despite significant safety assurance requirements, without necessarily sacrificing cost. Specifically, projects can realize savings by using mature processes and appropriate tools to assist in development of safety-critical software.},

The rotor side converter is controlled using the field-oriented control to produce three-phase stator voltages with constant magnitude and frequency at different rotor speeds. Moreover, the stator side converter, which is also controlled using field oriented control, is primarily implemented to maintain the magnitude of the DC-link voltage. Furthermore, an intelligent PFNN controller is proposed for both the rotor and stator side converters to improve the transient and steady-state responses of the DFIG system for different operating conditions. The network structure, on-line learning algorithm and convergence analyses of the PFNN are introduced in detail.

abstract={Abstract-In this paper, we propose a T-S fuzzy model based controller for the H-type gantry stage. The synchronized error, which is caused by mismatch quality and friction, is an important control problem for the H-type gantry stage. Utilizing a Lagrangian equation, all states can be formulated as a state equation. Furthermore, the T-S fuzzy model based controller is designed to reduce velocity error, and the position error can also be obtained through internal transformation. Moreover, by utilizing additional transformations, the stabilization problem can be transformed into a linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) problem. Finally, numerical simulation and experimental results are illustrated to demonstrate that the control scheme can effectively reduce synchronized error and tracking error of a gantry stage.},

abstract={A digital signal processor (DSP)-based cross-coupled functional link radial basis function network (FLRBFN) control is proposed in this study for the synchronous control of a dual linear motors servo system which is installed in a gantry position stage. The dual linear motors servo system comprises two parallel permanent magnet linear synchronous motors (PMLSMs). First, the dynamics of the field-oriented control PMLSM servo drive with a lumped uncertainty, which contains parameter variations, external disturbance and friction force, is introduced. Then, to achieve accurate trajectory tracking performance with robustness, an intelligent control approach using FLRBFN is proposed for the field-oriented control PMLSM servo drive system. The proposed FLRBFN is a radial basis function network (RBFN) embedded with a functional link neural network (FLNN). The network structure and its on-line learning algorithms for connective weights, means and standard derivations are described in detail. Moreover, since a cross-coupled technology is incorporated into the proposed intelligent control scheme for the gantry position stage, both of the position tracking errors and synchronous errors of dual linear motors will converge to zero, simultaneously. Finally, some experimental results are illustrated to depict the validity of the proposed control approach.},

Of the three topologies, experimental test carried out shows that topology II results in optimal configuration. Hence, this topology is carefully evaluated in this paper with a view to provide a protection circuitry that will mitigate the lightning surge effect on the ICC box. Critical evaluation of this protection circuitry proves that a metal-oxide varistor and metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistor (MOSFET) are the basic protective device elements. These devices when incorporated in topology II results in the mitigation of the ICC box breakdown against lightning strikes.},

Moreover, the fusion processing time can significantly decrease when several classes are put aside. This operational method can be used effectively to enhance accuracy and processing speed when analyzing the wealth of information available from remote sensing products.},

abstract={A digital signal processor (DSP)-based complementary sliding mode control (CSMC) with Sugeno type fuzzy neural network (SFNN) compensator is proposed in this study for the synchronous control of a dual linear motors servo system installed in a gantry position stage. The dual linear motors servo system comprises two parallel permanent magnet linear synchronous motors (PMLSMs). The dynamics of the single-axis motion system with a lumped uncertainty which contains parameter variations, external disturbances and nonlinear friction force is briefly introduced first. Then, a CSMC is designed to guarantee the precision position tracking requirement in single-axis control for the dual linear motors. Moreover, to enhance the robustness to uncertainties and to eliminate the synchronous error of dual linear motors, the CSMC with a SFNN compensator is proposed where the SFNN compensator is designed mainly to compensate the synchronous error. Finally, some experimental results are illustrated to show the validity of the proposed control approach.},

abstract={To ensure aviation safety, air traffic safety agencies have required minimum aircraft separation standards. Currently, the FAA requires a minimum separation of 3 nautical miles (NM) when aircraft are within 40 NM of an air traffic control surveillance radar and a separation of 5 NM when aircraft are located beyond 40 NM from the radar. At the same time, the FAA permits a separation of 3 NM out to 60 NM for single sensor terminal systems using an ASR-9 Mode S MSSR. The ASR-9 Mode S and ASR-11 Monopulse Secondary Surveillance Radar (MSSR) are similar monopulse systems and the 40 NM limit on terminal separation minima for the ASR-11 may be unnecessarily restrictive. In this paper, we seek to determine if there are any differences in radar azimuth performance between the ASR-9 Mode S and the ASR-11 at ranges of 40 to 60 NM. To perform this analysis we implement a method that estimates radar error from raw time-stamped range and azimuth reports of aircraft flying through the airspace (targets of opportunity). The method filters the data to extract radar reports from aircraft traveling at nearly constant heading, velocity and altitude, and then utilizes knowledge of the aircraft dynamics to accurately estimate the true aircraft position. Our analysis employs a reference system approach comparing the performance of the alternative system, the ASR-11, against the performance of the approved legacy system, the ASR-9 Mode S, to determine if the alternative system's performance is equivalent or better.},

volume={},

pages={1A3-1-1A3-13},
abstract={This paper presents an alternative methodology for deriving ADS-B performance requirements (NIC, NACp, SIL) for backup use in Non-Radar (NRA) and peripheral Radar airspace based on Hazard Analysis methodology proposed by the FAA in recent Safely Management System (SMS) documents. The analysis methodology potentially allows the use of secondary positioning sources such as Flight Management System (FMS) based RNP avionics as well as GPS avionics for primary means ADS-B surveillance. However, for backup ADS-B sources coded as SIL=2 sensors, i.e. with probability of undetected signal-in- space and avionics positioning errors exceeding the position error containment <;= 10-5 per hour, allowed separation errors between aircraft must satisfy strict criteria to assure Minor hazard severity level. Similarly, separation errors for data sources such as GPS sensors coded as SIL=3, i.e. with probability of position error containment <;= 10-7 per hour, must satisfy weaker performance criteria to assure Major hazard severity. Specific NIC and NACp performance criteria are derived in this paper for SIL=2 and SIL=3 sensors for 3 nm Terminal area and 5 nm En-Route radar-like separation standards in NRA airspace to illustrate the proposed methodology. For GPS avionics with SIL=3, minimum integrity and accuracy (NIC and NACp) requirements are equivalent to those previously specified in the NRA SPR document [1] (RTCA DO-303). For SIL=2 sensors, this paper provides generic recommendations for minimum backup positioning NIC and NACp performance, and for separation assurance with mixed SIL=2 and SIL=3 ADS-B data sources. Two recommendations for future ADS-B standards are also discussed that could potentially reduce NIC and NACp criteria for backup ADS-B surveillance. The recommended performance criteria may be feasible for backup 3 and 5 nm surveillance with existing FMS avionics such as INS/DME/DME positioning systems.},

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) proposed communication, navigation, surveillance, air traffic management system (CNS/ATM) plan is the basis for the development of a single global CNS/ATM system concept as it is discussed within this study. Research was evaluated on the efficacy of a single technology, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) within the scope of a single global CNS/ATM system concept. ADS-B has been used within the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Capstone program for evaluation since the year 2000.

title={Operational preferences for ATC data link equipped aircraft: Severe weather reroutes},
year={2011},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1B2-1-1B2-8},
abstract={The Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) requires synchronized investments from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the flight operators who transit the National Airspace System (NAS). Flight operators have emphasized in public dialog that they are not willing to equip aircraft with avionics unless the investing operator directly gains monetized benefits and a competitive advantage. While financial incentives have been considered as a mechanism to close the equipage business case of meeting a threshold of return on investment, the FAA has proposed that operational incentives may be an appropriate mechanism to provide additional assurances to those who invest in NextGen technologies. This research evaluates one potential operational incentive as applied to traffic flow management reroute prioritization for Air Traffic Control (ATC) data link-equipped aircraft in a severe weather scenario. During severe convective weather, many airborne flights need to be rerouted and yet-to-depart flights need a new flight plan and/or ground delay. Prioritizing the scarce resource of constrained sector capacity by equipage capability (rather than by "first come first served") enables data link equipped aircraft to receive shorter reroutes and less departure delay than unequipped aircraft. Due to decreased workload associated with ATC data link aircraft, increased controller productivity should result in the ability to handle more traffic, increasing NAS throughput and capacity. Prioritizing equipped aircraft is not simply a transfer of value from one aircraft group to another; but, of rewarding investment in system enhancing capabilities by pioneering operators. By prioritizing access to constrained airspace to equipped aircraft and encouraging use of ATC data link communications, greater NAS throughput is achieved than would be possible in a voice-only environment. The overall effect is "doing well by doing good" where equipped aircraft are provided better services while improving overall airspace efficiency.},

abstract={In 2010 the FAA formed the Airborne Systems Advisory Team (ASAT). The team consists of airborne system and safely specialists from FAA Headquarters, Directorates, and Aircraft Certification Offices (ACO). Our goal is to provide an efficient and standardized approach for establishing aircraft systems integration and safety assurance for the implementation of emerging technologies and the FAA NextGen operating environment. Current airborne systems designs have become increasingly dependent on highly integrated systems architectures that share power, computing, networking, and input/output resources to support the needs for multiple aircraft functions. Establishing the relationships and transition points between the development, verification and validation activities for these functions throughout systems integration have become more difficult to define and trace to established safety objectives. The ASAT identified SAE, ARP4754a, Development of Civil Aircraft and Systems as an acceptable method for constructing the regulatory compliance for highly-integrated or complex aircraft systems. Therefore, we published an Advisory Circular (AC) to formally recognize the methodology provided by the ARP and its part in demonstrating an acceptable means of compliance to the Title 14 CFR. In the paper we will look at an actual incident and its casual factors to illustrate the challenges we face when we integrate systems and how important it is to thoroughly analyze and test that the safety objectives established for aircraft and system level functions are compliant with the applicable Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14CFR). We will identify the regulatory requirement for safety in installations of systems and equipment and look at how our current policy and guidance applies to this challenge and what new policy and guidance may be needed.},

abstract={The task of the Air Traffic Control (ATC) is to optimize the use of air space and to avoid collision among aerial vehicles. Air space can be defined as a set of infinite number of planes, direction, routes etc. The existing ATC system can to maximizing the use of available air space but the human involvement at various stages limits it capability. The NextGen [1] vision of air traffic control system proposed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mainly focuses on automation of various aspects of ATC system and minimizing human intervention to improve efficiency and performance. We envision that in the future it will be required to eliminate the location specific (airport based) takeoff and landing. Lightweight Aircraft should be allowed to take off from any location and be allowed to land anywhere. We consider the future requirements and present a novel automated air traffic control and collision avoidance system in this paper. In this paper we introduce a unique scheme of synchronization among aerial vehicles and air traffic control systems. It helps to obtain unique route for each flight to minimize the conflict but if it is not possible to find a unique route then the scheme provides an optimized solution that efficiently uses shared resources such as runways, navaids [2] etc. We also present a new conflict resolution and collision avoidance technique using self synchronization among aerial vehicles without the help from ATC.},

abstract={With the expected worldwide increase of air traffic during the coming decade, both the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), as well as Eurocontrol's Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) program have, as part of their plans, air traffic management solutions that can increase performance without requiring time-consuming and expensive infrastructure changes. One such solution involves the ability of both controllers and flight crews to deliver aircraft to the runway with greater accuracy than is possible today. Previous research has shown that time-based spacing techniques, wherein the controller assigns a time spacing to each pair of arriving aircraft, is one way to achieve this goal by providing greater runway delivery accuracy that produces a concomitant increase in system-wide performance. The research described herein focuses on a specific application of time-based spacing, called Airborne Precision Spacing (APS), which has evolved over the past ten years. This research furthers APS understanding by studying its performance with realistic wind conditions obtained from atmospheric sounding data and with realistic wind forecasts obtained from the Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) short-range weather forecast. In addition, this study investigates APS performance with limited surveillance range, as provided by the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) system, and with an algorithm designed to improve APS performance when an ADS-B signal is unavailable. The results presented herein quantify the runway threshold delivery accuracy of APS under these conditions, and also quantify resulting workload metrics such as the number of speed changes required to maintain spacing.},

abstract={Flights incur a large percentage of delay on the ground during the departure process; however, predicting the taxi-out time is difficult due to uncertainties associated with the factors influencing it, such as airport surface traffic, downstream traffic restrictions, runway configuration, weather, and human causes. Airport Surface Detection Equipment, Model X (ASDE-X) surveillance data provides high resolution coverage of aircraft surface movement which can be leveraged to address this problem. This paper presents a novel approach which builds an adaptive taxi-out prediction model based on a historical traffic flow database generated using the ASDE-X data. The model correlates taxi-out time and taxi-out delay to a set of explanatory variables such as aircraft queue position, distance to the runway, arrival rates, departure rates and weather. Two prediction models are developed. One treats aircraft movement from starting location to the runway threshold uniformly while the other models aircraft time to get to the runway queue different from the wait time experienced by the aircraft while in the runway queue. The models are evaluated using data from New York's John F Kennedy (JFK) airport during the summer of 2010. Results show significant improvement in taxi-out predictions as compared to predictions from FAA's Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS).},

abstract={Weather uncertainty is a major cause of unnecessary delays within the National Airspace System (NAS). In particular, the high uncertainty in terminal area weather forecasts combined with the uncertain correlation between weather and airport capacity makes the task of planning strategic traffic management initiatives such as ground delay programs (GDPs) very difficult. At the twelve airports in the NAS with the most GDPs issued during 2008 and 2009, weather-related GDPs were canceled an average of 95 minutes earlier than the initially scheduled GDP end time and, when GDP revisions were issued, nearly two hours earlier than the revised GDP end time. As part of NextGen, the FAA and NASA are researching methods for reducing the negative impact of weather on the NAS and exploring ways to improve collaborative air traffic management (CATM) processes through increased automation and improved decision support tools (DSTs). This paper introduces the Weather Translation Model for GDP Planning (WTMG), a statistical model for translating weather forecasts into probabilistic arrival capacity predictions over a strategic time horizon of up to twelve hours. The model is self-training and independent of forecast product. With a sufficiently large historical data set, the model is able to build probability distributions for the airport arrival rate (AAR) in future time intervals conditioned on weather forecasts and the current state of the airport. These distributions are sampled to build probabilistic capacity scenarios with the end goal of providing inputs for CATM DSTs for GDP planning. Two versions of WTMG are presented: static WTMG samples independently at time interval; dynamic WTMG draws sample capacity vectors that are dependent across time intervals. Each version of the model is demonstrated using each of two distinct forecast products: the Terminal Area Forecast (TAF) and the Localized Aviation Model Output Statistical Program (LAMP).},

abstract={The technology and procedural changes planned for operational improvements in air transportation, such as those planned for the Next-Generation Air Transport System (NextGen), must be justified in terms of both safety and efficiency. Performance metrics that give insight into the frequency, severity, and causality of the problems being addressed are needed to provide quantitative justification of the improvements under consideration. Estimation of benefits in a mixed-equipage environment with incremental adoption of operational improvements requires performance metrics that can be applied to individual flights. This need is particularly acute in the airport environment, where performance depends on the close coordination of many aircraft and multiple operational needs. Broad measures such as average taxi-in or taxi-out times do not give sufficient insight into causality to predict the efficiency benefits of specific changes. Safely benefits are particularly difficult to predict, as incidents showing obvious hazards are relatively rare; precursors to safely lapses should be more common but are difficult to define and detect. These needs can be addressed by a providing fine-grain analysis of both the specific characteristics and the context of each movement on the airport surface. A process that supports quantitative investigation of causal factors underlying both safety and efficiency shortfalls has been developed and used to improve the prediction of operational improvement benefits. The process has been applied to tasks performed for the FAA's Air Traffic Organization (ATO) and other customers. The process provides both detailed metrics of aircraft movement in the full airport terminal area environment and detection and characterization of unusual events and patterns in those movements. Such events may be instances of or precursors to safety incidents, and may also reveal instances of degraded efficiency in airport operations. Results from initial applications of the process to operational airport surveillance data are presented. These examples include the analysis of aircraft surface trajectories to find anomalies in surface movement, specifically sudden stops on taxiways and runways, irregular turns at taxiway intersections, and unusual taxi routes indicating confusion or inefficiency. The use of contextual information such as proximate traffic and visibility conditions to infer causality is also described.},

This paper presents two case studies based on the data produced by the automated anomaly detection and scoring system; the case studies validate the system and explore causes of anomalies. Specifically, the relationship between frequency of anomaly occurrence and surface congestion is explored and a study of the relationship between the rate of occurrence of sudden-stop (SST) anomalies and other factors, including runway configuration and time-of- year, is undertaken. The paper discusses the role of automated anomaly detection in the development of safety management systems and the evaluation of benefits and risks of technology (e.g., moving map display) that may be deployed to mitigate anomaly occurrence and to improve airport operational safety and efficiency.},

abstract={The current operational practice in scheduling air traffic arriving at an airport is to adjust flight schedules by delay, i.e. a postponement of an aircraft's arrival at a scheduled location, to manage safely the FAA-mandated separation constraints between aircraft. To meet the observed and forecast growth in traffic demand, however, the practice of time advance (speeding up an aircraft toward a scheduled location) is envisioned for future operations as a practice additional to delay. Time advance has two potential advantages. The first is the capability to minimize, or at least reduce, the excess separation (the distances between pairs of aircraft immediately in-trail) and thereby to increase the throughput of the arriving traffic. The second is to reduce the total traffic delay when the traffic sample is below saturation density. A cost associated with time advance is the fuel expenditure required by an aircraft to speed up. We present an optimal control model of air traffic arriving in a terminal area and solve it using the Pontryagin Maximum Principle. The admissible controls allow time advance, as well as delay, some of the way. The cost function reflects the trade-off between minimizing two competing objectives: excess separation (negatively correlated with throughput) and fuel burn. A number of instances are solved using three different methods, to demonstrate consistency of solutions.},

The flight trials were conducted on the Olympia Six (OLM6) Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR) for the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport by select Alaska Airlines pilots flying Boeing 737 Next Generation (B737NG) aircraft. The operational concept was the assignment of the Scheduled Time-of-Arrival (STA) from the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) flow management tool as the RTA for aircraft to meet with improved delivery accuracy. In the trials, many aircraft successfully met assigned crossing times at OLM fix using the RTA function of their advanced FMS allowing fuel-efficient descents. This paper describes the results of the flight trial, indicating that the current generation of B737NG avionics can meet meter fix times generated by TMA within 20 seconds while honoring air traffic control (ATC) restrictions of speed and altitude given appropriate FMS configurations.},

abstract={Ensemble learning with the Bagging Decision Tree (BDT) model was used to assess the impact of weather on airport capacities at selected high-demand airports in the United States. The ensemble bagging decision tree models were developed and validated using the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aviation System Performance Metrics (ASPM) data and weather forecast at these airports. The study examines the performance of BDT, along with traditional single Support Vector Machines (SVM), for airport runway configuration selection and airport arrival rates (AAR) prediction during weather impacts. Testing of these models was accomplished using observed weather, weather forecast, and airport operation information at the chosen airports. The experimental results show that ensemble methods are more accurate than a single SVM classifier. The airport capacity ensemble method presented here can be used as a decision support model that supports air traffic flow management to meet the weather impacted airport capacity in order to reduce costs and increase safety.},

abstract={Over the last decade there has been considerable research into fuel efficient arrival and climb operations by the FAA, EuroControl, NASA, airlines, and other stakeholders. Fuel efficient arrivals are generally referred to as Continuous Descent Arrival (CDA) or Optimal Profile Descent (OPD). In today's arrival operation, it is not unusual for a pilot to receive between 4-10 step-downs, level-offs, or altitude assignments by ATC, allowing controllers to de-conflict, sequence and space flights. OPD and fuel efficient climb, known as Continuous Climb Departure (CCD), eliminate level segments as much as possible while maintaining separation and flight safety. NASA has proposed a set of trajectory based operations that leverage improved trajectory automation and produce more fuel efficient profiles using near-term concepts. To transition the research from concept/demonstration/prototype efforts to fielded operational systems requires adherence to the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) process. The objective of this paper is to support the transition to NAS-wide implementation of OPD and CCD operations by defining the available benefit pool for fuel efficient arrivals and climbs. We do so by examining characteristics of flight level offs that occur in today's operations using several days of NAS-wide surveillance. The assumptions, data sources and challenges, metrics, and process are described. Results are first presented for operations in high density centers and are then described in NAS-wide benefits. The results provide the translation into NAS-wide fuel savings.},

abstract={The use of RNAV procedures in the terminal area coupled with optimal profile descents (OPD) is showing promise as a viable near-term step towards full blown NextGen trajectory based operations. A strong point of RNAV OPD operations in the TRACON is that they can be performed with existing avionics capabilities as most modern transport aircraft have Flight Management Systems (FMS) capable of RNAV and Vertical Navigation (VNAV). In fact, such an operation is currently being considered by the FAA as a candidate for extension of 3D Paths in Arrival Management (3D PAM) operations through the TRACON. The objective is to determine how controllers and pilots can support this RNAV-based operation with little or no reversion to manual vectoring, even in complex high-density airspace. This paper examines the use of speed intervention during an RNAV procedure as a means of ensuring safe spacing through terminal area merge points, while executing OPD procedures.},

abstract={The Converging Runway Display Aid (CRDA) is a simple, passive visualization tool that has been available in the terminal automation systems in the National Airspace System (NAS) for about 20 years. CRDA is geared towards simplifying the use of intersecting or converging approaches and paths. Its simplicity has often prompted aviation enthusiasts to hypothesize wider use in the NAS to improve both the safely and capacity of the system. Even so, the tool has not realized wide-spread use in the NAS. Recently, RTCA Task Force V recommended that it be implemented at more sites in the NAS. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has incorporated its wider use as one of its flight plan goals. This has helped its deployment at several new key sites. This paper explores basic factors that contribute to the challenges in deploying CRDA and how they could be addressed. It presents the example of the recent CRDA deployment at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) to document and illustrate how this process can and has been applied successfully. It describes the impact of the CRDA use at EWR by analyzing one year of operational data. It concludes with a report on the outlook for CRDA deployment in the NAS.},

abstract={Surface Trajectory-Based Operations (STBO) is a concept and research area for improving the safety and efficiency of surface operations and is envisioned as part of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). STBO provides a concept of operating the surface in the midand far-term that includes automated decision support tools to assist air traffic controllers and managers in the tower with responsibilities such as planning for airport configuration changes, assigning runways and taxi routes, sequencing aircraft for departure, and monitoring pilot compliance to clearances. The MITRE Corporation's Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD) has led an effort to evaluate STBO concept elements through human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations using prototype automation developed by Mosaic ATM. This paper describes the results of a third STBO HITL simulation that assessed how taxi routing and surface conformance monitoring decision support tools can enhance the safety and efficiency of surface operations. This simulation included consideration of a local and ground controller, implementation of a configuration change, and multiple traffic loads. Results showed that automation had positive impacts on controllers' ability to detect pilot deviations, efficiently move surface traffic, and effectively communicate with pilots. These results helped take a step towards validating the STBO concepts by showing a clear benefit of the STBO decision support tools. The results also point to specific areas where improvements can be made to the design of these decision support tools.},

abstract={Accurate trajectory prediction is the cornerstone for future Air Traffic Management (ATM) concepts worldwide. To this purpose, researchers from Airservices Australia, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and EUROCONTROL have collaborated on research into this important topic. Trajectory prediction is the process in which the future trajectory of an aircraft is computed based on a model of the aircraft's performance, forecast meteorological conditions and aircraft intent: a script that indicates how the aircraft is operated to fulfill the user-intentions of the flight while satisfying imposed constraints. The lateral component of the trajectory is mostly defined by the flight plan and if the plan is kept up to date, lateral uncertainty should be minimal. Longitudinally however, the problem is more complicated since not all required longitudinal aircraft intent is known to the ground-based Trajectory Predictor (TP). This paper presents the longitudinal performance of operational TPs from the FAA, EUROCONTROL, and Airservices Australia, which illustrates that inaccurate longitudinal aircraft intent and resulting excessive prediction errors are evident in all three TPs. The performance of the ground-based TPs was subsequently compared to data extracted from the aircraft's Flight Management System (FMS) through Future Air Navigation Systems (FANS) technology. FANS is standard equipment on wide-body aircraft and some domestic fleets, yet its full potential is widely under utilized. The paper argues significant improvement to ground based trajectory prediction accuracy is possible if the ground-TP is enhanced with aircraft data. It further demonstrates that this benefit can be achieved using aircraft data-link technologies, available today, to transmit FMS trajectory information.},

abstract={The differences in performance of various manufacturers' Flight Management Systems (FMSs) and their associated Flight Management Computers (FMCs) have the potential for significant operational impact on the air traffic control system and as such require continuous examination. While Area Navigation (RNAV) and Required Navigation Performance (RNP) procedures and routes are designed according to criteria contained in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) orders, FMC manufacturers design their systems in accordance with Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards (MASPS) and Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for area navigation systems, Technical Standard Orders and Advisory Circulars. It is anticipated that the resulting performance of the aircraft FMC will meet the procedure design requirements identified in the FAA criteria. The resulting variation however has posed a challenge for the criteria development and Air Traffic operations. A goal of this paper is to provide supporting data for the development of instrument flight procedures where aircraft operations meet expectations for repeatability and predictability to levels of performance sufficient to support Performance-based Navigation (PBN) worldwide and specifically in the National Airspace System (NAS) and the Next Generation (NextGen) environment. Sometimes, due to the nearly independent development of procedure design criteria and aircraft performance standards, the paths of various aircraft on the same procedure do not overlap and do not match the intent of the procedure designer. This paper is a continuation of five studies, beginning in 2006, (all presented at previous Digital Avionics System Conferences) with the basic title of Analysis of Advanced Flight Management Systems (FMSs), FMC Field Observations Trials. They have shown that these differences may result from any or all of the following: variations in FMC equipment installed on the aircraft; variations and errors in procedure coding in the FMC navigation database; variations in aircraft to FMC interface and associated aircraft performance capabilities; and variations in flight crew training and procedures. The hypothesis of this paper is that the FMCs built by the major avionics manufacturers and installed as the core of the FMC/FMS combinations in various airframe platforms will perform differently with respect to the construction and execution of holding patterns. The paper will attempt to identify and quantify those differences. As airspace becomes more complex, the use of RNAV and RNP holding patterns will become increasingly more important as a tool to reduce the size of holding protected areas. Today, there are no FAA criteria for RNP holding and there are many questions unanswered about RNAV holding. Some of these questions relate to how FMC's build a holding pattern path, how they compute holding pattern entries, how the FMC computes holding pattern time, and how they determine miles from the holding fix for a Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) hold. Controlled field observations trials were completed using fourteen FMC avionics test benches at seven major FMC manufacturers and two high fidelity flight simulators at a major airline. This year's analysis of holding patterns follows The MITRE Corporation's previous analyses of FMC lateral navigation (LNAV), vertical navigation (VNAV), radius-to-fix (RF) path conformance, lateral and vertical path integration and RNAV off the ground Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs). The intent of this report is to contribute data, analysis, conclusions and recommendations to industry and the FAA that may influence criteria development to enhance RNAV and RNP operations.},

pages={4B1-1-4B1-10},
abstract={Air transportation system authorities throughout the world are becoming increasingly focused on improving the efficiency of air operations to enhance the safety and capacity of their systems and also respond to environmental concerns, all while meeting the demands of the increasingly large traveling public. A critical component to improving efficiencies within air transportation systems is the implementation of a performance-based navigation (PBN) concept. That concept leverages the navigation and performance capabilities of the aircraft by structuring the airspace such that the aircraft can maneuver efficiently with minimal fuel expenditure from takeoff to landing. The US Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) and Europe's Single European Sky Air Traffic Management (ATM) Research Initiative (SESAR) are focused on a PBN design for future airspace operations. One key element of those future airspace designs is a specific aircraft navigation capability that allows the aircraft to traverse over the ground on a fixed ground path consistently, predictably, and reliably while turning. That capability is referred to as a "Constant Radius ARC to a Fix (RF) navigation leg. When incorporated into an instrument procedure design, the RF leg is used by the aircraft's flight management computer system (FMS) to consistently fly the turn over the same ground track. This accommodates avoidance of environmentally sensitive areas or other restricted airspace and also provides for the flexibility to shorten the time and miles traveled by the aircraft thus reducing fuel burn and emissions. Over the past few years, the RF leg has been available only to specially qualified operators and aircraft. However, recent innovative action by the FAA and its aviation industry partners are promoting the RF leg for incorporation into public instrument procedure designs so that all segments of the industry can take advantage of the operational enhancements realized by instrument procedures containing the flexible RF leg. This paper describes the RF leg, how it can be implemented into instrument procedure designs for use by the aircraft navigation systems and the benefits to current and future air transportation systems when it is made available to all aviation segments.},

year={2011},

pages={5C5-1-5C5-12},
abstract={The use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) by the military has greatly increased over the last decade. This experience has led to the development of Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and technology in line with defense and security missions. It is evident that UASs are becoming the military's choice for dull, dirty and dangerous missions. Prompted by the military's experience, civil agencies have identified a large variety of missions that potentially could be performed by UASs with clear benefits. UAS are already in production and use today. However, they are limited in their use within civil airspace due to the lack of mature sense-and-avoid technology and undefined methods for proving safety. These key requirements will not only enable military, civil, and eventually commercial objectives, they will have a direct impact in initial and operating costs. Therefore, to unlock the potential of UASs, it is required to develop affordable UAS solutions that can be safely and transparently integrated into non- segregated airspace. It is important to realize that unmanned civil aviation is a revolution, not an evolution, as CONOPS and the necessary technology for flight in non-segregated airspace are not mature, and standards (MASPS or MOPS) do not exist. Therefore, UAS integration into non-segregated airspace will require the simultaneous development of CONOPS, technology and standards, and the involvement of all UAS stakeholders, that is, end users, industry, regulators, Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), etc. from all over the world. Two groups are leading the development of standards for safe and transparent UAS integration into non-segregated airspace: EUROCAE WG-73 in Europe; and RTCA SC-203 in the US. WG-73 will propose its developed standards to EASA and the European National Aviation Authorities (NAAs), whereas SC-203 will propose its developed standards to the FAA. Therefore, if WG-73 and SC-203 are not aligned, there is a risk that different standards are developed on either side of the Atlantic. Consequently, UAS solutions will not be interoperable, and standards will be costlier and take longer to develop. This is not in the interest of any of the UAS stakeholders and especially the end users. This paper will compare the activities of WG-73 and SC-203. The focus will be on Sense-And-Avoid (SAA) activities for Beyond Visual Line-Of-Sight (BVLOS) operations and will expand on the ATM environment, markets/CONOPS, and UAS safety objectives.},

abstract={Wake turbulence encounters are a significant concern to pilots flying in the National Airspace System (NAS). The MITRE Corporation's Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD) has worked with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to increase efficiency and capacity in the NAS that will come with the FAA's Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). By increasing efficiency and capacity, there will be a corresponding reduction in required separations that exist in operations today. As operations are optimized and these separations are reduced, it is important that there is not an increase in wake encounter rates that would tend to limit the acceptance of NextGen. NextGen technology, however, may enable the community to provide better tools to pilots and controllers for avoiding wake, thereby bounding the wake encounter rate at no more than today's operationally acceptable level. In this paper, arrival and departure procedures that take advantage of Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS- B) and Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI) technology in the cockpit are reviewed and their performance during a human-in-the-loop evaluation discussed.},

abstract={RTCA/DO-254, "Design Assurance Guidance for Airborne Electronic Hardware" [1] is currently enforced by the FAA via the Advisory Circular (AC) 20-152 [2] as a means of compliance and guidance for the design assurance of complex electronic hardware such as FPGAs, PLDs and ASICs in airborne systems. RTCA/DO-254 Section 6 (Verification Process) defines a set of verification objectives and methods that present several new challenges to design and verification engineers of airborne electronic hardware. This paper points out the most significant challenges that can be encountered during the hardware verification process of FPGA designs under DO-254 guidelines. More importantly, this paper proposes a verification methodology that replays RTL simulation during hardware testing at full speed utilizing the same simulation testbench as test vectors.},

abstract={Air carrier operators have long recognized the benefits of adapting portable computing devices, such as commercially available laptop computers or special purpose computers, to perform a variety of functions traditionally delegated to the flight crew. One of the original applications of EFB systems was to reduce the 40 pounds of paper products that the flight crew typically carries onboard aircraft (e.g., airplane flight manuals, checklists, aeronautical charts including approach plates). These devices have been approved as a direct replacement of hard copy chart information contained in the crew flight bag, thus the term Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) has entered aviation vernacular. Operators have increasingly sought additional EFB capability, as well as expanding the scope of operational use. Operators are now seeking approval for EFB use during normal operations. A commensurate expansion of EFB functionality and aircraft interface complexity has also taken place to include the capability to perform various combinations including: (1) calculation of flight manual performance data, (2) display of normal and non-normal checklist items, (3) display of approach plate overlays, (4) display of video security camera images and infrared camera images, (5) depiction of near real-time weather information and aeronautical data, (6) display of traffic information, (7) upload of flight planning information into the aircraft Flight Management System, (8) data communication capability with a ground station, (9) Internet connectivity, etc. This expansion of capability resulted in the need to establish joint certification and operational guidance material to assess hazards associated with EFB loss or malfunction (misleading information being presented to the flight crew). Certain EFB systems are used for wire-less communication with Airline Operations Centers (AOC) which could improve maintenance and dispatch times.},

abstract={Significant developments in the recent times have led to an increasing use of mobile devices such as smart phones in accessing Internet services and applications over wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a security architecture for counteracting denial of service attacks in Beyond 3G (B3G) network architecture with mobile nodes. We describe the system architecture and discuss the different cases of attack scenarios involving the mobility of the attacking and victim nodes. Our proposed solution takes into account practical issues such as limited resources of the mobile nodes. It has distinct advantages such as monitoring of the traffic to the victim node and the attack traffic being dropped before reaching the victim, the ability to trace back the attacking node and prevent the attack at the home agent or foreign agent that is closer to the attacking node, and the ability to deal with dynamic changes in attack traffic patterns. We also present an analysis of our proposed architecture as well as simulation results.},

abstract={To meet the significant increase in civil air traffic demand in the National Airspace System (NAS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is cooperating with other departments to develop Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). NextGen will greatly increase the NAS capacity, efficiency, safety, flexibility, and environmental protection. Aviation Security is one of the core components in NextGen. Without security protection, all NextGen functions will be vulnerable to various attacks and cannot work robustly. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Aviation Security (IAS) framework for defense-in-depth of various aspects of NextGen security such as cyber security and aircraft anti-hijacking. IAS uses a multi-layered, cross-component, and multi-planed (data plane and control plane) structure. Multiple components in NextGen such as communication, navigation, surveillance, air traffic management, aircraft anti-hijacking, access control, biometrics, risk analysis and management, etc, are processed integratedly through information fusion to enhance the security performance of each module. We will present a detailed implementation approach of IAS including the AlertEnterprise based Integrated Risk Management (IRM) Model, defense-in-depth of communication, navigation, surveillance, and aircraft anti-hijacking. Compared with disparate systems, the proposed IAS has much higher security performance to be effective against both outsider and insider threats.},

abstract={A DSP-based probabilistic fuzzy neural network (PFNN) controller to control a two-stage ac-dc charger is pro- posed in this study. The charger is composed of an ac-dc boost converter with power factor correction and a phase-shift full- bridge dc-dc converter. Moreover, the designed charger adopts a constant-current and constant-voltage (CC-CV) charging strategy to charge lithium-ion battery packs. To improve the transient of voltage regulation during load variation, a PFNN controller is pro- posed to replace the traditional proportional-integral controller. Furthermore, the discontinuous charging voltage and current during the transition between the CC and CV charging modes can also be reduced significantly using the proposed PFNN controller. The network structure and the online learning algorithms of the PFNN controller are introduced in detail. In addition, the control performances of the proposed PFNN control system for CC-CV charging are evaluated by experimental results.},

year={2011},

pages={1011-1015},
abstract={Human errors are held responsible for over 65% of accidents in more than one hundred years of manned aviation history. To evaluate the role of human factors related to accidents of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a sample data of 56 US Army UAV accidents was used in this study, out of which 32 were related to accidents of Hunter UAV and remaining 24 accidents were of Shadow UAV. The study revealed that human factor was involved in 15 (47%) accidents for Hunter and 5 (21%) for Shadow. Classification of the accident data was a two-step process. In the first step, accidents were classified into the categories of human factors, maintenance, aircraft, and unknown. Accidents could be classified into more than one category. In the second step, those accidents classified as human factors-related were further categorized according to specific human factors issues such as alerts/alarms, display design, procedural error, skill-based error, or others. For most of the UAV systems, electromechanical failure was more of a causal factor than human error. One significant finding from an analysis of the data is that these two UAV systems are very different, resulting in different kinds of accidents and different human factors issues. A second finding is that many of the occurred accidents could have been anticipated through an analysis of the user interfaces employed and procedures implemented for their use. Finally this paper summarizes the various human factors issues related to the UAV accidents, and some recommendations are given to minimize the failures due to human factors.},

More than 50 years of investment and advancements in remote weather-sensing systems (satellite-based as well as ground-based radar) have resulted in remarkable capabilities; however, these systems cannot deliver observations to meet current requirements for timeliness, positional precision, and the acquisition of data that can only be obtained in situ. Highly mobile observations systems are needed to deliver in situ data that are critical for the verification and validation of current models and simulations. This is the challenge in engineering the tools of scientific discovery, one of the 14 Engineering Grand Challenges of the 21st Century posed by the National Academy of Engineering [2].

abstract={Aircraft cabin channel model is quite important for verification of the key technologies in the onboard wireless communications, especially the schemes of Mobile Communications on Aircraft (MCA) in physical layer, such as modulation, coding and antenna design etc. The aircraft cabin channel has two important features:1) Due to the tunnel-shape of the cabin, the radio waves reflet many times and the multiple signals are abundant; 2) There is not specific statistical channel model for cabin wireless communications. It is difficult to take the channel measurement due to the restriction of FAA and the manufacture of the aircraft, e.g., Boeing. Moreover, establishing such statistical model needs large experiment data of channel measurement, which is really costly and time-exhausted. In this paper, a novel real-time aircraft cabin channel model is established with ray-tracing algorithm. This model can directly produce the real-time simulation result of the channel. Furthermore, the result can be further employed to build up the statistical model instead of the experimental channel measurement data. This method is really economic compared with the traditional experimental method.},

abstract={A three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) dynamic model-based intelligent nonsingular terminal sliding mode control (INTSMC) system is proposed in this study for the precision contours tracking of a gantry position stage. A Lagrangian equation-based 3-DOF dynamic model for the gantry position stage is derived first. Then, to minimize the synchronous error and tracking error in the precision contours tracking, the 3-DOF dynamic model-based INTSMC system is proposed. In this approach, a nonsingular terminal sliding mode control is designed for the gantry position stage to achieve finite time tracking control. Moreover, to increase the robustness and to improve the control performance, an interval type-2 recurrent fuzzy neural network, and asymmetric membership function, which combines the advantages of interval type-2 fuzzy logic system, recurrent neural network, and asymmetric membership function, is developed as an estimator to approximate a lumped uncertainty. Finally, some experimental results of the gantry position stage for optical inspection application are obtained to show the validity of the proposed control approach.},

abstract={Accuracy of land cover classification is generally improved by inputting multi-sensory and GIS data since complex vegetation type identification benefits from synergism of complementary information. However, multi-source fusion can also deteriorate accuracy when some classes do not benefit from all sources. On the basis of this premise, we introduce a Selective Fusion (SELF) scheme based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) which use a single source for source-specific classes and fuse all sources for classes considered as “in difficulty”. Our method yields better overall accuracy and Kappa than the classical systematic approach since it takes advantage of the accuracy achieved by SVM and its ability to weight numerous and heterogeneous sources without the drawback of being sensible to irrelevant data for source-specific classes. This operational method can be used efficiently to enhance accuracy when analyzing the wealth of information available from remote sensing products.},

abstract={Growing demand for use of the National Airspace System (NAS) has resulted in research and development programs to modernize the air traffic control system. The primary focus of the US FAA's Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) plan is to transform the air transportation system into a more flexible, adaptive, and highly automated system capable of handling two to three times the current traffic. According to the NextGen plan, Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) is designed to improve the safety, capacity, and efficiency of the NAS. ADS-B works by broadcasting flight information such as the flight number, position, speed and intent using satellite-based navigation systems, to other aircraft or air traffic control facilities. Our research interests focus on the interoperability of the ADS-B data link with existing surveillance systems and operational ability of ADS-B to assist the flight crew by meeting safety assurance. Because the NAS involves a multitude of inter-acting agents and technologies, the high complexity of integrated sensing and decision support for the air traffic control is the main challenge. We have developed a simulation environment which includes an air traffic model, existing surveillance systems, ADS-B systems, and wireless channel model. The critical issue of the interoperability and collaboration between existing systems and ADS-B is validated. Two parts of the interference issue are analysed: (1) interference from ADS-B to existing systems, and (2) interference from existing systems to the ADS-B. It is shown that ADS-B meets the performance requirements of both air-to-ground and air-to-air ranges. Furthermore, the effect of ground surveillance systems and aircraft density to the ADS-B performance along the flight path is analysed.},

abstract={Developed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Next Generation Air Transportation System project (NextGen) is an initiative working towards improvement of the National Airspace System (NAS). NextGen seeks to reduce both fuel consumption and the adverse environmental impacts of air transportation, while improving safety and accommodating foreseeable industry expansion. The NextGen project encompasses improvements in all phases of flight, including ground operations, takeoffs, and descents. This paper describes a simulation study conducted to explore and enhance flight arrival operations at Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD). Current Air Traffic Control (ATC) procedures incorporate a standard step-down descent to ensure smooth handoffs of aircraft among controllers managing traffic at different altitudes. Recent research has shown that Optimized Profile Descent (OPD) techniques help reduce fuel emissions, noise, and travel time. With the support of industry experts at the MITRE Corporation, a non-profit government research organization in alliance with the FAA, the team developed a simulation model using Terminal Area Route Generation Evaluation and Traffic Simulation (TARGETS) software and Base of Aircraft Data (BADA). The team evaluated and compared feasible OPD procedures for flights traveling through or near the BARIN waypoint to current Area Navigation (RNAV) operations at IAD. TARGETS is a state-of-the-art interface used to support the design of RNAV routes and to confirm feasibility and conformance to current safety regulations and navigation procedures. BADA was used to quantify the benefits of the designed routes in comparison to the standard arrival route. The capstone team designed an OPD procedure specifically for the southern arrival flow at IAD. The results for this report include a comparison between the two designed OPD routes and the standard step-down approach route using the total fuel burn as the chosen metric.},

abstract={The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) is a comprehensive, ongoing transformation of the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS). NextGen will fundamentally change NAS operations by implementing advanced technologies to monitor and operate aircraft. NextGen poses substantial systems integration challenges due to numerous technical, organizational, political, and social perspectives and their complex interdependencies. Specifically, this paper addresses the challenges associated with integrating Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the NAS, utilizing systems-of-systems methodology to identify and assess the integration risks. The team started by studying simple systems-of-systems to explore how modeling such systems can be applied to more complex systems, such as NextGen. Due to NextGen's evolving nature, the team adopted a dynamic methodological roadmap to guide risk assessment. The roadmap, an iterative methodological approach, involves developing (i) a comprehensive Hierarchical Holographic Model to identify the UAS shared state variables that contribute most to potential risk resulting from UAS integration into the NAS, (ii) a list of risk scenarios that are critical for UAS integration into the NAS, (iii) a process for risk modeling, planning, assessment, management, and communication utilizing multi-objective decision tree analysis, and (iv) recommendations for applying lessons learned from analyzing UAS integration to other components of NextGen. Whereas the results of this study are focused on UAS integration into the NAS, the methodological roadmap and modeling techniques adopted in this study are general enough to be applied to other systems-of-systems supported by MITRE Corporation. The results of this study are expected to help MITRE and the FAA navigate other NAS integration challenges and benefit from the political, social and ethical implications of UAS integration.},

Research was conducted to evaluate the Human Machine Interface (HMI) of UASs to analyze the ability for safe operation in the National Airspace System (NAS). More so, to evaluate a main vulnerability; lost link. The authors collected complex scenarios from ten experienced pilots through interviews, naturalistic observations and subject matter reviews to discover main issues regarding lost link. Data was evaluated using cognitive task analyses and gap analyses to compare with the current manned regulations.

abstract={Recently, several construction methods of highly nonlinear Boolean functions with relatively good algebraic properties were proposed. These approaches manage in optimizing most of the relevant cryptographic criteria, but not all of them at the same time. Usually, either the nonlinearity bounds are rather loose (though the actual nonlinearity is relatively high) or the functions do not provide a good resistance to fast algebraic cryptanalysis. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework for using objects in suitable projective geometry spaces for construction of highly nonlinear Boolean functions. This allows us to establish tight bounds on the nonlinearity using simple counting arguments, thus avoiding rather complicated estimates of certain trace sums. Our method generates a class of almost fully optimized functions, that is the functions apart from very high nonlinearity also have the maximum algebraic degree and optimal algebraic immunity. Compared to the classes of functions proposed by Carlet and Feng, Wang , and Zeng , our functions achieve a slightly better nonlinearity which is traded-off against a little worse resistance against fast algebraic attacks. On the other hand, compared to the functions by Tang and Tu and Deng, our nonlinearity is somewhat lower, but the algebraic properties are slightly better.},

Radar is currently the primary source of air traffic surveillance, with ADS-B poised to succeed radar leading into the FAA ADS-B Out mandate in 2020. WAM service could serve as both a transition to full ADS-B service and a cost-saving backup surveillance alternative to radar maintenance and expansion. One of the challenges associated with WAM is the accuracy of the aircraft's reported altitude. After engaging in a trade study to investigate various alternatives to correcting aircraft altitudes in a wide region for the FAA Colorado WAM Phase II program, Exelis determined that the aircraft altitude errors could be reduced significantly (less than 200') by integrating the Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) weather data grid generated by NOAA. The altitude correction trade study for WAM approach and results are discussed and analyzed.},

abstract={Beacon codes or squawk codes are a set of limited National Airspace System (NAS) resource. The Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRS) was deployed for civilian use by FAA after World War II. With the increase in demand for codes resulting from the growth in air traffic, the current system of beacon code allocation leads to code reassignments which are inefficient. Also, the current system is vulnerable to code shortages as the traffic grows. This paper describes a new algorithm of beacon code assignment that eliminates the need for “reassignment” and is also more scalable to increasing traffic in the NAS. The method, Space-Time Adjacency (STA) algorithm, assigns unique codes to flights by exploiting the temporal and spatial opportunities in individual flightplans. Five high traffic volume days across different seasons of 2007 were used to test the algorithm performance and robustness. The results show that this method of code assignment required zero reassignments.},

This study was designed to determine the impact of varying levels of intent information from IFR aircraft on the performance of AFR conflict detection and resolution. The study used Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) to supply IFR intent, but other methods such as an uplink from a ground-based System Wide Information Management (SWIM) network could alternatively supply this information. The independent variables of the study consist of the number of ADS-B trajectory change reports broadcast by IFR aircraft and the time interval between those reports. The conflict detection and resolution metrics include: the number of conflicts and losses of separation, the average conflict warning time, and the amount of time spent in strategic vs. tactical flight modes (i.e., whether the autoflight system was decoupled from the planned route in the Flight Management System in order to respond to a short-notice traffic conflict). The results show a measurable benefit of broadcasting IFR intent vs. relying on state-only broadcasts. The results of this study will inform ongoing separation assurance research and FAA NextGen design decisions for the sharing of trajectory intent information in the National Airspace System.},

abstract={Successful implementation of NextGen will require a critical mass of aircraft to be equipped with a range of avionics in the areas of communication, navigation, and surveillance. The equipage process has faced impediments that have slowed equipage rates below targets. It is believed that a package of financial and operational incentives can help accelerate the equipage process by incentivizing and facilitating the use of NextGen equipage. This paper focuses on Traffic Flow Management (TFM) Operational Incentives (OPIs) that can be implemented in the near-term. These incentives can help accelerate the equipage process by providing short-term benefits to early adopters until the full benefits of equipage materialize in the far term. Also, implementing equipage-aware Traffic Management Initiatives (TMIs) can enable near-term implementation of equipage-dependent concepts in a mixed-equipage environment. This, in turn, can reduce the airlines' uncertainty with respect to equipage return on investment. In this paper we conduct a high-level quantitative analysis to gain insight into the ramifications of TFM OPIs under a range of equipage levels.},

year={2012},
volume={},

pages={D6-1-D6-10},
abstract={Low altitude level flight segments increase fuel burn and emissions for the aircraft flying them. The number and length of level segments flown during arrival and departure operations can be reduced by procedure design which leverages the advantages of Area Navigation (RNAV) to reduce actual level flight. Such design must take into account many factors including terrain, current route of a particular flow of air traffic, other proximate air traffic flows, aircraft equipage, and air traffic control (ATC) needs. Variation of these factors between airports can make comparison difficult, whether between sites or over time. Recent studies, performed by The MITRE Corporation's Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD) on behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), have led to the development of a methodology for analyzing traffic flow vertical profiles for the purpose of reducing fuel burn and emissions in transition airspace. The methodology is flexible enough to be meaningfully applied to airports across the United States National Airspace System (NAS), while still having the specificity to reflect site specific vertical profile improvements. For example, in one recent study using this standardized methodology, over 4,000 traffic flows were identified for 48 airports across the NAS. Results were examined at the Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON), airport, flow, and individual segment level of detail, enabling support for national planning efforts as well as local procedure design. Results are typically reviewed in either a tabular format or in an interactive 3-D environment.},

abstract={In support of NextGen data communications applications, the FAA (Federal Aviation Authority) and the other ANSPs (Air Navigation Service Providers) plan to share the existing data radio currently used for supporting airline operations. Traditionally, ANSPs have operated all their communication in a relatively closed network environment. Air Traffic control data communications between the controller and the pilot; using existing Communication Service Provider (CSP) infrastructure over the existing data radio exposes the air traffic control message traffic to vulnerabilities in the network outside the ANSP domain. The use of shared radio and the ground infrastructure necessitates operation in a relatively open network environment where the ANSP network is interconnected with the CSP network which in turn is connected to airlines operations. Network hackers can probe for vulnerabilities in the network and launch a covert network attack at an appropriate time. While the air to ground communication security is subjected to collaborative standards evolution, there is a need to address the potential of distributed network attacks that may be launched from outside on the ground network. This paper explores potential vulnerabilities in the ground network, possible techniques to mitigate attacks, such as distributed denial of service attacks launched by hackers on the ground infrastructure outside the ANSP domain. The network attacks described in this paper are not restricted to data communications they are equally applicable to surveillance systems. The paper also explores the heightened possibility of penetrating the ANSP infrastructure firewall when network attacks are in progress.},

Data link performance such as successful reception probability in both surveillance and communication messages, and surveillance accuracy are examined in various operational conditions. Required SA performance is evaluated as a function of subsystem performance, using availability, continuity, and integrity metrics to establish overall required separation assurance performance, under normal and off-nominal conditions.

abstract={Current surveillance systems, in both aeronautical and maritime domains, are facing difficulties in dealing with non-cooperative objects, such as birds, weather, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs), malicious users, etc. Currently these non-cooperative objects are mostly viewed as clutter and, to avoid ambiguity for the human operator and/or subsequent analysis, are removed from the displayed data. However, as the environments that command and control systems operate in become increasingly complex, these objects potentially contain very valuable information that can be used to increase the safety, security, and reliability of the system. In this paper, we present models of current and projected future operations, and identify a series of use cases for the distribution of non-cooperative objects information deprived from enhanced surveillance technologies. Based on the models, use cases and possible operational scenarios, key human factor challenges for the use of this data are identified.},

abstract={Air traffic management (ATM) services are migrating towards a global seamless concept. This requires new thinking not only on the necessary operational changes but also on the technological paradigms that determine our current service architectures. Driven by the availability of more and more bandwidth within wide area ground networks new technologies are emerging such as Cloud Computing. Beyond that, operational concepts of FAA's NEXTGEN and Europe's SESAR include dynamically moving the responsibility for airspace blocks from one facility to another, and ensuring continuity of operation by providing contingency operations. This contribution assesses the applicability of cloud computing in ATM, and the key differences to existing commercial applications. It presents the technical cloud computing elements necessary to achieve a truly global ATM system and addresses harmonization and interoperability aspects such as standardized working procedures and controller working positions equipment for air traffic controllers. Situational awareness is key for the decision making process of controllers and pilots in NEXTGEN. A key element different to commercial cloud applications is the necessity to communicate with aircraft and pilots as cloud participants via narrowband VHF radio communications, SATCOM, or other wireless communications technologies. Situational awareness of these participants is paramount which, in the current system, is automatically provided due to the broadcast nature of voice transmissions from controllers and pilots that can be received and heard by all listeners on a particular frequency nearly simultaneously (propagation delay of the radio signal not considered). To efficiently manage the access to this shared media and limit the access only to “relevant” participants, the concept of ATC sector within a geographical area, with boundaries (horizontal and vertical) aligned with traffic patterns exists today. This paper describes mechanisms that demonstrate how SATCOM, VHF, and various data link technologies can be integrated into a service cloud by virtualizing the sector concept and relaxing or completely removing the dependence on the underlying communications media. The advantage of this concept is that sectors can be dynamically defined based on operational ATM service needs without having to adhere to the coverage limitations of the underlying telecommunications service. The current ATM system is severely limited by the underlying telecommunications service models, most often by programmatic and contractual issues rather than their technical nature. We introduce the concept of a multi-point service within a virtual sector taking into consideration operational NEXTGEN issues and demands related to capacity, performance, and global coverage. Finally we introduce a new communications service model where selected parts of the infrastructure can be selectively and partially outsourced to certified service providers. This concept allows for smoother transition between the existing and next generation technologies, and reduces cost for the taxpayer while maintaining the safety of the flights.},

abstract={Information sharing in the digital age is essential to providing a means to communicate faster and more efficiently. In aviation and air traffic management, communication is critical to daily operational coordination. At any given time there are multiple lines of communication that exist between pilots, air traffic controllers, airline operators, and other National Airspace System (NAS) users. In response to the growing need for better information sharing capabilities, the FAA has invested in a capability called System Wide Information Management (SWIM), a part of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). The primary focus of SWIM is to provide the right information to people when they need it. The SWIM program has been developing and implementing an information sharing infrastructure to provide data services to both internal FAA and external stakeholders. The current SWIM schedule calls for a phased deployment known as segments that build upon previously introduced capabilities and technologies. The FAA is currently in the planning and prototyping phase of segment two. While SWIM is developing and deploying new infrastructure and capabilities, research and development programs are looking at future applications of SWIM and new capabilities that can potentially assist users with getting access to better data in a more reliable manner. One example of this research and development is the Network Enabled Operations (NEO) program, which demonstrated potential future uses of SWIM in assisting in airspace coordination and traffic flow utilizing the planned segment two infrastructure. The purpose of this paper is to outline in high-level summary the deployment strategy and status of SWIM segment two and to highlight the research and development work accomplished by NEO over the past year.},

abstract={Trajectory Based Operations (TBO) will rely on “negotiated flight paths” to satisfy objectives of both individual users (expressed through their user preferred trajectories) and the whole system in an equitable and efficient manner to the fullest extent possible. Though there exist intensive research activities for in-flight, tactical trajectory coordination, relatively little work has been done on strategic pre-departure trajectory coordination. Herein, we focus on oceanic pre-departure coordination where there is often sufficient time in FAA controlled airspace to make adjustments to trajectories and smaller portions of the flight occur in the domestic environment where strategic trajectory coordination may be further away. The strategic nature of this coordination considers the potential contention along the entire flight time, accommodating random departure delay and planned changes through the pre-departure four-dimensional (4D) stochastic trajectory model. A series of capabilities will be required to allow a negotiation of flight profiles. The existing capability, the Dynamic Oceanic Track System Plus (DOTS Plus), only de-conflicts trajectory conflicts at the oceanic entry points without explicitly addressing the conflicts between aircraft trajectories beyond the oceanic entry points. We explore levels of coordination with enhanced insight for both the Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) and the airspace user. Based on the pre-departure 4D stochastic models previously developed, this paper aims to propose a framework and algorithms for storing data for congestion depiction, for creating a pre-departure plan, and for alerting users when a change in situation allows a previously denied request to be satisfied. Each of these capabilities takes into account potential contention and induced cost along the entire flight time of each individual trajectory.},

abstract={The proximity of satellite airports to primary airports increases airspace complexity resulting in all aircraft having to compete for constrained airspace. When passing through constrained airspace, aircraft need to be slowed down, leveled off, or vectored to avoid each other, leading to increases in flight delays, fuel burn and Air Traffic Control (ATC) workload. The MITRE Corporation's Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD) has developed a capability to identify and graphically display areas of constrained airspace. This capability provides a means to determine where procedural adjustments, particularly those which make use of PBN capabilities, could result in deconflicted and more efficient operations. A transparent and automated methodology was developed and the results from this capability are provided in both a tabulated and graphical format using the Keyhole Markup Language (KML), allowing the concepts to be easily communicated to a wide audience. This capability has been successfully applied at 48 airports across the National Airspace System (NAS) and the findings were reviewed positively by ATC subject matter experts.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) plans to modernize the National Airspace System (NAS) through the implementation of new capabilities in the form of procedures, avionics equipage, infrastructure improvements, and automation tools. Some of these capabilities are intended to address operational shortfalls associated with Air Traffic Control (ATC) operations in the Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) domain. This paper describes the methodology applied to TRACON ATC operations for identifying and ranking their shortfalls as well as capabilities that could address those shortfalls. The content in this paper is based upon work that the MITRE Corporation's Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD) has conducted in collaboration with the FAA to develop and adopt a strategy for addressing, ranking, and planning the implementation of new capabilities for terminal operations [1]. The methodology described in this paper includes an analysis of current shortfalls in the TRACON domain along with examples of capabilities intended to address these shortfalls. It also includes examples of the evaluation and ranking of these capabilities based on three key factors: relative value or benefit to operations; the feasibility or schedule achievability of the capability; and the amount of prerequisites the capability needs (e.g. new systems or system change). The paper presents examples of shortfalls and capabilities associated with the TRACON domain that resulted from the application of this methodology.},

pages={J2-1-J2-7},
abstract={The objective of this study was to investigate itinerary generation procedures and their effect on delay. In order for a National Airspace System (NAS) model to propagate delay, the flights within the demand set must be linked together. Currently, when modeling or analyzing the NAS, an analysis has two primary data sources to use in generating a demand set - ASQP and TFMS. Both of those datasets have their benefits and limitations. The ASQP dataset includes scheduled and actual flight data for scheduled nonstop passenger operations, as well as well as information about which aircraft operated a particular flight and causes of delay. However, the ASQP dataset only contains domestic flights operated by the largest U.S. carriers, currently only sixteen. The TFMS dataset contains a much larger set of flights, but does not contain a unique aircraft identifier or causes of delay. Linking individual flights is best done with a unique identifier. Because the ASQP dataset only contains domestic flights and the TFMS dataset does not include a unique aircraft identifier, tracking the daily movement of an aircraft becomes complicated. The ASQP recorded flights may suggest that an aircraft teleported from one airport to another or that it sat at an airport an unexpectedly long time, when the aircraft actually flew to an international destination and either moved on to another domestic airport (teleportation) or returned to the original airport (long aircraft turnaround time). Within this investigation, we developed a process for enhancing existing flight delay data by determining an appropriate aircraft tail numbers for domestic and international flight operations for a limited set of carriers. Our method uses a greedy algorithm to determine the possible international flights within the TFMS dataset that can fill the holes in the ASQP dataset created by a teleportation or a long sit time. We tested our process on one year of scheduled flights. We then compared the delay resulting from that set of itineraries with the delay resulting from a set of itineraries generated with a different methodology. The itineraries, generated using our new process, were more realistic than those generated with the other method. They also produced delays more similar to the actual delays.},

pages={K1-1-K1-13},
abstract={As new surveillance systems and sensor technologies are introduced to support enhancements to the air traffic control (ATC) infrastructure the need arises for a systematic evaluation of tracker algorithms. Ground automation systems use the surveillance data generated by multiple sensors in order to support critical ATC functions. To make the best use of the multi-sensor environment, tracker algorithms use different data fusion approaches with varying degrees of performance depending on how these algorithms are configured and fine tuned. Testing tracker performance, taking into account realistic sensor environments, requires an approach that includes four components: a) use of recorded live traffic to define realistic “ground truth” scenario data; b) target generation based on the desired sensor environment and with the inclusion of real-life target anomalies; c) definition of a set of `orthogonal' metrics and associated statistics that covers all aspects of tracker performance that are of operational relevance such as accuracy, stability, lag, track loss and track swap; d) automated computation of the metrics that compare tracker outputs with the a priori known “ground truth” in order to quantify tracker performance for statistically significant samples. In addition to providing a direct quantitative assessment of tracker performance, these metrics and the approach presented here can be used to perform meaningful comparison and ranking of tracker algorithms, validation of new systems using a legacy reference system, parameter tuning on ATC surveillance applications, system and regression tests, and support the development of system specifications. The tracker evaluation approach described here was used in the test program for the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) system, specifically to test the accuracy of ERAM's Surveillance Data Processor (SDP) subsystem. Sample results and the tools developed to implement the test approach are described.},

abstract={Standards are being developed for airport surface wireless networks. Such networks have been denoted as Airport Network and Location Equipment (ANLE) or Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System (AeroMACS). The term ANLE/AeroMACS will be used in this paper. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) plans to use portions of the 5000-5250 MHz band, including the 5091-5150 MHz subband, for the future implementation of ANLE/AeroMACS networks. When implemented, they must coexist with other radio-frequency (RF) systems operating in the same frequency band. The 5091-5150 MHz subband has also been allocated, on a co-primary basis, to non-geostationary mobile-satellite-service (MSS) feeder uplinks. Therefore, ANLE/AeroMACS networks need to meet the MSS RF interference (RFI) criterion identified by the ITU in order to coexist with MSS. The ANLE/AeroMACS network architecture is based on the IEEE 802.16-2009 standard, and uses a channel bandwidth of 5 MHz. To complement the initial 5-MHz scenario presented at the ICNS 2011 conference, additional scenarios are analyzed in this paper in order to more completely evaluate the impact of different 5-MHz channel configurations on ANLE/AeroMACS-to-MSS compatibility. These scenarios help determine the impact of various base station (BS) configurations and BS parameters. Our results show that, given the parameters of ANLE/AeroMACS networks and MSS feeder uplinks identified in the paper, the RFI criterion is met, and bandsharing between these systems is feasible.},

abstract={This paper describes the mobile application that has been developed at the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) Next-Generation ERAU Applied Research (NEAR) Laboratory. ERAU Multi Information Display (EMID) displays surveillance information based on Automatic dependency Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) standards used in FAA Next-Generation Air-Traffic Management (ATM). The initial version of the EMID was developed at the request of the ERAU flight department, for the purpose of monitoring the university fleet of over 75 ADS-B equipped aircraft. The later version of the EMID had incorporated additional functionalities to provide a platform for test and evaluation of new concepts in ATM and National Airspace (NAS) Usage. One of the advantages of the EMID is the use of SWIM (System Wide Information Management) like architecture, which allows the display of ADS-B and TIS-B aircraft position data received from SWIM-like surveillance services. ADS-B and TIS-B aircraft are represented by symbols that have optional data blocks capable of displaying altitude, speed, heading, and latitude/longitude information. EMID uses a different color coding scheme to distinguish between the commercial (blue) and general aviation (green) traffic. This color coding scheme has proven to make the product more user friendly, and reduce the overall workload of the user in identifying potential en-route conflicts. A mobile device version of the EMID called iEMID, has been developed using iOS [1] which can be deployed on iPhone and iPad devices. iEMID is a mobile Geographical Information System (GIS) based application capable of displaying geospatial referenced data. It supports pan and zoom and allows the user the capability to turn on/off different data layers. iEMID is capable of displaying high fidelity ESRI shape files of airspace volumes and airport layouts for precise tracking of aircraft while taxiing on the airport surface. This paper will concentrate on the overall functionality of the EMID and iEMID, and discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of the product. We will also discuss the supporting infrastructure that is needed to allow system functionality. For example, the ADS-B surveillance service hosted at the NEAR lab that manages several ground receivers.},

This implies greater data access and common situational awareness than presently available in the highly probabilistic models of current NAS non-critical systems and deterministic models of critical systems. The FAA can accelerate the opportunities promised by Next Gen by providing a modern infrastructure, suitable to enabling TBO. A critical requirement is the Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) enabling NAS stakeholder access and common situational awareness of NAS capacity and congestion realities, both present and predicted states. This system, a Common Trajectory Planning Resource (CTPR), should provide operators a common interface to trial plan potential trajectories against NAS constraints via automation with operator's NextGen flight planning and tracking systems. CTPR should also monitor and provide updates on the traffic flow impacts to filed flights and proposed trajectories allowing operators to identify and choose the most optimum solutions available based on their own unique business model and operations. Trajectories themselves, embodied in flight plans, represent an intersection of NAS stakeholder and ANSP interests. These interests must be brought into alignment for the realization of TBO benefits. Providing airspace users with access to a new, Common Trajectory Planning Resource model is a key to unlocking TOps/TBO benefits. The highest level of NAS benefits will accrue when optimization is left in the hands of the operators, and market forces are allowed to reward positive behavior. This empowerment of operators by the ANSP as well as common visibility among all parties also offers the opportunity for satisfaction of each operator's own business objectives and will accommodate the widest diversity of business rules and plans among an increasingly heterogeneous and dynamic community of operators.},

This formulation incorporates the IMC delay minutes for the purpose of modeling the effect of weather conditions in its objective function along with other performance metrics. The objective of the MIP formulation is to minimize the sum of differences between the sample averages and the full population averages. A variant of this formulation is also developed by adopting a weighting scheme based on the significance of IMC impact on the airports. Numerical results are reported and analyzed to show the effectiveness of this formulation and different choices of weighting schemes.

abstract={As NextGen concepts move toward increasing en route and terminal throughput, wake turbulence separation may become a limiting factor in the pursuit of capacity improvements. Better knowledge of the probable location of wakes (for air traffic controllers as well as pilots) could help provide safe separation from wake turbulence while avoiding unnecessary restrictions to operations. The Wake Turbulence Avoidance Automation (WTAA) research project, performed under MITRE's Mission Oriented Investigation and Experimentation (MOIE) work for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), demonstrated the use of existing FAA and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) wake turbulence research and algorithms to estimate wake characteristics given specific aircraft and meteorological data. This capability was used to drive displays of wake information on pilot Cockpit Displays of Traffic Information (CDTIs). This paper provides an overview of the existing FAA and NASA wake research that was leveraged and describes the development of the wake tool and the methods used to provide wake situational awareness to flight crews. Feedback obtained from the human in the loop (HITL) simulations is discussed and recommendations for further development and incorporation of FAA and NASA advances in wake research are provided. For one arrival procedure developed during the research, an analysis of the capacity impact at individual airports and an estimate of the system-wide delay impact of possible arrival procedures enabled by these wake tools is presented.},

abstract={This report describes the analysis of uplinked data received on board specially configured test aircraft as part of the Implementation System Test (IST) program for the Surveillance and Broadcast Services System (SBSS). One of the final phases of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) SBSS test program involves the flight of test aircraft in various regions of the National Airspace System (NAS) as the SBSS infrastructure is deployed. The MITRE Corporation's Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (MITRE/CAASD) has developed a recording and analysis toolset (referred to in this paper as the CAASD Analysis Toolset (CAT)) for flight data received on the Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) data link in order to assess the performance of the Traffic Information Service Broadcast (TIS-B), Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS B) Rebroadcast (ADS R), and Flight Information Service Broadcast (FIS B) segments of the SBSS. This paper is based on a sample of flight data obtained during the “IST East” flight test campaign covering most of the eastern United States (U.S.). Specific objectives for the CAT are the following: verifying proper Radio Station (RS) configuration, assessing uplink connectivity for FISB, assessing continuity of uplinked traffic tracks, and verifying FIS-B payload data received on the aircraft matches the copy provided to the FAA's monitor system. Background on the SBSS approach to the uplink services is presented, followed by an explanation of each of some of the analysis outputs generated.},

title={A Domain Specific Language for aviation domain interoperability},
year={2012},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-12},
abstract={The purpose of this work is to promote and advance interoperability between aviation information systems. Modern information systems require a flexible, scalable, and upgradeable infrastructure that allows communication, and collaboration, between heterogeneous information processing and computing environments. Aviation systems from different organizations often use differing representations and distribution policies for the same data and messages, limiting interoperability and collaboration. Although this problem is conceptually straightforward, information exchange is error prone, often dramatically underestimated, and unexpectedly complex. In the air traffic domain, complexity is often the result of the many different uncorrelated information processing environments that are used. The complexity and variation in information processing environments creates a barrier between domain practitioners and the engineers that build these systems. These divisions have contributed to documented systems failures such as the FAA's Advanced Automation System and the FBI's Virtual Case File. Operationally, difficulties in sharing information have contributed to significant coordination challenges between organizations. These coordination problems are evident in events such as the response to Hurricane Katrina, the Minneapolis over flight of October 2009, and other incidents requiring coordination between multiple organizations. To address interoperability in the aviation domain, a prototype Domain Specific Language (DSL) for aviation data will be designed and implemented. The DSL provides the capability to specify and create aviation data for use in the aviation domain. The DSL is designed to allow the domain practitioner to participate in dynamic information exchange without being burdened by the complexities of information technology and organizational policy. The DSL provides the capability to specify and generate information system usable representations of aviation data. The DSL makes use of an aviation metadata repository that contains the representational details of the aviation data. The combination of DSL, aviation metadata repository, and data generation provide the capability for aviation systems to interoperate, enabling collaboration, information sharing, and coordination.},

abstract={We present in this survey new technologies proposed for the evolution of the aeronautical communication infrastructure. Motivated by studies that estimate the growth of air traffic flow, it was decided to develop a future communication infrastructure (FCI) adapted to the future aeronautical scenario. The FCI development involves researchers, industrials, and aeronautical authorities from many countries around the world, and started in 2004. The L-band Digital Aeronautical Communication System (L-DACS) is the part of the FCI that will be in charge of continental communication. The L-DACS is being developed in Europe since 2007 and two candidates were preselected: L-DACS1 and L-DACS2. In this paper, we first describe the motivations of the FCI. We then give an overview of its development activities from 2004 to 2009. After that, we provide some insights about both preselected L-DACS candidates, at their physical and medium access layers. Finally, we address the challenges on the development of the FCI/L-DACS.},

title={Investigation of APNT optimized DME/DME network using current state-of-the-art DMEs: Ground station network, accuracy, and capacity},
year={2012},
volume={},
number={},
pages={146-157},
abstract={An optimized DME/DME network is one of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) proposed Alternative Position, Navigation, and Timing (APNT) architectures. In comparison to other FAA-proposed APNT architectures, namely DME pseudolite network and passive Wide-Area Multilateration, airline operators find DME/DME more attractive for navigation back-up, as this solution requires no change to avionics used by nearly all commercial aircraft, thus reducing equipage costs to private companies. It is also advantageous because the absolute DME range measurements likely require a lower number of stations than the other architectures, thereby minimizing the cost to the public of installing new infrastructure. However, the insufficient range accuracy of the traditional DME (DME/N) has caused hesitation in actively pursuing this solution. U.S. and ICAO DME range accuracy standards of 0.2 nm is insufficient to support RNAV/RNP 0.3 nm operations, the performance the FAA has defined as needed for APNT. However, these standards are based on antiquated DME designs and have failed to account for advancements in both aircraft and ground station radio designs and performance. Recent flight inspections of DME range determined that the accuracy of the current state-of-the-art DME (DME/N) ground transponder is much better than 0.2 nm using current-day DME avionics. This enhanced accuracy presents an opportunity to leverage this technology and the network of DME ground stations for APNT. The DMEs in most stations in the National Airspace System (NAS) have been in service for more than 20 years and are due for replacement. It is thought that replacing DME legacy radios with modern state-of-the-art DMEs could support RNAV/RNP 0.3 operations, as well as optimize coverage with minimal addition to the DME network. This supposition leads to the feasibility study of the proposed APNT optimized DME/DME network. Using the expected range accuracy of the state-of-the-art DMEs, this paper investigates the feasibility of this proposed APNT solution by answering the following two key questions. First, what would be the optimal DME/DME ground station network that enables RNAV/RNP 0.3 operation for navigation and surveillance? Second, will the DME/DME network have sufficient capacity to support high density air traffic such as the 2020 LA basin model? The paper provides preliminary research results, by evaluating selected areas of the continental United States. Recommendations for network operation are based on the sample areas.},

title={Enhanced Low Visibility Operations — Increasing flight operations services in the National Airspace System in low visibility conditions},
year={2012},
volume={},
number={},
pages={216-224},
abstract={Aircraft landing and taking off in low visibility is a critical area for aviation and the aviation industry. Flights can be cancelled, diverted, or delayed if aircraft cannot land or take off in low visibility. This impacts all users and stakeholders of the National Airspace System (NAS), including passengers. Low visibility can develop from weather or fog, causing air traffic to move from Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) to Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). During IMC, aircraft are under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) and only those aircraft that appropriately equipped with appropriately trained crews can continue operations. If aircraft could be equipped such that flight operations could continue for a longer period of time while conditions are worsening, more operations could continue to land rather than divert or take off rather than wait for conditions to improve. In a combined effort, and as part of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), the FAA is in the initial stages of implementing increased low visibility capabilities in an effort initiated and led by FAA Flight Standards and supported by Navigation Services. Prior to this work, Standard Category (CAT) I, CAT II, and CAT III were available. Minima are defined by the Runway Visual Range (RVR) system. New levels of service include take offs with a minimum as low as 500', as well as landing operations that include RVR 1800 (vice RVR 2400), Special Authorization (SA) CAT I, and SA CAT II. As will be discussed, this allows for advantages such as lower RVR-defined minima, lower Decision Altitude (DA), and for SA CAT II, lower life cycle costs for the infrastructure over the Standard CAT II services. The updates to FAA Order 8400.13, “Procedures for the Evaluation and Approval of Facilities for Special Authorization Category I Operations and All Category II and III Operations” allow for these additional categories of service. In an oversimplification, Flight Standards grants operational credit for equipage such as the Head Up Display (HUD) and Autoland so that such aircraft suitable equipped can continue with operations in conditions where other aircraft may have to be diverted. In many cases are obtained through publication of a new procedure, or in other cases may require some minimal ground infrastructure changes or enhancements, such as an additional Runway Visual Range (RVR) sensor or upgrade to the Instrument Landing System (ILS). What is arguably a particular advantage is that less lighting is required for these services.},

abstract={One of the most expensive and time-consuming activities of the software is locating the fault. Therefore, the software fault diagnosis technology and the Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SFL) is very significant to software quality assurance. Recently, the fault diagnosis technology based on the artificial intelligence theory attracts more and more attention. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have autonomy, intelligence and social ability, which is well-suited for diagnosing software systems, and which can easily be integrated with existing software testing schemes of software intensive equipment. In this paper, a kind of 4-layer Framework based on MAS for fault diagnosis is innovative presented. The proposed Framework is applied to real software diagnosis to validate its effectiveness.},

abstract={A novel active islanding detection method using d-axis disturbance signal injection with intelligent control is proposed in this study. The proposed active islanding detection method is based on injecting a disturbance signal into the system through the d-axis current which leads to a frequency deviation at the terminal of the RLC load when the grid is disconnected. The feasibility of the proposed method is evaluated under the UL1741 anti-islanding test configuration. The proposed d-axis disturbance signal injection method is intended to achieve a reliable detection with quasi zero non-detection zone (NDZ), minimum effects on power quality and easy implementation without additional sensing devices or equipments. Moreover, to further improve the performance of islanding detection method, a wavelet fuzzy neural network (WFNN) intelligent controller is proposed to replace the proportional-integral (PI) controller used in traditional injection method for islanding detection. Furthermore, the network structure and the on-line learning algorithm of the WFNN are introduced in detail. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed d-axis disturbance signal injection method is verified with experimental results.},

abstract={The potential use of multi-dimensional (MD) signal processing concepts and 1-D tunable bandpass filtering (BPF) for 2-D space-time (ST) spectrum sensing in a cognitive radio environment is proposed. The 2-D ST spectrum sensing allows the secondary users to search and detect white spaces along different spatial directions at a given time instance. This 2-D ST interrogation of the radio environment enables efficient sharing of primary frequency bands over multiple spatial directions in different instances of time. The use of frequency agile antennas is highlighted to mitigate interferences at known frequencies. Broadband/intermediate-frequency (IF) and analog/digital realizations of 2-D ST filters are proposed to perform the directional enhancement of signals. A low complexity highly-selective tunable 1-D digital BPF is proposed to be used with energy detection to perform spectral sensing along the required direction in space. The tunable BPF eliminates the need of computationally intensive high resolution FFT for frequency scanning. A prototype FPGA implementation of the BPF operating at 66 MHz is used to study the effect of finite precision arithmetic with a word length of 8 bits.},

pages={1688-1695},
abstract={This paper proposes a solution to air traffic control (ATC) using an enhanced SIMD machine model called an Associative Processor (AP). Our solution differs from previous ATC systems that are designed for MIMD computers and have a great deal of difficulty meeting the predictability requirements for ATC, which are critical for meeting the strict certification standards required for safety critical software components. The proposed AP solution supports accurate predictions of worst case execution times and guarantees all deadlines are met. Furthermore, the software developed based on the AP model is much simpler and smaller in size than the current corresponding ATC software. As the associative processor is built from SIMD hardware, it is considerably cheaper and simpler than the MIMD hardware currently used to support ATC. We have designed a prototype for eight ATC real-time tasks on Clear Speed CSX600 accelerator that is used to emulate AP. Performance is evaluated in terms of execution time and predictability and is compared to the fastest host-only version implemented using OpenMP on an 8-core multiprocessor (MIMD). Our extensive experiments show that the AP implementation meets all deadlines that can be statically scheduled. To the contrary, some tasks miss their deadlines when implemented on MIMD. It is shown that the proposed AP solution will support accurate and meaningful predictions of worst case execution times and will guarantee that all deadlines are met.},

abstract={A novel approach to find optimal real power generation pattern will be introduced in this study. This has been achieved by maximizing the power system voltage stability margin and minimizing generation cost. The loadability limit index is used to assess static voltage stability security margin. Based on proposed algorithm, a Toolbox has been developed to recognize the loadability limit by using Lagrangian method. The mentioned problem has been modeled as a non-linear and multi objective optimization problem along with Hybrid Genetic Algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization (HGAPSO) method to reach the optimal generation pattern. The method has been performed as a hierarchical optimization problem. In the first stage, HGAPSO method has been used to reach the securest pattern of real power. Also, mentioned voltage stability toolbox has been executed to evaluate the voltage stability margin respectively each real power generation pattern during HGAPSO search. These simulations are performed on IEEE 30 bus test system. To validation of proposed method, obtained results have been compared with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) results.},

year={2012},

pages={580-585},
abstract={Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology that enables the non-contact, automatic and unique identification of objects using radio waves. Its use for commercial applications has recently become attractive with RFID technology seen as the replacement for the optical barcode system that is currently in widespread use. RFID has many advantages over the traditional barcode and these advantages have the potential to significantly increase the efficiency of decentralised business environments such as logistics and supply chain management. One of the important features of an RFID system is its ability to search for a particular tag among a group of tags. In order to ensure the privacy and security of the tags, the search has to be conducted in a secure fashion. To our knowledge not much work has been done in this secure search area of RFID. The limited work that has been done does not comply with the EPC Class-1 Gen-2 standards since most of them use expensive hash operations or sophisticated encryption schemes that cannot be implemented on low-cost passive tags that are highly resource constrained. Our work aims to fill this gap by proposing a serverless ultra-lightweight secure search protocol that does not use the expensive hash functions or any complex encryption schemes but achieves compliance with EPC Class-1 Gen-2 standards while meeting the required security requirements. Our protocol is based on XOR encryption and random numbers - operations that are easily implemented on low-cost RFID tags. Our protocol also provides additional protection using a blind-factor to prevent tracking attacks. Since our protocol is EPC Class-1 Gen-2 compliant it makes it possible to implement it on low-cost passive RFID tags.},

abstract={The influence of the systems architecture on the functions and other properties of embedded systems makes its high level analysis and verification very desirable. EASTADL is an architecture description language dedicated to automotive embedded system design with focus on structural and functional modeling. The behavioral description is not integrated within the execution semantics, which makes it harder to transform, analyze, and verify EAST-ADL models. Model-based techniques help to address this issue by enabling automated transformation between different design models, and providing means for simulation and verification. We present a way of integrating architectural models and verification techniques, which has been implemented in a tool called ViTAL. Consequently, ViTAL provides the possibility to express the functional EAST-ADL behavior as timed automata models, which have precise semantics and can be formally verified. The ViTAL tool enables the transformation of EASTADL functional models to the UPPAAL PORT tool for model checking. This method improves the verification of functional and timing requirements in EAST-ADL, and makes it possible to identify dependencies and potential conflicts between different vehicle functions before the actual AUTOSAR implementation.},

Then we identified the critical target object for value computation. Hence after we propose a calculation mechanism of service value and added value for situations including data as a service (DaaS), information as a service (FaaS), composition scenarios, optimization and their mix with usage explanations.

abstract={In the real world applications, the most widely used simple-and-small smart device is most likely the ticket of the metropolitan railway transit (MRT). Behind this simple-and-small device, IC-card or RFID token, very large and complicated system is required to facilitate such a smart device. MRT is typically of a distributed environment. MRT's primary purpose is transporting massive passengers, and thus, employs huge volume of distributed fare collections. Development (i.e., scale) of a MRT takes decades to mature, and due to different passes (tickets) may be offered for various travel needs, legacy systems may coexist for certain periods of time, and multiple fare collection methods may be utilized, such that integration of versatile vendors and applications becomes necessary. This paper presents a successful implementation of a web-based distributed integrated fare collection and accounting (IFCA) system in Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation. Such an IFCA system contains more than 1,200 program modules with million lines of source code. The architectural and engineering, as well as management and maintenance, issues will be addressed. The IFCA system replicates application programs and databases for each train station. It is proven robust, scalable, and lower cost. It may be served as a reference model for the existing and currently under building MRTs.},

abstract={Fault detection and isolation (FDI) have become one of the most important aspects of automobile design. Fault detection and isolation for engine open loop system was investigated in many research. In fact, the simulation results obtained from engine open loop system do not reflect the real situation for automotive engine. In the practice the engine works as closed-loop control system. In this paper, a new FDI scheme is developed for automotive engines under closed-loop control system. Test the method using closed-loop system has been done. The method uses an independent radial basis function (RBF) neural network model to model engine dynamics, and the modeling errors are used to form the basis for residual generation. Furthermore, another RBF network is used as a fault classifier to isolate occurred fault from other possible faults in the system. The performance of the developed scheme is assessed using an engine benchmark, the Mean Value Engine Model (MVEM) with Matlab/Simulink. Six faults have been simulated on the MVEM, including four sensor faults, one component fault and one actuator fault. The simulation results show that all the simulated faults can be clearly detected and isolated in dynamic conditions throughout the engine operating range.},

Moreover, to achieve the required control performance and to maintain the stability of a six-phase PMSM drive system under faulty condition, the TSKFNN-AMF control, which combines the advantages of a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang type fuzzy logic system and an asymmetric membership function, is developed. The network structure, online learning algorithm using a delta adaptation law, and convergence analysis of the TSKFNN-AMF are described in detail. Furthermore, to enhance the control performance of the proposed intelligent fault-tolerant control, a 32-bit floating-point digital signal processor TMS320F28335 is adopted for the implementation of the proposed fault-tolerant control system.

However, in some of the most dangerous RI scenarios the surveillance providing the input for the automatic control of the signals reaches its limitations. The necessary surveillance accuracy needed to deal with such scenarios could be achieved by localized sensors. Therefore this work provides a comparative analysis of surveillance performance in a very dangerous RI scenario based on the experimental RIPAS design XL-RIAS.},

abstract={Dental radiographs have been widely used by dentists in finding periodontal lesions or monitoring the progress of the periodontal defect treatment that is either impossible or difficult for human naked eyes. In this paper we propose a fully automatic gums lesion detection method for periapical dental X-ray images. The method includes two stages: (i) teeth- parts removing and (ii) lesion-region localization and severance labeling. In stage (i), morphological operations and histogram equalizations are first applied to enlarge the contrast between teeth and gums parts, then thresholding is used to separate the two types of regions. In stage (ii), gums-parts are first segmented into regions of normal, possible lesion or lesion, and serious lesion using a level set method with three coupled level set functions, and then the possible lesion or lesion region are further segmented into lesion and possible lesion regions using the same level set method. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can detect and label all lesion regions in six periapical dental X-ray images which conform very well to human visual perception, and is robust to illumination variation to ± 30 intensity levels, as well.},

year={2012},

pages={2716-2730},
abstract={The objective of this study is to develop an intelligent nonsingular terminal sliding-mode control (INTSMC) system using an Elman neural network (ENN) for the threedimensional motion control of a piezo-flexural nanopositioning stage (PFNS). First, the dynamic model of the PFNS is derived in detail. Then, to achieve robust, accurate trajectory-tracking performance, a nonsingular terminal sliding-mode control (NTSMC) system is proposed for the tracking of the reference contours. The steady-state response of the control system can be improved effectively because of the addition of the nonsingularity in the NTSMC. Moreover, to relax the requirements of the bounds and discard the switching function in NTSMC, an INTSMC system using a multi-input-multioutput (MIMO) ENN estimator is proposed to improve the control performance and robustness of the PFNS. The ENN estimator is proposed to estimate the hysteresis phenomenon and lumped uncertainty, including the system parameters and external disturbance of the PFNS online. Furthermore, the adaptive learning algorithms for the training of the parameters of the ENN online are derived using the Lyapunov stability theorem. In addition, two robust compensators are proposed to confront the minimum reconstructed errors in INTSMC. Finally, some experimental results for the tracking of various contours are given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed INTSMC system for PFNS.},

abstract={With the embrace of cellular telecommunication in Nigeria, the sector has experienced tremendous growth in terms of users. There have also been advances in technology from 2G to 3G and even 4G networks. Irrespective of the network in use, there is a section that is yet to have an alternative which is the base transceiver station BTS of the cellular network. This paper looks at the role of the BTS location on service delivery and hence customer's satisfaction in cellular networks. A survey is carried out in five major cities in Nigeria to have a professional insight into the challenges/difficulties faced by network providers in the placement of base stations. Results from this investigation reveal topography and land use problems as major challenges to the optimal placement of base stations, hence limiting coverage optimization efforts. This study provides necessary variables for the development of a tool for optimal placement of base station in order to achieve optimized radio coverage.},

abstract={Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems (TAWS) are on-board systems that alert crews to imminent Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT). Originally required by the FAA in 1974 for all Part 121 aircraft, this technology has advanced to include GPS data, terrain and obstacle databases, and sophisticated flight deck displays to provide increasingly accurate and timely alerts. TAWS equipment is capable of generating a set of audible and visual alerts based on the most likely situations which lead to a high risk of CFIT. These include excessive descent rates, excessive vertical deviation from an Instrument Landing System (ILS) glideslope, proximity to terrain with landing gears up, and descent immediately following a takeoff. Although the incident rate of CFIT has been greatly reduced over the past few decades, areas of risk still exist, typically near small airports surrounded by mountainous terrain. Risk also remains due to economic factors. The high cost of hardware and software upgrades delays the universal adoption of the most advanced TAWS equipment. Older equipment is much more likely to generate nuisance alerts - warnings to the crew during periods of low CFIT risk. These nuisance alerts desensitize crews to TAWS, leading to situations where crews may ignore or not fully respond to alerts that indicate real danger. Separately, FAA NextGen efforts are driving major redesigns of airspaces and procedures across the country. The primary factors in redesign focus on minimizing the costs associated with delay and fuel burn; however, these redesigns must also ensure that changes do not introduce new CFIT risks. Current practices depend on incomplete evidence to determine that risk has not increased. The continued elimination of remaining CFIT risk, along with the possibility of introducing new risk during redesign, necessitate a comprehensive TAWS model to understand current and potential hazards. Without a TAWS model to provide rapid feedback during simulated design changes, several months may pass before observing that a design change has increased CFIT risk. In this paper, we describe the construction and validation of a standards-based TAWS model to capture the behavior of a variety of equipment. This paper also describes a process for measuring the effect of procedure redesign on TAWS alert rates. Finally, we include a case study of analyzing approaches into the airport at Eagle, CO - the airport with the highest TAWS alert rates in the country. In this case study, we find that equipment upgrades would eliminate nuisance alerts for aircraft using currently published approach procedures.},

pages={2D2-1-2D2-13},
abstract={The authors propose a de-cluttering technique to simplify the depiction of visually complex Area Navigation (RNAV) and Required Navigation Performance (RNP) procedures by reducing the number of paths shown on a single chart page. An experiment was conducted to determine whether charts with fewer paths (“Modified charts”) allow improved access to information in terms of time and accuracy compared with charts that are currently used (“Current charts”). Data were collected from 28 airline and 19 corporate pilots. Results show that pilot response times were significantly improved with the Modified charts. For approach procedures, the mean response time was 16.9 seconds for Current charts and 10.7 seconds for Modified charts. For departure procedures, the mean response time was 16.2 seconds for Current charts and 13.2 seconds for Modified charts. This difference in response time between Current and Modified charts was consistent across the different procedures (approach and departure), pilot types (Airline and Corporate), and chart manufacturers (FAA and Jeppesen) included in the study. Additionally, pilots answered questions correctly 99.5% of the time with no difference in response accuracy between Current and Modified charts. Note, this experiment only evaluated the potential benefit of separating paths across multiple pages and did not explore the drawbacks to this de-cluttering technique.},

title={Prediction of weather impacted airport capacity using RUC-2 forecast},

pages={3C3-1-3C3-12},
abstract={Weather induced airborne delays have caused significant problems at the major commercial airports in the United States. Using Rapid Updated Cycle forecast data (RUC-2), this paper presents real case studies for assessing the impact of weather on airport capacities by Quadratic Response Surface (QRS) linear regression models and ensemble Bagging Decision Tree regression (BDT) models. Three high-demand major airports: Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD), and Atlanta International Airport (ATL) were selected for the analysis. Both QRS and BDT models were developed and evaluated using the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aviation System Performance Metrics (ASPM) data and RUC-2 weather forecasts for these airports. The performances of the two weather impacted airport capacity models were compared and the errors between estimates and observations of airport arrival rates (AAR) were evaluated. The accuracy of AAR predictions in several hour look-ahead times using RUC-2 forecast weather was examined. The experimental results show that the accuracies of AAR estimations by nonlinear BDT regression models are much better than that from QRS multiple linear regression models. With airport AAR BDT models, the errors on weather corresponding AAR estimates using RUC weather data are smaller than that by METAR surface weather observations. Considering RUC includes much more weather information than METAR does, these findings strongly suggest that the adverse weather impact on airport capacity is complicated, relies on many predicting variables carried by RUC and it is inherently nonlinear. As a consequence, by using RUC weather forecasts, root mean squared error (RMSE) of the airport AAR BDT model predictions at one-hour look-ahead time are less than one and two arrival aircrafts per quarterly-hour for EWR and ORD/ATL airport, respectively. The ratio between AAR RMSE and average AAR for AAR predictions at one to eight hour look-ahead time is less than 10% for all three airports with nonlinear BDT models using RUC-2 weather forecasts. These results appear to be reasonably good.},

abstract={Current storage and retrieval of air traffic management data by the FAA allows for sufficient control of aircraft flows in the National Airspace System. However, these storage methods allow neither for deep historical analysis nor for use of advanced, standards-compliant tools. Another shortcoming of these storage methods is that air traffic management data are not readily accessible by all interested parties. The contributions of this paper are a new approach to describing, storing, and serving air traffic management data, and its software implementation. This approach is compliant with relevant published standards and, therefore, is easily incorporated into current and future systems. We fully develop a schema for describing reroute advisories, implement a database based upon that schema, then implement an example tool that can use this new system to provide information in a way not possible in the current system. This schema is an extension of the Aeronautical Information Exchange Model and allows for geometric queries to databases based upon the model. The example tool uses this feature by requesting previously implemented reroutes that do not intersect a supplied region of interest. The results enable a traffic manager to base a new reroute on past decisions of all traffic managers, which is not an approach used today. In today's operations, the sharing of past decisions between traffic managers given similar situations is not a formal process. The disconnect between what various managers might implement leaves room for inefficiencies in the system and helps motivate this study. As an example of the potential benefits of the system described here, there was a savings over 1000 nmi in total flight distance over all flights affected by a particular reroute advisory.},

abstract={An overarching goal of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) and the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) is to improve predictability of the air traffic system as a whole in order to increase capacity and efficiency while maintaining safety and incorporating user preferences. The achievement of these goals requires tight integration of new technologies and adjustments to operational procedures as envisioned in Trajectory Based Operations. This paper presents a concept that directly integrates the trajectory generated by the aircraft's Flight Management System with air traffic management operations. The concept is an application of the principles of self-organization (swarm theory) where safety and traffic flow management goals are achieved by broadcasting all the operational constraints on a 4D-Grid and populating the grid with the 4D-trajectories of all other flights. As new flights get added to the system the remaining capacity is in full view to prospective operators who will be able to plan flights using available capacity. The paper shows how self-organized air traffic leads to optimality, provides details of the concept, describes near term implementation strategies and explores long term implications.},

abstract={Q-routes are high altitude Area Navigation (RNAV) airway routes designed to provide more direct routing compared to conventional routes and allow creation of parallel routes where a single route existed before. Such direct routes improve airspace capacity and relieve congestion while reducing direct operating expenses, such as fuel costs, to the flight operator. As part of the Next Generation Air Transport System (NextGen), the Federal Aviation Administration is rapidly expanding the use of Q-routes all over the National Airspace (NAS) starting with the most congested airspaces. Though the concept of Q-routes is simple and straightforward, the actual gains in efficiency are strongly influenced by the availability and choice of approach route in the arrival transition airspace. Certain combinations of Q-routes with Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STARs) and final approach routes could lead to suboptimal efficiency gains that reduce the overall efficiency of a flight. This paper compares the efficiency of Q-routes with several choices of approach routes, for Q-routes from the Washington SEATAC area to the San Francisco TRACON. Additionally, the paper investigates the efficiency of direct routing from Atlanta to the Fort Lauderdale area.},

pages={4C1-1-4C1-12},
abstract={A conflict detection and resolution tool, Terminal Tactical Separation Assurance Flight Environment (T-TSAFE), is being developed to improve the accuracy and reduce the false alert rate beyond currently deployed technology. The legacy system in use today, Conflict Alert, relies primarily on a dead reckoning algorithm. By adding altitude intent information for conflict detection and resolution, T-TSAFE may improve conflict detection accuracy. In addition to verifying T-TSAFE's efficacy over Conflict Alert, an initial human-in-the-loop study suggested possible avenues of tool improvement through heuristic analysis. Results of this analysis were then used to guide a follow-up T-TSAFE investigation, which is described in this paper. This follow-up study tested four experimental conditions. The first two conditions varied conflict detection with and without altitude clearances entered into the tool by the controllers via keyboard. The other two conditions varied the presence of Automatic Terminal Proximity Alert (ATPA), an FAA tool used for monitoring final approach [1]. One of these final approach conditions used regular alerts in the data block without cones and the others used ATPA cones between different aircraft (i.e., a cone graphic shown in the flight display) as a warning for possible compression errors in the final approach. Entering altitude clearances into T-TSAFE was expected to reduce false alerts but did not, possibly due to the short duration of the runs, which did not allow for a large enough frequency of altitude entries to study the issue adequately. Also, the test conditions did not significantly impact the duration of the alert or the controller's response time to the alert. The subjective data showed that controllers favored the ATPA cones over the T-TSAFE alerts in the data blocks on final approach. Results also indicate manageable levels of workload and situation awareness, which combined with other results, seem to indicate promise for T-TSAFE as a viable air traffic control tool, pending further research and adaptation.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) leverages aircraft avionics to deliver beneficial communications, navigation, and surveillance capabilities. The avionics and enabled capabilities vary among aircraft and the resulting mixed capability environment presents challenges to air traffic control operations and, by extension, NextGen planning and implementation. The MITRE Corporation's Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (MITRE/CAASD) applies a data-driven approach to understanding the mixed capability environment, both current and forecast. While all aircraft are important to the success of NextGen and understanding the mixed capability environment, this paper focuses on the fleet of aircraft operated under Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 121 authorization and the specific capabilities defined in the NextGen Implementation Plan, Appendix A. This paper describes the avionics and capabilities of this fleet and discusses the expected impact of the mixed capability environment on the National Airspace System (NAS).},

title={Hybrid APNT architecture using DME/DME and multilateration},

pages={5A5-1-5A5-10},
abstract={DME/DME and Passive Wide Area Multilateration (P-WAM) are two proposed FAA's Alternative Position, Navigation, and Timing (APNT) architectures that provide navigation and surveillance capability to National Air Space during a GNSS outage. Although Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) and Multilateration (MLAT) system operate in a very different way, they use the same frequency band and can share the same antenna, which allows for one system integrating DME and MLAT electronics. Similarly, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) can be integrated with DME and MLAT. This DME/MLAT/ADS-B integrated system in one cabinet can be used to simultaneously provide DME and MLAT service for navigation and ADS-B for surveillance. With this dual navigation service capability of the integrated system, it is possible to develop a hybrid APNT architecture enabling both of DME/DME and P-WAM service as a back-up of GNSS. The important advantage of the hybrid architecture is that the impacts on the avionics of General Aviation users and commercial jet airliners would be minimal by requiring only software and additional input/output connections. This paper describes the methodology and results for the feasibility study of the hybrid architecture and investigates the required ground station layout of the hybrid architecture that meets the anticipated APNT navigation and surveillance performance requirements by evaluating selected areas of the continental U.S. The required ground network will be determined through an optimization process called Coverage Analysis Method [1, 2] and be compared with the respective required ground networks for DME/DME and P-WAM based architectures to evaluate the additional number of ground stations needed in the hybrid architecture. In addition, the capacity of the DME/MLAT/ADS-B integrated systems in the hybrid architecture will be evaluated.},

title={Analysis of advanced flight management systems (FMSS), flight management computer (FMC) field observations trials: Standard instrument departure with radius-to-fix (RF) path terminators},

abstract={At the request of The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the differences in performance of various manufacturers' Flight Management Systems (FMSs) and their associated Flight Management Computers (FMCs) have been a focus of research by these authors at The MITRE Corporation since 2004. While published Area Navigation (RNAV) and Required Navigation Performance (RNP) procedures and routes are designed according to criteria contained in FAA orders, FMC manufacturers design their systems in accordance with Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards (MASPS) and Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for area navigation systems, Technical Standards Orders (TSOs), Advisory Circulars (AC's), and industry characteristics. Because procedure designers may not consider FMS functional characteristics, differences may occur between the intent of a procedure design in accordance with FAA orders and the actual path produced and flown by an aircraft's FMC. Exposing such differences is a derivative of MITRE's research. However, the primary purpose is to research and demonstrate variations in performance of individual FMS products. Another goal of this work is to provide supporting data for the development of instrument procedures where aircraft operations meet expectations for repeatability and predictability to levels of performance sufficient to support Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) worldwide and specifically in the National Airspace System (NAS) and the Next Generation (NextGen) environment. Sometimes, due to the nearly independent development of procedure design criteria and aircraft performance standards, the paths of various aircraft on the same procedure do not coincide and may not match the intent of the procedure designer. This paper explores those paths and complements six previous studies, the first conducted in 2006, (all presented at previous Digital Avionics System Conferences) with the basic title of Analysis of Advanced Flight Management Systems (FMSs), FMC Field Observations Trials. The previous studies have shown that the flight path differences may result from any or all of the following: variations in FMC equipment installed on the aircraft; variations and errors in procedure coding in the FMC navigation database; variations in aircraft to FMC interface and associated aircraft performance capabilities; and variations in flight crew training and procedures. The hypothesis common to all of these papers has been that the FMCs built by the major avionics manufacturers and installed as the core of the FMC/FMS combinations in various airframe platforms will perform differently and each paper has attempted to quantify those differences. This paper explores path adherence of radius-to-fix (RF) leg types (path terminators) in a Standard Instrument Departure (SID). At the time of the trial development in December 2011, the RNAV departure from Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport (EHAM) titled SPIJKERBOOR SPY2KZ Runway 24 Departure was the only public SID that incorporated RF leg types in the design. Subsequent to the initiation of this study, another public SID with RF legs was published in February 2012 at Hong Kong International (VHHH). As airspace becomes more complex, the use of RF legs in other than RNP Authorization Required (AR) procedures such as SID's, Standard Terminal Arrivals (STAR) and non-AR approaches will become increasingly more important as a tool to navigate obstacle rich and environmentally sensitive areas. The FAA has not approved operators to fly procedure designs with RF legs without RNP AR. However, consideration is being given to implementing an "Advanced RNP" concept which would allow RF leg types under certain restrictions. Criteria exists for RF legs in SID's and FAA AC 90-105, [1] addresses RF leg types in non-AR RNP approach procedures. Additionally, the use of RF leg types is encouraged as a key enabler of Performance-based Navigation (PBN) in the FAA [2]. This paper investigates the use of RF legs in departures by testing how FMCs process curved paths with small arc radii close to the departure end of the runway (DER) while accelerating and ascending in various wind conditions. Controlled field observations trials were made using seventeen FMC avionics test benches at seven major FMC manufacturers and four high fidelity flight simulators at three major airlines. The focus on the subject presented follows The MITRE Corporation's previous analysis of manufacturers' FMC lateral navigation (LNAV), vertical navigation (VNAV), radius-to-fix (RF) path conformance on instrument approaches, lateral and vertical path integration, RNAV off the ground SID's, and RNAV holding. This report contributes data, analysis, conclusions and recommendations to industry and the FAA that may influence criteria development to enhance performance-based RNAV and RNP operations. It has been confirmed in previous papers and reconfirmed here that despite FMS differences, the resulting aircraft path performance is generally within the tolerances of the procedure design requirements identified in the FAA criteria.},

abstract={Area navigation (RNAV) and required navigation performance (RNP) are key components of performance-based navigation (PBN). Instrument procedures that use RNAV and RNP can have more flexible and precise paths than conventional routes that are defined using ground-based navigation aids. As a result, RNAV and RNP routes can enhance operational safety, efficiency, and access. At the United States Department of Transportation Volpe Center, we are identifying and documenting human factors issues associated with implementing PBN instrument procedures for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This effort supports the FAA's transition to the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) by providing recommendations to promote easier and more reliable use of PBN instrument procedures. In this paper, we explain why human factors research is needed and provide examples of research issues. For example, new procedures may result in increased visual complexity of charts, which in turn could increase pilot workload and the potential for error. We are also conducting analyses and experiments to understand and improve the usability of aeronautical charts for PBN instrument procedures. Our work in this area is summarized in this paper. More information can be found at www.volpe.dot.gov/coi/hfrsa/ahf/ip/library.html. The website has links to our latest research products. It also supports other human factors research teams by listing and summarizing publicly available reports on related topics.},

abstract={There have been many improvements and changes in the technology, design features, and displays for forward-looking turbulence and windshear, weather, and ground mapping pulsed radar systems. The paper summarizes the issues of forward-looking turbulence and windshear radars and the airworthiness design approval of these systems as they relate to [1]. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued TSO-C63d as the minimum performance standard for forward-looking turbulence and windshear, weather and ground mapping pulsed radar equipment. TSO-C63d addresses receiver/transmitter, processor, antenna, control, and range, including annunciation and detection performance for forward-looking turbulence and windshear systems. For forward-looking turbulence systems, TSO-C63d addresses detection performance probabilities common to three aircraft wing loading classes. The detection performance probability criteria were validated in National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Flight Tests of the Turbulence Prediction and Warning System (TPAWS) Program. The TSO provides procedures and alternatives for analysis and simulation verification of the turbulence detection performance in various turbulence wind field conditions. The TSO does not address hazard threshold setting requirement for forward-looking turbulence detection performance. For short range and long range forward-looking windshear systems, TSO-C63d addresses detection performance probabilities regarding windshear F-factor, and hazard threshold for caution, warning, and advisory alerts. These detection performance probability and alert criteria were validated in the NASA/FAA Airborne Windshear Program. The TSO also provides procedures for analysis and simulation verification of the windshear detection performance in various windshear and operating conditions.},

abstract={Accurately assessing capability maturity is an important practice for reducing costs, time to production, and adverse events for any system development activity [1]. This was as true for the vacuum-tube avionics of the early 20th century as it is for today's enterprise digital systems. Within the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) program, an accurate assessment of capability maturity is crucial to successfully transfer concepts and software technology from one organization to another throughout concept development and acquisition phases. This paper describes the current status of an ongoing effort to develop a new maturity assessment framework for automation technology concepts and their related capabilities. The purpose of the new framework is to collect, organize, and report information about the maturity of technology concepts and capabilities. The information that is organized through this analysis identifies specific areas where additional design and validation efforts would be most fruitful. Specifically, the framework seeks to indicate what has been done, under what conditions, with what results. By doing this, the framework identifies what specific components need further development. The new framework also aims to allow the comparison of results across capabilities or time frames, as well as being applicable to a variety of programs within the FAA or other government agencies.},

abstract={The Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) initiative intends to accommodate significantly higher levels of air traffic volume with greater safety and efficiency through the extensive use of enabling data exchanges. Data link communications will replace voice communications between aircraft and air traffic management systems to improve the accuracy and timeliness of information exchanged. These data exchanges will enable pilots, air traffic managers, and dispatchers to use the same data sets in their decision-making processes. The long-term NextGen goal is collaborative decision-making enabled by machine-to-machine information sharing. While the technical challenges of providing data to cockpits are being addressed across the community, the software architectures and functionality needed to ensure the data is current, authoritative, and consistent are still being defined.

abstract={The routine integration of unmanned aircraft into non-segregated civil airspace is important to enable a number of current and proposed applications ranging from military and homeland security to a wide variety of research and eventually commercial purposes. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is currently undertaking a comprehensive overhaul of the National Airspace System (NAS) known as Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). NextGen will include increased automation systems for both terminal and en-route Air Traffic Control (ATC). Improvements in two-way data communication links between aircraft and ATC will facilitate the use of such automation systems. The robust integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into NextGen automation systems is an integral component to meeting the far-term (2018+) NextGen vision. By determining how UAS flight operations and protocols may be different than those of traditional manned aircraft, informed decisions can be made concerning the data and interfaces required to accommodate routine UAS operations by NextGen automation systems, ultimately leading to safer and more efficient integration of UAS into non-segregated civil airspace. This paper describes many of the challenges associated with such accommodation as well as proposed solutions to address these challenges based upon construction of prototype interfaces using established UAS communication standards and envisioned ATC automation interfaces. Enhanced data formats, communication protocols and algorithms are also researched and discussed.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and supporting organizations are developing new concepts to improve efficiency and safety of the National Airspace System (NAS). Some of these concepts change current restrictions, introduce new maneuvers, or provide better decision support to air traffic controllers. Each of these concepts requires extensive research and validation before it can be integrated into the NAS. Many different analysis tools are used to determine benefits, limitations, and requirements of these concepts. Some of these tools provide statistical metrics of the concepts, while others show the concepts visually. However, many of these are specialized tools built specifically for analyzing one concept or a small subset of concepts in a specific region of the NAS. When a new concept is introduced, it is often difficult to find a tool that can easily be adapted to help analyze it. The Concept Analysis Branch at the FAA is tasked with analyzing many of these concepts for feasibility and benefits determination before requirements development occurs. In order to assist in this task, the Concept Analysis Branch has developed a flexible, extensible, interactive 4D visualization tool for analysis of virtually any aviation concept. Flexible Flight Traffic Exploration Visualization 4D (FliteViz4D) was created as a unique development platform specifically directed at visualizing air traffic concepts in three-dimensional space, with two additional temporal dimensions for current time and future time. It allows concepts such as 4D Trajectory Based Operations, National Convective Weather Forecast, and 3D Path Arrival Management to be visualized in all their dimensions. This was accomplished by using object-oriented design concepts in the development of FliteViz4D to provide unparalleled flexibility and extensibility. New concepts can be added into the visualization using plugins with no changes to the existing platform. The user can decide which plugins to use, determining exactly how Flite-Viz4D runs and what is visualized. The result is a powerful visualization and analysis system, scalable from a single airport to the entire world, which can be used to analyze any concept that could possibly be visualized abstractly or physically. This paper will provide an overview of the system, providing several examples of how it has been used in recent studies, how it will be used in future studies, and how it can be utilized by other organizations in the aviation industry.},

year={2013},
volume={60},

pages={5747-5762},
abstract={An intelligent complementary sliding-mode control (CSMC) (ICSMC) is proposed in this paper for the fault-tolerant control of a six-phase permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive system with open phases. First, the dynamics of the six-phase PMSM drive system with a lumped uncertainty is described in detail. Then, the fault detection and operating decision method is briefly introduced. Moreover, a CSMC is designed to stabilize the fault-tolerant control of the six-phase PMSM drive system. Furthermore, to improve the required control performance and to maintain the stability of the six-phase PMSM drive system under faulty condition, the ICSMC is developed. In this approach, a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang-type fuzzy neural network with asymmetric membership function (TSKFNN-AMF) estimator with accurate approximation capability is employed to estimate the lumped uncertainty. In addition, the adaptive learning algorithms for the online training of the TSKFNN-AMF are derived using the Lyapunov theorem to guarantee the closed-loop stability. Additionally, to enhance the control performance of the proposed intelligent fault-tolerant control, a 32-b floating-point digital signal processor, TMS320F28335, is adopted for the implementation of the proposed fault-tolerant control system. Finally, some experimental results are illustrated to demonstrate the validity of the proposed fault-tolerant control for the six-phase PMSM drive system via ICSMC.},

abstract={Lower echelon forces face significant barriers in utilizing increasingly available networked resources. Network access at the tactical edge continues to present significant problems of limited bandwidth, disruption, and other constraints. Simultaneously, there is an ever-increasing set of video streams, imagery, intelligence, and live reports available on both tactical edge and upper echelon networks. Systems and applications supporting warfighters must therefore address both the problems of highly constrained networks and the problem of the potentially overwhelming volume of dynamic resources and content. These challenging issues continue to defy easy solution, and so, in this paper, we propose a novel design for server-less information services for stressed and discontinuously available, low bandwidth tactical networks. We design SISTO as a middleware software solution. SISTO is characterized by three major capabilities: a) Semantics-based service and resource discovery with powerful search and browse capabilities, enabling users and service-oriented applications to be notified of opportunistically available information and services, and locate necessary resources, b) Efficient, distributed content distribution mechanisms adapted from peer-to-peer file sharing and torrent protocol for downloading and sharing large data objects such as imagery, video clips, maps, and intelligence datasets over poorly connected, low bandwidth, wireless networks, while opportunistically taking advantage of temporarily available high performing connectivity and c) Server-less proxies and gateways for enterprise applications, enabling tactical edge warfighters to connect to and participate in data sharing, and other capabilities without server infrastructure, while interoperating with users at higher echelons using standard enterprise applications and tools. We plan to implement SISTO in the near future, and report on how it performs relative to the design goals stated in this paper.},

abstract={Terrorist attacks have awakened the awareness of nations around the globe on transportation security/safety. Effective security enhancement measures are needed to prevent terrorist attacks. Prior to the September 11 attack, the Federal Aviation Administration was charged with ensuring the security of both "land-side" and "air-side" operations of Airports. However, after September 11, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was granted responsibility for most of the "land-side" operations. In this paper we seek to answer how much of the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grant distributed by the FAA would be available for Airport security given the establishment of TSA. An investigation of the distribution and trend of AIP grants can provide insights on how AIP funds are used towards transportation security. This study conducts a data mining analysis on the history of AIP grants. Results reveal that the longitudinal distribution of security-related AIP grants differs from that of other AIP grants in terms of their responsiveness to major environmental changes (i.e. terrorist and economic events). In addition, project characteristics such as location and airport types influence the allocation of security-related AIP grants. Implications of the findings are presented.},

abstract={This paper presents a new inversion approach to estimate the depth profile of a fatigue crack from the output signal of an alternating current field measurements (ACFM) probe. We first show that the mapping between the ACFM signals and corresponding crack depth profiles can be expressed by an affine transformation, then we utilize a generalized version of the fuzzy alignment algorithm (FAA) to find this mapping more efficiently. The proposed method is then extended using the Dave's objective function previously proposed for the fuzzy clustering. To evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed inversion technique we reconstruct cracks of arbitrary shapes from both simulated and measured ACFM signals. The results show that the proposed approach is more robust and accurate than existing methods and gives reasonable results even in the absence of sufficient training data.},

The dual linear motors servo system with two parallel permanent magnet linear synchronous motors (PMLSMs) is installed in a gantry position stage. The dynamic model of single-axis motion control system with a lumped uncertainty, which comprises parameter variations, external disturbances and nonlinear friction force, is introduced first. Then, to achieve an accurate trajectory tracking performance with robustness, a cross-coupled ICSMC is developed. In this approach, a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang type fuzzy neural network (TSKFNN) estimator with accurate approximation capability is implemented to estimate the lumped uncertainty. Moreover, since a cross-coupled technology is incorporated into the proposed intelligent control scheme for the gantry position stage, both the position tracking error and synchronous error of the dual linear motors will converge to zero simultaneously. Finally, some experimental results are illustrated to show the validity of the proposed control approach.},

As a result of this, pre-diagnosis varies depending upon the experience of the doctors and patients are subjected to lots of necessary and unnecessary tests. In this study, using the patients face images, a new and efficient software has proposed which automatically diagnoses Acromegaly invariant of age, gender and facial expression. For this purpose, after applying various pre-processing to face images, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Subspace Linear Discriminant Analysis (Subspace LDA) are used to extract features and Euclidean and Manhattan classifiers are used to classify the obtained features. Our results showed that TBA+DAA coupled with Euclidean resulted in highest accuracy of 96%, sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 95% compared to other feature extraction techniques.},

abstract={An active islanding detection method using d-axis disturbance signal injection with intelligent control is proposed in this study. The proposed active islanding detection method is based on injecting a new disturbance signal into the system through the d-axis current that leads to a frequency deviation at the terminal of the resistance inductance and capacitance (RLC) load when the grid is disconnected. The feasibility of the proposed method is evaluated under the UL1741 anti-islanding test configuration. The proposed d-axis disturbance signal-injection method is intended to achieve a reliable detection with quasi-zero non-detection zone, minimum effects on power quality and easy implementation without additional sensing devices or equipments. Moreover, in order to achieve accurate tracking control of active and reactive power and rapid response of the islanding detection of the distributed generator (DG) system, a wavelet fuzzy neural network (WFNN) intelligent controller is proposed to replace the conventional proportional-integral controller for the control of the DG system. Furthermore, the network structure and the online learning algorithm of the WFNN are introduced in detail. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed d-axis disturbance signal-injection method are verified with experimental results.},

abstract={The idea of diminishing the interaction between a PEC volume (however spatially extended) and the source of electromagnetic (EM) illumination is very intriguing since it constitutes the principle of operation of numerous useful devices. Cloaks, absorbers and isolators are only few of the structures whose functionalities are based on controlling the electromagnetic energy exchange of metallic scatterers with current sources. Such a feature is achieved by properly designing a layered structure made from gradually electromagnetically sparser materials which is excited by a line source. The propagation directions of the incident rays are shifted, according to Snell's law, to be tangentially oriented to the rear boundary of the slab cluster. In this way, the EM field does not interact significantly with an arbitrarily large perfectly conducting (PEC) circular cylinder. At the same time, the reflections back to the source are not substantial due to the matched impedance of the layered structure. Accordingly, the propagated field “avoids” the PEC scatterer by cloaking it and not admitting significant energy exchange.},

abstract={The AeroMACS (Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System), which is based on the IEEE 802.16-2009 mobile wireless standard, is envisioned as the wireless network which will cover all areas of airport surfaces for next generation air transportation. It is expected to be implemented in the 5091-5150 MHz frequency band which is also occupied by mobile satellite service uplinks. Thus the AeroMACS must be designed to avoid interference with this incumbent service. Simulations using Visualyse software were performed utilizing a global database of 6207 airports. Variations in base station and subscriber antenna distribution and gain pattern were examined. Based on these simulations, recommendations for global airport base station and subscriber antenna power transmission limitations are provided.},

abstract={The objective of this study was to investigate aircraft taxi times at major U.S. airports. The authors of this investigation previously published a novel, statistical approach to characterizing taxi behavior. In that approach, we attempted to separate deterministic effects, such as departure queuing delays, from variations we asserted analysts could treat as noise. We produced a methodology for creating taxi time parameters for a known combination of airport, carrier, and equipment type. Analysts could use those parameters to simulate taxi times in NAS-wide models. We acknowledged that runway assignment introduced variation in taxi times that would be improper to consider noise. However, we resigned ourselves to ignoring runway assignment because runway data was not easily available. Additionally, we asserted analysts could ascertain a sufficient airport location from the aircraft's carrier and the equipment type. In this investigation, we continued those efforts. We used a similar approach to determine parameters suitable for describing taxi behavior by a particular aircraft, at a particular airport. However, in this investigation, we included some of those factors that we previously ignored. This time, we used the airport runway and the airport gate to help determine appropriate taxi time parameters. We demonstrated the benefits from using the increased information. The additional information used to determine taxi time parameters decreased the variation to the underlying taxi time distribution. However, the improved taxi time parameters yielded mix benefits regarding delay. Runway assignment proved very beneficial to improved delay calculations. However, airport gate only translated into a minimal benefit.},

abstract={Flight information in Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems today is scattered across multiple systems in proprietary formats. Systems must maintain multiple point-to-point connections to access data necessary to fulfill operational objectives leading to high overhead costs. For example, flight messages from the en-route system are accessed through the legacy interfaces in a proprietary format, which requires domain knowledge of the data definition and format in order to parse the content. Developing and maintaining such connections and formats increases costs to both the consumer and the provider. The FAA's Next Generation (NextGen) solution is to abstract the data content and information to standard formats and publish the data to net-centric services in order to provide common services and governance for net-centric data sharing. Through a set of demonstrations, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has shown improved logical and physical simplicity and harmonization of flight information exchange through standardized data and net-centric services. During these demonstrations, it was determined that flight information common support services must be hosted at the enterprise level and made accessible through System Wide Information Management (SWIM) as net-centric services in order for governance rules to be enforced and information be shared authoritatively to the global flight community.},

To reduce the necessary airspace to restrict, tracking technologies such as ADS-B can be employed. The MITRE Corporation has developed the UAT Beacon Radio - Transmit Only (UBR-TX) as a miniaturized ADS-B unit, which was initially intended for unmanned aircraft and General Aviation aircraft. This paper presents the adaptation of the MITRE technology into the UBR-ERAU, a position broadcasting technology capable of operating during sub-orbital space flight. This paper begins with a discussion of some background on the UBR payloads and their flight history. Next, the requirements and goals of the system's upgrades will be discussed followed by the detailed discussion of key system upgrades including GPS selection, software adaptations, and custom hardware. The experimental design and results of evaluating the new prototype is discussed including a detailed discussion of initial high altitude balloon flights. Finally, the paper discusses future plans for the UBR-ERAU payload as its evaluation transitions from balloons to sRLVs.},

abstract={Today, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is challenged with the task of integrating the use of Civil Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS). There are many challenges to understand and overcome before Civil UAS operations are standardized and made routine. These challenges include developing methods to support the integration of operations into the NAS without placing public safety at risk and capacity constraints causing delays. This requires defining acceptable standards for operation and certification of Civil UAS and the establishment of standards and requirements for the operator and pilot. In addition, the creation of an airspace designation for cooperative manned and unmanned flight operations to ensure safe operations simultaneously in the NAS. To achieve these goals, extensive research is required to produce the required safety case evidence. Starting back in 2006, Unmanned Aircraft Systems, including the MQ-1B Predator, RQ-11 Raven and A-160 Hummingbird, began operating in Class D airspace at the Southern California Logistics Airport, Victorville, CA (VCV). VCV tower, operated by Serco Air Traffic Controllers, uses a combination of FAA procedures and special authorizations to provide safe operations. For the past 6 years and on-going, the Serco Air Traffic Controllers at VCV tower provide Visual Flight Rules (VFR) for the safe integration of cooperative manned and unmanned flight operations within the Class D airspace. Looking to the future of integrating Civil UAS into the NAS, VCV provides a live operational environment, having experienced air traffic controllers, pilots and UAS operators to supporting UAS operations. VCV not only provides a live environment, but lessons learned which can support the development of standards for operation, requirements and certification of Civil UAS and the safety case development.},

abstract={Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) represents a cornerstone of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). Improvements in aircraft navigation precision associated with PBN operations pave the way for the development of advanced spacing concepts that evolve currently applicable separation standards and improve operational efficiencies. The Equivalent Lateral Spacing Operation (ELSO) separation standard concept is currently under operational demonstration at The Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL). This paper reports on research carried out to identify other potential implementation sites where PBN-enabled standard concepts could be applied beneficially in the National Airspace System (NAS). It documents the various elements of the study, including the analysis of surveillance data of departure operations, the evaluation approach taken to identify candidate airports, the development of prototype procedure designs, and the methodologies applied to quantify potential operational benefits. The results demonstrate that system-wide integration of PBN-based separation concepts may enable beneficial transformations toward a performance-based NAS. In addition to the potential operational and environmental benefits, the results indicate that PBN-based concepts, if adopted as NextGen standards and applied in lieu of operational waivers, may also reduce FAA reliance on the waiver approval process for enabling beneficial operational changes and reduce the need for waiver status maintenance across the NAS.},

year={2013},
volume={},

pages={1-10},
abstract={Traffic flow in the Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities (TRACON) is a significant factor in determining airport throughput capacity and airline operational efficiency. In recent years the availability of high fidelity terminal area track data has made it possible to increase the granularity of airport and airspace performance analysis. This paper describes a methodology for airport arrival flow analysis using National Offload Program (NOP) track data. The analysis provides insight into track distances flown and track time for alternate terminal arrival flows (i.e. from the final waypoint in the Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR) to the runway threshold via a type of approach). The methodology is applied to 35 days of NOP track data for Chicago TRACON (C90) for arrivals into MDW. Arrivals into MDW landing to the northwest on 31C and to the north-east on 4R exhibit the shortest average track distance (28.42 NM and 29.81 NM.). Arrivals landing to the south-east on 13C exhibit the highest mean track distance of 38.9 NM. Track distance and track time is least for VFR approaches onto all runways. When IMC conditions exist, RNP approaches provide 5–10% savings in track distance and track time over ILS approaches. One unexpected result is that RNP approaches exhibit the same variance in track distance and track time as ILS approaches. The variance in RNP approaches occurs on the downwind and turn-to-base, while the variance on the ILS approach occurs by “tromboning” on the base leg and the turn to final.},

abstract={Procedures such as Missed Approaches and Holding Patterns are designed into Air Traffic Control procedures to provide a safe manner for flights to temporarily exit the airspace or the traffic flow when irregular operations occur. These procedures serve as “pressure release valves” and in this way are symptoms of the occurrence of infrequent phenomena that impact efficiency and safety margins. The occurrence of these procedures is not currently tracked by airlines or Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP) due to the inability to identify these situations using the existing time-stamped event data (i.e. OOOI data) that is the basis for NAS performance analysis today. This paper describes a Big Data analysis of surveillance track data to establish the frequency of occurrence of Aborted Approaches, and an analysis of voluntary pilot/air traffic controller reports to establish factors leading to Aborted Approaches. Aborted Approaches include a Go Around for a Missed Approach as well as a turn off the final approach segment prior to the Missed Approach Point (MAP). Analysis of 21 days of surveillance track data for approaches at ORD identified a 7.4 in 1000 frequency of approaches resulting in an Aborted Approach. Daily Aborted Approaches ranged from 0 per day to 21 per 1000 approaches per day. Eighty percent of the Aborted Approaches involved a turn off the final approach segment prior to the MAP. An analysis of 467 voluntary pilot/air traffic controller reports from all U.S. airports identified factors leading to aborted approaches: (1) 48% airplane issues (e.g. onboard failure, unstable approach), (2) 27% traffic separation issues, (3) 16% weather (e.g. ceiling, visibility, crosswind), (4) 5% runway issues, and (5) 4% flightcrew-ATC interaction issues. These results suggest mitigation strategies to reduce the high variance in daily occurrences through procedure modification, training and equipment design.},

abstract={Required Navigation Performance (RNP) provides a way to produce precise lateral and vertical flight paths. To date, RNP has been leveraged primarily in the approach phase of flight to provide more efficient descent paths and improved access to terrain, obstacle, or airspace challenged airports. However, RNP may also be used in departure, en-route, and arrival phases of flight. The concept of an end-to-end system of RNP procedures utilizes the high performance navigation capability of today's modern aircraft to improve the repeatability and predictability of the entire route of flight. This may allow for a reduction in system block times and proportional savings based on aircraft direct operating costs per hour. Additionally, these routes could improve the accuracy of today's terminal metering tools and provide the foundation for future enhancements. This paper describes the concept and benefits of a highly repeatable route structure in the context of a suite of RNP end-to-end procedures between Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) and Boston Logan International Airport (BOS).},

abstract={In the concept development and validation process, fast-time simulation and modeling exercises are performed to examine system performance, obtain initial assessments of potential benefits, and to identify potential problem areas where real-time simulation studies are necessary for further exploration [1]. Despite the immense impact weather has on the National Airspace System (NAS), most simulation and analysis tools are unable to represent weather activity. This creates a large gap in the capabilities of future concept analysis such that potential benefits of some operational improvements cannot be quantified. The FAA's Concept Analysis Branch (ANG-C41) developed a tool which uses high fidelity weather data to create weather polygons. These weather polygons provide a much more concise model to store and process in simulation and analysis tools. In a fast-time simulation environment, the weather polygons can be modeled as restricted airspace that moves across the NAS. This enables researchers to measure the impact of operational improvements on weather-related flight delays. The weather polygons can also be used in analytical tools such as ANG-C41's FliteViz4D. Incorporating the weather polygons into this tool allows the user to animate both air traffic and weather in one three-dimensional view. This is very useful when examining the impact of weather on air traffic. In this paper, the Concept Analysis Branch describes the process of creating and using weather polygons for simulation and analysis activities. An example study is discussed where weather polygons are used to determine the impact of weather on flight efficiency in today's NAS. Finally, the weather polygons are tested in a fast-time simulation environment.},

abstract={This paper presents an approach to expand on the Annual Service Volume (ASV) method for estimating air traffic delays. The ASV approach is a direct and intuitive method to estimate air traffic delays at an airport based on airline scheduled demand levels at that particular airport. The Seasonal Delay Curve (SDC) approach attempts to build on the ASV delay estimates by accounting for seasonal capacity variations. The result is an equally intuitive method that sheds light on the impact that seasons can have on delays at specific airports. This improvement helps explain why a particular scheduled level of demand can produce different amounts of delay in January than in July. This paper demonstrates how delay estimates can differ by season at airports like SFO and ORD that have noticeable seasonality in their arrival and departure rates.},

title={Modeling the impact of fuel price on the utilization of piston engine aircraft},
year={2013},
volume={},

pages={1-12},
abstract={In the United States, piston engine aircraft play an important role in the General Aviation. However, the utilization of piston engine aircraft - measured by the average number of hours of use every year - has been declining during the past decade. It is believed that the decline is partially due to the high fuel price. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the impact of fuel price on the utilization of piston engine aircraft. Our contribution is twofold: 1) we used an econometric model to investigate the impact of fuel price on the utilization rate of piston engine aircraft; 2) we adopted a logistic model to identify the relationship between fuel price and the status of a piston engine aircraft (i.e., the possibility of staying active in the fleet). To provide more insight, model calibrations and analyses are done for single-engine piston engine aircraft, multi-engine piston aircraft, and piston aircraft (i.e., the combination of the two groups), respectively. We found that the relative fuel price, i.e., fuel price to personal income ratio, has a significant impact on the utilization of piston engine aircraft. The elasticity of utilization rate with respect to the relative fuel price is -0.67 for single-engine piston aircraft, -0.23 for multi-engine piston aircraft, and -0.6 for all piston engine aircraft combined. A one-unit increase in the relative fuel price could decrease the odds of staying active by 1.91% for single-engine piston aircraft, 1.43% for multi-engine piston aircraft, and 1.78% for all piston engine aircraft. Using the two models, we estimate the utilization of piston engine aircraft under three future fuel price scenarios: a reference fuel price scenario, a high fuel price scenario, and a low fuel price scenario. We compared our projections with those performed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). For single-engine piston aircraft and piston engine aircraft, the FAA's projections are close to our projections under reference fuel price scenario. For multi-engine piston aircraft, the FAA's projections are close to our projections under high fuel price scenario.},

abstract={Since the advent of aerial navigation in the United States and through the formation of the FAA in 1958 until the present day, an under-lying principle of airspace management has always been for controllers to issue clearances and optimize traffic flow on a “first come — first served” basis. Regardless of the equipment or the size of the aircraft, air traffic services were afforded in the order a request was received. As the efficiency of the national airspace system (NAS) is stretched to unprecedented levels, airspace capacity is reaching its limits. Equipment that mitigates this capacity shortfall is available — at a cost. Not all aircraft will be able to equip with this high-end automation, which begs the questions: In these instances is ‘first-come, first served’ the most just policy? Is it possible to replace ‘first-come, first served’ with ‘best capable, best served’ without materially affecting how air traffic control services are provided? Is it possible to provide multiple levels of service to aircraft based upon the equipment aboard in an efficient and safe manner? Is it fair to provide additional benefits to those who can afford to equip? This paper will explore each of these questions in turn. Examinations will include the airborne components and ground components and how the evolution from “first-come, first-served” to “best-capable, best-served” can be made to be beneficial to all.},

title={Comparison of High Reliability Organizations (HROS)},

volume={},

pages={1-10},
abstract={High Reliability Organizations (HROs) are defined as enterprises that perform missions involving processes that require extraordinary measures to maintain low risk in the presence of disruptions that could result in catastrophic events (e.g. radiation or well leaks leading to long-term environmental damage) or fatalities (e.g. epidemics, air traffic control). These types of enterprises occur in multiple domains ranging from health care, processing of raw materials, energy and water distribution, and vehicle systems management and control. The existing literature describes the diverse characteristics of HROs and the organizational design to manage these characteristics. This paper describes a comparison of the properties of the enterprises (“what”) and the organizational structures (“how”) used to achieve the desired high reliability for: (1) Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Air Traffic Control System, (2) Pacific Electric and Gas Company's Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant (DCNPP), and (3) Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). A detailed review of HRO literature, case studies and organizational reports, performance plans and technical plans identify the following properties of the HRO design: (1) all three domains require the employment of skilled personnel that are certified by a regulatory (federal or state) authority and require specialized training; (2) certification of operations is overseen by regulatory authorities (federal and state); and (3) metrics are focused on risks. Examples of the metrics for each enterprise are as follows: runway incursions, system risk event rates, number of near midair collisions for air traffic control; length and quality of life, pain levels, infections for children's health care; and nuclear power plants use reactor accidents, acute radiation exposures resulting in fatalities, release of radioactive materials that result in significant radiation exposure for nuclear power plants. These enterprises focus on making consistently good decisions that result in higher quality, safer and more reliable operations.},

pages={1-12},
abstract={Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) need quantitative models of risk to set priorities for research, development, and implementation of Operational Improvements (OIs). Although collision risk is a concern both in flight and on the airport surface, there is a lack of models for collision risk associated with airport surface movement. This paper describes progress at formulating, implementing, and validating a quantitative model for collision likelihood on the airport surface, particularly taxiways, under the sponsorship of the FAA's Office of Aviation Safety (AVS). The model uses detailed surveillance-based analysis of surface movement to measure the number and characteristics of discrete interactions during taxi that represent pre-conditions for collision. The model's estimates of separation consider the relative position of aircraft extremities (nose, wingtips, and tail.) Although the initial model is restricted to movement area collisions between aircraft, the methods may be extended to ramp movement and to aircraft-vehicle interactions. The model addresses collision likelihood and lays the groundwork for integration with a severity model addressing the consequences of collision. Preliminary results obtained from applying the analytical model to surveillance obtained from four ASDE-X airports, and the efforts to calibrate these results against historical accident and incident data, are provided and discussed. These results show that it is feasible to statistically characterize all interactions between aircraft on the airport surface in order to model collision risk. The expected benefits of these methods are improved identification of conditions associated with increased collision likelihood, better prediction of the effect of operational changes on this likelihood, and quantitative inputs to the benefits analysis for operational improvements.},

title={Potential wake turbulence encounters analysis in current and NextGen flight operations},
year={2013},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-7},
abstract={With an increasing population of super heavy aircraft operating in the National Airspace System and with the introduction of NextGen technologies, the wake vortex problem has become more important for airport capacity and the en-route air traffic operations. The vortices generated by heavy and super heavy aircraft can generate potential hazards to other aircraft on nearby flight paths. Moreover, the design of new airport procedures needs to consider the interactions between aircraft in closer paths. New methods and models are required to examine these effects before new operations are conducted in the National Airspace System (NAS). Reducing wake vortex separations to safe levels between successive aircraft is essential for NextGen operations. One approach taken recently by ICAO and the FAA is to introduce a re-categorization (RECAT) of wake vortex separations to six groups from the existing five groups employed by the FAA in the United States. Reduced aircraft separations can increase capacity in the (NAS) with corresponding savings in delay times at busy airports. Future Nextgen operations are likely to introduce smaller aircraft separations in the enroute and in the terminal area. Such operations would require better methods to identify potential wake hazards from reduced separation operations. This paper describes a simulation-based approach to identify potential wake encounters in the future NAS. The goal of the paper is to describe the Wake Encounter Model (WEM), a model that employs a detailed NASA-developed wake model to generate wake zones for different aircraft categories under different flight conditions that can be used with aircraft flight path data to identify potential wake encounters. The main contribution of this model is to gain an understanding of potential wake encounters under future NAS operations.},

abstract={Departure Clearance - Evolution from Voice to Digital Communication on the Airport Surface Voice communication is a pillar of air traffic management throughout all phases of flight - but nowhere is it as important as during surface operations. Finding space on the frequency to communicate can often times be a challenge, especially when operations become irregular during weather events or peak push-times. Ground frequencies can become saturated with controllers providing taxi and clearance instructions to pilots and vehicles. To alleviate saturation, ANSPs have turned to more efficient ways to communicate route and clearance information to aircraft. Many airports around the world are using data link as a means to provide route and clearance instructions to the cockpit without using voice communications. The U.S. FAA's Tower Data Link System (TDLS) has been used for more than a decade to provide route clearance information to pilots via Pre-Departure Clearance (PDC) messages. TDLS generates the PDC with data obtained from the HOST or ERAM flight data processor and sends it to a dispatcher working in the airline operations center for airlines using the PDC service. The dispatcher then forwards the PDC directly to the cockpit of equipped aircraft and the pilot via ACARS. PDCs are issued 20 to 30 minutes prior to departure and once issued, revisions cannot be generated. If a revision is necessary, the pilot and controller revert to voice communication to issue and accept the clearance instructions.},

The FAA is currently leasing its building on rent cost per square foot and not Life Cycle Costs (LCCs). This is comparable to buying a car solely based on the sticker price to cargo capacity ratio. There are many more costs to consider over the length of ownership of a car, such as fuel economy, passenger capacity, and maintenance costs. One way for the FAA to meet the target in the existing budget is to incorporate LCC practices in the lease acquisition process. This way buildings are evaluated based on operational costs incurred over the entire lease term to yield net savings. To evaluate potential savings, an LCC Lease Analysis (LCCLA) decision support tool has been developed to assess leasing options factoring energy and water cost fluctuations for specific buildings in the FAA database. The tool includes three leasing strategies: (1) renewing the existing lease-this option will not help the FAA achieve the E.O.13514; (2) renovating the buildings to meet HPSB standards-the FAA may incur a higher rent, but will be able to satisfy E.0.13514; and (3) relocating the employees to a building that already satisfies E.O.13514. To generate accurate LCCLA results, surrogate data was used to analyze relationships between number of employees per building, cost per square foot, climate zones, and energy costs with respect to lease term, inflation, and energy costs projections. The analysis has identified fifteen buildings showing either a positive savings, net zero financial impact, or lowest costs. All but one of these buildings is less than 25000 square feet. This is a result of the lower cost of renovating smaller buildings. The analysis also reveals that full service leases do not allow the FAA to reap the benefits of the green technology. Since the responsibility of paying utilities falls to the lessor, the lessor is in a position to charge a premium rent to cover the stochastic energy costs. If those costs are actually less than what was negotiated, the lessor can pocket the difference. Partial service leases give finer control over money for utility bills. This method of leasing also has the capability of giving immediate feedback as to the performance of the efficiency of the building.},

abstract={The rise in aviation-related emissions accompanying the increase in demand for air travel is raising concerns about aviation's impact on the climate. There is a growing public interest in climate change issues as a body of activists drives corporations to heed environmental concerns. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) for the U.S., controls the transit time for flights in its airspace, which is a major factor that determines the fuel burn and emissions produced. However, the FAA has no current system to estimate emissions from en-route operations, measure performance and set targets for improvement. The purpose of this paper is to provide the U.S. ANSP, the FAA, with a decision support tool to estimate the amount of CO2 emissions produced from en-route flights and analyze alternative routes to increase the ANSP's performance in regard to CO2 taking into consideration the workload of the air traffic controllers. The focus of the analysis is to reduce the flight transit time. The alternatives are Near Wind Optimal Routes (NWORs) for flights in one or more of the four distance categories of the baseline (Flights flying: less than 500, from 500 to 999, from 1000 to 1500 and greater than 1500 nautical miles). The tool, Aircraft Emissions Decision Support Tool (AEDST), is a deterministic model developed to calculate the fuel burn and emissions for any aircraft given the 4-D trajectory data (longitude, latitude, altitude, velocity, time) and the fuel burn rate per unit time at different phases of the flight. The Future Air Traffic Management Concepts Evaluation Tool (FACET) was used to calculate the number of conflicts between flights, which represent the air traffic controllers' workload. The results show the improvement in the ANSP's performance by implementing NWORs for flight distances less than 1500 nautical miles by 19%, which provide the airlines with approximately $16M in fuel savings. Implementing those routes also reduces the workload of air traffic controllers by 2.5%.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is in the process of integrating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) into the National Airspace System (NAS) through the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). A critical component of integrating UAVs into the NAS is the timely identification and mitigation of cyber attacks that could overtake control of a UAV, without the UAV operator's knowledge of a security breach. In an effort to address this risk, this paper aims to achieve two objectives: (i) identify risks of cyber attacks on a UAV and (ii) create a methodology through which UAV operators are informed of such a security breach. The results of this study are intended to support the MITRE Corporation's efforts to identify and control risks associated with UAV integration into the NAS. To achieve the first objective the Capstone team utilized established risk assessment methodologies to identify risk scenarios and filter those scenarios into a manageable list. To achieve the second objective the team developed a methodology that measures the UAV velocity through two on-board systems and any significant difference in the two measures indicates a potential security breach. The team designed and performed an experiment using car movement to simulate UAV flight and performed statistical analysis on the results of the experiment. This contributed to a framework for determining a detection threshold for an alarm system to indicate a UAV may have been hijacked. The threshold accounts for a minimum difference between the two calculations of the velocity data and the duration of time in which this difference occurs, which can be calibrated to minimize Type I (false positive) and Type II (false negative) errors. The recommendation to the MITRE Corporation will contribute to the ongoing efforts to securely integrate UAVs into the NAS.},

abstract={ITT Exelis has built and operates the Surveillance Broadcast Services (SBS) system to provide the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) with Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) target data in the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS). The system requirements for significant coverage at low altitudes demands a dense laydown of radio stations such that at moderate and high altitudes there is an abundance of overlapping coverage from multiple radio stations. While such redundancy is generally a good attribute, the future expected growth in ADS-B equipage will place a large burden on the SBS network and servers because of that redundancy. In order to proactively mitigate that traffic growth, the SBS is designed with a number of traffic management features to control the amount of redundant reports from multiple radio stations. This paper summarizes a study that projects the impact of the growth in ADS-B equipped traffic on the SBS system, and evaluates the effectiveness and adequacy of existing and new candidate network traffic management features under consideration in the SBS.},

This paper presents an instrumented RF system to demonstrate these properties. In particular, a landing system will be studied in this paper. By definition, the Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) provides local GPS error corrections to aircraft from a ground-based station. The Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) is one implementation of GBAS that is being developed to meet the needs of very low-visibility instrument approaches. There are concerns of the possibility that a LAAS ground station might inadvertently transmit a signal in space (SIS) that includes Hazardous Misleading Information (HMI). The current method of detecting HMI relies heavily on statistical inference to determine the integrity of the transmitted error corrections. This paper presents a method of closing the loop of the LAAS transmission to deterministically reduce the probability of transmitting HMI.},

abstract={This paper presents a new multistructure fluxgate magnetic sensor composed of Metglas®Fe-based amorphous HB1 material. The core thickness of the fabricated structure is 0.0254 mm × 30 pieces, and its width is 5 mm. The magnetic loss of the fluxgate core is simulated through finite element analysis. The fluxgate sensor is experimentally analyzed over a frequency range 0.5-3 kHz. The sensor performance exploits the advantages of the multistructure core-shaped magnetic material as well as the second-harmonic operation mechanism. Excellent flux responses are detected for the triangular core sensor, which has different operating frequencies for magnetostriction variation, harmonic response, total harmonic distortion, noise level, sensor vibration, and sensitivity. The influence of magnetostriction, magnetic loss, and permeability in multiangled cores for different frequencies is analyzed. Our multistructure fluxgate sensor is suitable for various applications including power transformer and inverter for interior magnetic core fault detection, owing to its thin-film configuration, high sensitivity, high resolution, and low magnetic loss.},

abstract={The fast advance in networked and ubiquitous computing leads to remarkable innovation also in data storage technologies. The classical local/remote storage dichotomy has been enriched due the introduction of new hardware and networking technologies such as plenty of different kinds of solid-state storage devices (e.g., USB pen drives) as well as several advanced distributed serverless storage facilities such as peer-to-peer file sharing networks and cloud-based storage services (SaaS). Such sample technologies can be considered as the endpoints of a wide range of storage facilities that, although characterized by important technological differences, share several crucial security issues. Indeed, such kind of storage, (here referred to as “nomadic”) could undermine data security and privacy within large organizations even if they adopt strong security policies. This paper faces the problem of enforcing security policies within a security domain whose nodes are not permanently connected each other, mainly concerning of the protection of data stored on nomadic data stores. The authors survey some solutions available in literature that could potentially fit this scenario with the aim of defining a framework to secure such storage facilities in terms of file system engineering. To this end, two practical scenarios leveraging on nomadic storage facilities are discussed: (1)the deployment of USB storage devices to asynchronously share sensitive data, and (2) facing assurance requirements in managing large projects conducted by cooperating independent communities of software developers (such as the so called Open Source Community) by means of Distributed Revision Control Systems.},

abstract={Sense and Avoid Systems (SAASs) are one of the last technical challenges for the safe integration of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) into the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS). While military applications still dominate UAS use, civilian UAS usage is expected to grow dramatically over the next several years. However with this growth, there are significant air safety concerns. SAASs have been proposed as potential solutions for air traffic collisions and obstacle avoidance, but the technical implementations have been largely unsatisfactory. The development of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) surveillance tracking technology known as Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) has been proposed as one of the potential solutions. This technology, mandated to be in all aircraft by 2020, is designed to improve situational awareness for pilots and improve air traffic management but may also be utilized by UASs. However there remains implementation issues and regulatory issues, especially for small UASs (SUASs) that are expected to be used significantly by civilian operators. This paper examines the use of ADS-B in future SAASs and their implementations in SUAS for domestic use.},

abstract={Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) have the ability operate in chaotic and heterogeneous environments near the ground that are inaccessible to manned aircraft. This is significant because navigable airspace, which is in the public domain and preempted by federal laws, is defined by the minimum safe altitudes of flight. Since many sUAS arguably have no minimum safe altitude, they could potentially expand navigable airspace to the ground, posing a serious challenge to property rights, privacy expectations, and local control. This paper discusses the issue in historical context, raises new questions about the current direction for sUAS regulation, and suggests an alternative framework that would have benefits for governmental efficiency, the civilian UAS industry, and the public at large.},

abstract={Continuous life annuities have an important role in life insurers, and it is necessary to utilize a fractional age assumption when we calculate the actuarial present values of these life annuities. Obviously, the rationality of the assumption decides the calculation accuracy. Comparing with other used assumptions, the death information of the life table can be utilized more adequately under this assumption. At the same time, we can obtain the continuous mortality force in all life time if this assumption is used, and this assumption also has other good geometric properties. Hence, Hossion Assumption can improve the estimated accuracy of fractional age mortality rates. Based on Hossian Assumption, the actuarial present values (abbreviated to APVs) of three continuous life annuities are discussed. We obtain the calculation expressions of these APVs based on Hossian Assumption. In addition, using the experience life table of the Chinese Pension (2000-2003) (male), the numerical calculations are carried out respectively. And we compare the results with ones under UDD assumption.},

year={2013},
volume={},
number={},
pages={29-40},
abstract={In this paper, we introduce novel compiler optimization techniques to reduce the number of operations performed in critical sections that occur in explicitly-parallel programs. Specifically, we focus on three code transformations: 1) Partial Strength Reduction (PSR) of critical sections to replace critical sections by non-critical sections on certain control flow paths; 2) Critical Load Elimination (CLE) to replace memory accesses within a critical section by accesses to scalar temporaries that contain values loaded outside the critical section; and 3) Non-critical Code Motion (NCM) to hoist thread-local computations out of critical sections. The effectiveness of the first two transformations is further increased by interprocedural analysis. The effectiveness of our techniques has been demonstrated for critical section constructs from three different explicitly-parallel programming models - the isolated construct in Habanero Java (HJ), the synchronized construct in standard Java, and transactions in the Java-based Deuce software transactional memory system. We used two SMP platforms (a 16-core Intel Xeon SMP and a 32-Core IBM Power7 SMP) to evaluate our optimizations on 17 explicitly-parallel benchmark programs that span all three models. Our results show that the optimizations introduced in this paper can deliver measurable performance improvements that increase in magnitude when the program is run with a larger number of processor cores.

abstract={An intelligent controlled three-phase squirrel-cage induction generator (SCIG) system for grid-connected power application using wavelet fuzzy neural network (WFNN) is proposed in this study. First, the indirect field-oriented mechanism is implemented for the control of the SCIG system. Then, an AC/DC power converter and a DC/AC power inverter are developed to convert the electric power generated by a three-phase SCIG from variable-voltage and variable-frequency to constant-voltage and constant-frequency. Moreover, the intelligent WFNN controller is proposed for both the AC/DC power converter and DC/AC power inverter to improve the transient and steady-state responses of the SCIG system at different operating conditions. Three online trained WFNNs using backpropagation learning algorithm are implemented as the tracking controllers for the DC-link voltage of the AC/DC power converter and the active power and reactive power outputs of the DC/AC power inverter. Furthermore, the network structure and the online learning algorithm of the WFNN are introduced in detail. Finally, some experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SCIG system.},

abstract={The roles of reactive power control in a distribution system become essential due to the high penetration of distributed generations (DG) these days. Proper reactive power control can reduce real power losses and regulate the voltage profile in a power system. However, intermittent characteristics of DGs (e.g., renewable energies from wind and solar power) impose uncertainty on power generation in the power system. Therefore, this paper presents a novel fast probabilistic power-flow (FPPF) method based on the Gram-Charlier series expansion to deal with such uncertainty. The FPPF method only deals with stochastic variations of random variables with respect to the expected values, thus reducing the number of iterations. Moreover, the chaotic particle swarm optimization is used to adjust generator voltages, transformer taps, and static compensators to minimize the real power losses while the stochastic voltages satisfy the operational limits. Applicability of the proposed method is verified through simulation using an autonomous 25-bus (Penghu) system and the IEEE 118-bus system. Comparative studies considering traditional probabilistic power-flow methods are performed as well.},

abstract={In 2008 EUROCONTROL published Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Security Guidance to Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), to assist them in complying with regulatory security requirements. The validation of that guidance included surveys which were conducted to contrast current practice in European ANSPs with a baseline control set based on ISO/IEC 27001:2005. The surveys are confidential and unpublished, however, by identifying the controls that are missing in all the survey responses it is possible to identify potential 'blind spots' in Air Traffic Management (ATM) security while maintaining the anonymity of the respondents. Key issues identified in this way include security management and senior management engagement, system accreditation, the validation and authentication of data used by ATM systems, incident management, and business continuity preparedness. Since little can be said about the original surveys these results are necessarily indicative, so the paper contrasts these findings with contemporaneous audit reports on security in US ATM systems. The two sources prove to be in close agreement, suggesting that the issues identified are systematic difficulties in introducing security into Air Traffic Management culture.},

abstract={A computed force control system using functional link radial basis function network with asymmetric membership function (FLRBFN-AMF) for three-dimension motion control of a piezo-flexural nanopositioning stage (PFNS) is proposed in this study. First, the dynamics of the PFNS mechanism with the introduction of a lumped uncertainty including the equivalent hysteresis friction force are derived. Then, a computed force control system with an auxiliary control is proposed for the tracking of the reference contours with improved steady-state response. Since the dynamic characteristics of the PFNS are non-linear and time varying, a computed force control system using FLRBFN-AMF is designed to improve the control performance for the tracking of various reference trajectories, where the FLRBFN-AMF is employed to estimate a non-linear function including the lumped uncertainty of the PFNS. Moreover, by using the asymmetric membership function, the learning capability of the networks can be upgraded and the number of fuzzy rules can be optimised for the functional link radial basis function network. Furthermore, the adaptive learning algorithms for the training of the parameters of the FLRBFN-AMF online are derived using the Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, some experimental results for the tracking of various reference contours of the PFNS are given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed control system.},

pages={1522-1524},
abstract={As restrictions on operating small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) in the United States national airspace system (NAS) have compounded university researchers in this discipline have had to react by developing increasingly more novel ways to collect remote sensing data. Current restrictions by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) require universities to apply for a Certificate of Authorization (COA) to operate any remote control device for the purposes of research. Previously, many universities operated under Advisory Circular (AC) 91-57 (for model aircraft operators). University research does not fall under this circular and therefore, alternative methods of gathering aerial images in support of the universities remote sensing projects needed to be explored. The freshman engineering design course at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore is a multidisciplinary and collaborative effort between the Engineering Program and Aviation Sciences Program faculty. Introductory engineering design process theory is taught by engineering faculty while students engage in an experiential exercise in problem solving with the Aviation faculty serving the role of a client with a specific problem that needs to be remedied. This paper outlines the freshmen engineering design process from the introduction of the initial problem statement, mid-term review and final product delivery of a remote release system for a non-powered glider sensor system. The aviation faculty serving as the client is involved with the class from initial team selection to evaluation of the final product and student's presentation abilities. Students were asked to design a remote release system that would support the deployment of the client's glider platform from an existing kite lifting device. The freshman design class was divided into two groups and asked to design systems that would meet the clients design criteria. The authors present an in depth comparison of design approaches, execution and lessons learned. Group leadership dynamics are considered.},

abstract={Due to the increasing reliance on electronic data exchange in the transportation industry, there is a real need for a standard representation to ensure data consistency and correctness. The Aeronautical Information Exchange Model (AIXM) is an international XML-based emerging standard for aviation data, endorsed by the Open Geospatial Consortium, which has been adopted by Air Navigation organisations around the world including Euro control, FAA, and Air services Australia. The AIXM schema provides a structural framework for data representation. However, in order to support global and flexible data interoperability, local extensions and optional elements must be included. This necessary flexibility makes it difficult to ensure completeness and quality. In this paper, we propose an approach for ensuring data consistency and completeness during a global standard adoption process in which an existing aviation legacy database system is translated into AIXM. We have used our approach to design an automated testing application which can be used to compare values of an existing data representation with any XML-based standard, using simple mapping rules defined in a spreadsheet or XML file. We have evaluated the effectiveness and performance of this tool on a very large, operational database, validating the quality of data in both the relational database (source) and AIXM XML instances (destination).},

abstract={Aerospace development processes are regulated by hardware, software or system-level standards. These standards describe the phases of the life-cycle, and the techniques that guarantee or assess the safety of systems and components. Standards are mostly written independently one from the others, and despite major similarities, they also include several distinctions which force companies to apply different expertise, training, personnel and procedures for each of them. This increases the difficulty in adopting new or different standards, ultimately resulting in increased costs. This paper investigates the differences between relevant aerospace standards, namely, the standards investigated include ARP4754A/4761, DO-178B/C, DO-254, ED-153, FAA HBK006A, Galileo Software Standard (GSWS) and the ECSS series, through comparison of lifecycle and major requirements. Evidence is given of main commonalities between the standards, but also of several, non-negligible specificities, what make it more challenging to define a unique development process, and set of activities and competences required to achieve the standards compliance.},

abstract={In 2012, NASA and FAA jointly conducted a human-in-the-loop air traffic simulation to evaluate the utility of the Terminal Area Precision Scheduling and Spacing (TAPSS) system for supporting Performance-Based Navigation arrival operations during periods of congestion at a mid-sized airport. The TAPSS system is a trajectory-based strategic planning and tactical control tool that was developed to efficiently manage arrivals. For this study, the TAPSS system was enhanced to handle Required Navigation Performance arrivals. A baseline case, where none of the TAPSS system's advisories were provided, was run along with two different configurations of the TAPSS system with differing sets of controller advisory tools. The engineering data indicate that the TAPSS system has a potential to enable efficient Performance-Based Navigation arrival operations. The participating controllers found the TAPSS system's advisories useful. When controllers were given the full set of TAPSS advisory tools, 90% of Required Navigation Performance arrivals stayed on-path as compared to 87% in the baseline case, the average extra track distance of Area Navigation arrivals decreased by 36%, and the average number of controller voice communications decreased by 13%.},

abstract={NASA has developed the Terminal Sequencing and Spacing (TSS) system, a suite of advanced arrival management technologies combining time-based scheduling and controller precision spacing tools. TSS is a ground-based controller automation tool that facilitates sequencing and merging arrivals that have both current standard ATC routes and terminal Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) routes, especially during highly congested demand periods. In collaboration with the FAA and MITRE's Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD), TSS system performance was evaluated in human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations with currently active controllers as participants. Traffic scenarios had mixed Area Navigation (RNAV) and Required Navigation Performance (RNP) equipage, where the more advanced RNP-equipped aircraft had preferential treatment with a shorter approach option. Simulation results indicate the TSS system achieved benefits by enabling PBN, while maintaining high throughput rates-10% above baseline demand levels. Flight path predictability improved, where path deviation was reduced by 2 NM on average and variance in the downwind leg length was 75% less. Arrivals flew more fuel-efficient descents for longer, spending an average of 39 seconds less in step-down level altitude segments. Self-reported controller workload was reduced, with statistically significant differences at the p<;0.01 level. The RNP-equipped arrivals were also able to more frequently capitalize on the benefits of being “Best-Equipped, Best-Served” (BEBS), where less vectoring was needed and nearly all RNP approaches were conducted without interruption.},

title={Key performance issues in Surface Collaborative Decision Making},

volume={},

pages={1B1-1-1B1-15},
abstract={Surface Collaborative Decision-Making (SCDM) is a process for data exchange to improve the efficient movement of arrivals and departures on and near the airport surface. The Surface CDM Concept of Operations (the ConOps) describes a vision for data exchange as well as a process for metering the flow of departures entering the movement area in order to reduce the need for physical departure queues [1]. This departure metering capability is known as Departure Reservoir Management (DRM). Under the DRM concept, flight operators provide and maintain an updated Earliest Off-Block Time (EOBT) for each flight indicating when the operator expects the flight to be ready to push back from the gate. The DRM assigns each flight a Target Movement Area entry Time (TMAT) when departure metering is in effect. The DRM selects the timing of the TMAT's to maintain a queue at the end of each departure runway of the Target Queue Length (measured in aircraft) whenever there is sufficient demand. If the demand and capacity of each runway are as forecast, and taxi-out and related processes occur as predicted, a queue of the Target Queue Length (measured in aircraft) will be maintained. The DRM capability is expected to be implemented at several airports in 2015 as part of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). When the information provided to DRM contains inaccuracies, maintenance of the target queue length may be compromised. In response to updates in poor information, DRM may re-adjust TMAT's in an attempt to maintain the desired queue. Updates to TMAT's present challenges to the flight operators who attempt to orchestrate aircraft loading, gate operations, passenger communications, crew times, and a variety of other factors in order to hit their assigned TMAT's. A variety of controls is envisioned in the ConOps to allow the Departure Reservoir Coordinator (DRC) to encourage TMAT stability while maintaining the desired queue lengths. In this paper we discuss the Surface CDM Simulation, a simulation model of airport performance that can be achieved under DRM as described in the Surface CDM Concept of Operations, as well as results and insights gained from the model. We show that the concept can work very well when provided with accurate, timely information from operators, but that inaccurate information can lead to undesirable outcomes. We also find that the different TMAT stability controls provided in the ConOps are of varying effectiveness. We expect these results to be useful to future operators of Surface CDM DRM capabilities, to the designers of tools enabling Surface CDM, and to developers focused on future refinements of the Surface CDM Concept of Operations.},

As an initial effort, the FAA has selected the terminal arrival/departure domain to validate this approach. As opposed to focusing on the “latest technology”, the identification of deficiencies is guiding the FAA's system development strategies by giving decision-makers greater insight into the most important capabilities needed in future operations. This will help to achieve the vision set forth by the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). For this initial effort, MITRE/CAASD worked with the FAA to assemble a team of representatives currently working within terminal arrival/departure field facilities across the NAS to elicit their expertise and input. Operational representatives were solicited with experience in a wide range of operational environments, which is key to identifying a comprehensive set of deficiencies. For contextsetting purposes, situations that a TRACON controller would encounter and an associated line of questioning to help guide the discussions was prepared. Several outreach sessions were then conducted, and the results were analyzed and synthesized into structured cause and effect assessments. Selected results are provided in this paper. This paper documents the process that was used to ensure that the originating perspective from theoperational representatives was retained; that sound systems engineering techniques were applied; and that the focus remained on identifying and prioritizing deficiencies (i.e., examining solutions will come in later steps). The findings of this work will be used to aid investment decision-making for the TRACON environment, and the methods described here may be refined for outreach and analysis in identifying operational deficiencies in other operational domains such as en route, traffic flow management and surface.},

abstract={Air Traffic Management (ATM) related inefficiencies are causing important unnecessary expenses to airlines around the world. The long-term ATM paradigm shift led by SESAR and NextGen will require years and important investments before it brings its long-awaited benefits. New arrival and departure management tools, new systems to manage and share air-traffic-related information or innovations in the traffic flow management systems are some of the elements of the new system. While these future tools and concepts are under development, important efficiency improvements can be addressed in the short term with today's ATM paradigm and systems simply by introducing small changes in current practices or airspace designs. A good example of this is the FAA Tie-point Optimized Profile Descent (OPD) concept that leverages current standard air traffic controller practices to achieve significant fuel savings during the arrival phase. While not bringing the full benefits expected by the long-term ATM solutions, this concept has been successfully implemented in several US airports without the need of additional automation in the air or on the ground, and thus requiring almost no investment from Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs). To promote the use of this concept, this paper presents a method to design and optimize a Tie-point OPD solution for a generic airport. This optimization method is based on an iterative design process which is supported by fast-time air traffic simulations to maximize the statistical probability of completing an uninterrupted OPD in a given environment. Boeing's fast-time air traffic simulation tool ELASTic (Enterprise Library for Analysis and Simulation of Trajectories and Traffic) was used to conduct the fast-time simulation experiments in this paper. The tool was set up to have a good representation of the tie-point-based ATC function, and is equipped with validated aircraft performance and FMS models, as well as four-dimensional wind and temperature fields and their uncertainties.},

abstract={This paper presents an overview of a Traffic Aware Strategic Aircrew Requests (TASAR) Electronic Flight Bag application intended to inform the pilot of trajectory improvement opportunities while en route that result in operational benefits. The results of safety analyses and a detailed review of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulatory documents that establish certification and operational approval requirements are presented for TASAR. The safety analyses indicate that TASAR has a likely Failure Effects Classification of “No Effect,” and at most, is no worse than “Minor Effect.” Based on this safety assessment and the detailed review of FAA regulatory documents that determine certification and operational approval requirements, this study concludes that TASAR can be implemented in the flight deck as a Type B software application hosted on a Class 2 Portable Electronic Device (PED) Electronic Flight Bag (EFB). This implementation approach would provide a relatively low-cost path to certification and operational approval for both retrofit and forward fit implementation, while at the same time facilitating the business case for early ADS-B IN equipage. A preliminary review by FAA certification and operational approvers of the analyses presented here confirmed that the conclusions are appropriate and that TASAR will be considered a Type B application.},

abstract={Electronic Flight Bags (EFB) are increasingly integral to flight deck information management. A piloted simulation study was conducted at NASA Langley Research Center, one aspect of which was to evaluate the usability and acceptability of EFBs for viewing and managing Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) and data linked aeronautical information services (AIS) and meteorological information (MET). The study simulated approaches and landings at Memphis International Airport (KMEM) using various flight scenarios and weather conditions. Ten two-pilot commercial airline crews participated, utilizing the Cockpit Motion Facility's Research Flight Deck (CMF/RFD) simulator. Each crew completed approximately two dozen flights over a two day period. Two EFBs were installed, one for each pilot. Study data were collected in the form of questionnaire/interview responses, audio/video recordings, oculometer recordings, and aircraft/system state data. Preliminary usability results are reported primarily based on pilot interviews and responses to questions focused on ease of learning, ease of use, usefulness, satisfaction, and acceptability. Analysis of the data from the other objective measures (e.g., oculometer) is ongoing and will be reported in a future publication. This paper covers how the EFB functionality was set up for the study; the NOTAM, AIS/MET data link, and weather messages that were presented; questionnaire results; selected pilot observations; and conclusions.},

abstract={The MITRE Corporation (MITRE) has been researching the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) avionics equipage incentives for a number of years, and through industry and government discussions, we have seen the perspectives of many National Airspace System (NAS) stakeholders. We believe that summary information on these perspectives should be documented and shared, in order to better inform NextGen policy decision making. We see challenges that, if addressed, would improve the chances of government incentive program successes in motivating NextGen equipage investments. We also believe that activities launched as a result of the recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) re-authorization offer an opportunity to advance NextGen equipage. Accordingly, the purpose and key objectives of this paper are: (a) To inform stakeholder decision makers as to options and implications of different incentives strategies, including operational, financial and regulatory approaches, and (b) To illustrate how intended stakeholder behaviors may or may not be influenced by incentives strategies, by providing a hypothetical walk-through of the commercial aircraft operator decision process. The paper concludes with suggested research questions and proposed next steps.},

abstract={Voice communication is a pillar of air traffic management throughout all phases of flight - but nowhere is it as important as during surface operations. Finding space on the frequency to communicate can often times be challenge, especially when operations become irregular during weather events or peak push-times. Ground frequencies can become saturated with controllers providing taxi and clearance instructions to pilots and vehicles. To alleviate saturation, ANSPs have turned to more efficient ways to communicate route and clearance information to aircraft. Many airports around the world are using data link as a means to provide route and clearance instructions to the cockpit without using voice communications. The U.S. FAA's Tower Data Link System (TDLS) has been used for more than a decade to provide route clearance information to pilots via PreDeparture Clearance (PDC) messages. TDLS generates the PDC with data obtained from the HOST or ERAM flight data processor and sends it to a dispatcher working in the airline operations center for airlines using the PDC service. The dispatcher then forwards the PDC directly to the cockpit of equipped aircraft and the pilot via ACARS. PDCs are issued 20 to 30 minutes prior to departure and once issued, revisions cannot be generated. If a revision is necessary, the pilot and controller revert to voice communication to issue and accept the clearance instructions.},

abstract={Honeywell Aerospace performed a research study on behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration's NextGen Human Factors Division to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of manual entry as compared to loadable entry of uplinked clearances into the B-777 flight management system (FMS). Five flight crews flew an experimental scenario with Air Traffic Control (ATC) clearances that included a mix of single uplink messages and concatenated messages. The mean flight crew response time across all conditions was 36.7 seconds without outliers, and 44.5 seconds with outliers. Additionally, 83% of the flight crew responses were received in less than one minute, while 100% percent of their responses were received in less than two minutes. When available, flight crews used the load function (direct loading of a loadable ATC clearance into the FMS) 74% of the time. Flight crew response times for manual versus loadable ATC clearances were not statistically different. The mean response time for concatenated messages was statistically higher than for non-concatenated. Based on the study results, flight deck human machine interface (HMI) recommendations address improvements to (i) the salience of a loadable message; (ii) button logic and menu structure; and (iii) integration of the data communications and FMS interface for clearances containing required times of arrival, including the potential need for flight crew decision support. The study results and recommendations support FAA NextGen operational and certification guidance development by providing information for data communications operational approval considerations, aircraft certification considerations and air traffic operational procedures considerations.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and BrainVentions Corporation, Inc. have conducted a one-year cooperative research agreement to investigate the current state of the art Automatic Speech Semantic Recognition (ASSR) technology, to measure its accuracy, and to explore its potential applications in Air Traffic Control (ATC). The ASSR system used for this study was the ValsVox (BrainVentions) web-based Software as a Service (SaaS) application for real-time speech recognition and semantic parsing of ATC voice communications. Case studies were conducted using the enhanced ValsVox system with recorded audio from previously conducted ATC Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) simulations. The standard speech recognition metric of word error rate was calculated as well as semantic metrics based on the commands issued by the simulation pilots used as the “gold standard” interpretation of the voice clearances. The design of ValsVox is such that the speech recognition is constrained in real-time by the semantic parsing unlike other systems in which a transcript of the utterance is first generated then semantically parsed. For the phrases that were successfully recognized, the accuracy of the semantic recognition as measured against the “gold standard” was over 80%. These findings suggest that the technology may be ready for follow on research to incorporate ASSR into ATC decision support tools. For example, this might include tools that detect mismatches between verbal clearances and keyed commands or to alert the users of incorrect or missing read-backs. There is also a potential to use ASSR in simulation and training environments such as incorporating into simulation pilot workstations to assist overloaded pilots. In addition human transcriptionists could use ValsVox-generated transcripts to save time and costs when complete accuracy is needed.},

abstract={Despite the evolution of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), the technological development on airframes, autopilots, communications and payload, is still limited by the absence of software standardization. Engineers face the development of UAS systems with the implementation of ad-hoc solutions to satisfy the mission requirements. This is a major limitation with regard to the software maintenance and re-usability that may result in an increment of both project cost and risk. Well-structured UAS avionics supporting increased levels of automation (and eventually autonomy), together with reconfiguration capabilities and cost-effectiveness, are key requirements for UAS to be successful in a global scenario. Additionally the major civil applications require UAS with access to non-segregated airspace. Following Eurocontrol, FAA and ICAO philosophy, the introduction of unmanned traffic should not affect ATM operations, thus UAS should comply with the performance levels required by SESAR and NextGen. Hence, operations with unmanned aircraft should guarantee safe and efficient interaction with the ATM system. In that aspect gaps and issues into unmanned aircraft software architectures are discussed in this paper. Required mechanism for ATM communication, collision avoidance, maneuver automation and SESAR/NextGen integration are discussed to identify possible short-term and long-term software requirements. Moreover, existing standardized software frameworks and proposed software proposed are reviewed to identify the gaps it should deal with to achieve an efficient UAS integration.},

abstract={An intelligent second-order sliding-mode control (I2OSMC) using a wavelet fuzzy neural network with an asymmetric membership function (WFNN-AMF) estimator is proposed in this study to control a six-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) for an electric power steering (EPS) system. First, the dynamics of the steer-by-wire (SBW) EPS system and six-phase PMSM drive system with a lumped uncertainty are described in detail. Then, to alleviate the chattering phenomena in a traditional sliding-mode control (SMC), a second-order sliding-mode control (2OSMC) is designed. Moreover, the I2OSMC is developed to improve the required control performance of the EPS system. In the I2OSMC, the WFNN-AMF estimator with accurate approximation capability is employed to estimate the lumped uncertainty. Furthermore, the adaptive learning algorithms for the online training of the WFNN-AMF are derived using the Lyapunov theorem to guarantee the asymptotical stability of the closed-loop system. In addition, a 32-bit floating-point digital signal processor (DSP), i.e., TMS320F28335, is adopted for the implementation of the proposed control approach. Finally, some experimental results are illustrated to demonstrate the validity of the proposed I2OSMC using the WFNN-AMF estimator for the EPS system.},

abstract={MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT LL), in an effort sponsored by the National Center of Atmospheric Research (NCAR), has engaged in the development of C-Band active element phased array front-end hardware for a polarimetric radar application. This polarimetric active element scanning array (AESA) radar, when fully developed, would be deployed on a C-130 for use in Hurricane Hunter-like missions. The combination of mission and platform imposes requirements on the RF hardware that are often in conflict. These specifications include minimum range and resolution, maximum prime power, and a challenging cross-polarization isolation requirement. The RF hardware developed included a dual polarization (pol) radiator test panel, an alternating transmit simultaneous receive (ATSR) transmit/receive (T/R) switch designed and manufactured by M/A-COM Technical Solutions (MTS), a three channel T/R multichip module (MCM), and a four-pack T/R module assembly. This paper describes the mission and platform requirements, presents a notional design for the phased array aperture, discusses the design trades, and provides an overview of the design and performance of the radiator test panel, the MCM and the four-pack T/R module. This work borrowed heavily in terms of materials, technologies, and lessons learned acquired over the past five years from the MPAR Panel [1] development efforts of MIT LL and MTS co-sponsored by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Air Force, and the National Severe Storms Laboratory.},

abstract={An initial study performed for the FAA and NOAA explores dual-polarization implementation options for a multifunction phased array radar (MPAR) that could replace the nation's air and weather surveillance radars. The study focuses on approaches to acquiring polarimetric data and on array geometries, both of which drive phased array costs of an MPAR design. Two dual-polarized approaches are found to result in reasonable phased array polarization purity requirements and costs. One of them (simultaneous collection of Hand V data using orthogonal waveforms) additionally makes efficient use of the radar timeline available for weather observation and hard target search and track missions. Three array geometries-a flat rotating array, a four-faced pyramid, and a commutating cylinder-meet mission requirements, with varying degrees of cost and complexity. A key study finding is that dual-polarized capabilities can be added to MPAR with modest increase in complexity and cost.},

abstract={File Transfer Protocol is the most popular file transfer standard. This FTP can let a computer system connect to the internet via a communication network, and it can also access the system resources from the internet. File server is being downloaded now by TCP/IP protocol, while before it was downloaded by signal server. Due to the limited flow control, the old method could not use download time efficiently. In order to solve the flow control problem, some researchers came up with a distributed file transfer method that can share the document with other users, thus allowing the shortest transfer time using neighboring servers. Although the distributed file transfer can reduce the file transfer time, it was not concerned with the quality of the transfer between two servers, and was inappropriate for file segmentation and transfer, so the file transfer could not attain the optimal transfer efficacy. Based on our research, we propose a new method called Distributed Parallelized File Transfer Protocol (DPFTP). This method is based on Parallelized File Transfer Protocol (P-FTP) and is beneficial to multi-users, as it utilizes server loading and reduces the download time.},

Within the FCI, the L-band has been allocated for air-to-ground communications. Currently, two candidate systems for superseding the analogue voice communication system in the VHF band are taken into consideration. The frst candidate L-band digital aeronautical communications system type 1 (LDACS1) is a broadband system employing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and frequency-division duplex (FDD). LDACS1 has been designed as a combination of P34 (TIA 902 standard) and the broadband aeronautical multicarrier communications system [4]. The second candidate LDACS2 is a narrowband single-carrier system using time-division duplex as duplex scheme. This system is a derivative of the L-band digital link and the all-purpose multichannel aviation communication system.},

abstract={Next generation of automobiles (also known as cybercars) will increasingly incorporate electronic control units (ECUs) to implement various safety-critical functions such as x-by-wire (e.g., steer-by-wire (SBW), brake-by-wire). ISO 26262 specifies automotive safety integrity levels (ASILs) to signify the criticality associated with a function. Meeting a design's ASIL requirements at a minimum additional cost is a major challenge in cybercar design. In this paper, we propose D2Cyber - a design automation tool for cybercars that facilitates designers in selecting dependable designs by providing built-in models, easy to specify inputs, and easy to interpret outputs. D2Cyber considers the effects of temperature, electronics quality grade, and design lifetime in cybercar's design space exploration for determining a cost-effective solution and also advises on the attainable ASIL from a given design. We elaborate Markov models that form the basis of D2Cyber using SBW as a case study. We further provide evaluation insights obtained from D2Cyber.},

abstract={One of the important features of an RFID system is its ability to search for a particular tag among a group of tags. In order to ensure privacy and security of the tags, the search has to be conducted in a secure fashion. To our knowledge not much work has been done in this secure search area of RFID. The minimal work that has been done do not comply with the EPC C1G2 (Class-1 Gen-2) standard since most of them use expensive hash operations or sophisticated encryption schemes that cannot be implemented in the low-cost passive tags that are highly resource constrained. Our work aims to fill this gap by proposing a protocol that is based on simple XOR encryption and 128 bit pseudo random number generators (PRNG), operations that can be easily implemented on low-cost passive tags. Thus, our protocol enables large scale implementations and achieves EPC C1G2 compliance while meeting the security requirements. The protocol provides additional protection by hiding the pseudo-random number during all transmissions using a blind-factor.},

title={Dynamic frame pairing in real-time freehand elastography},
year={2014},
volume={61},
number={6},
pages={979-985},
abstract={Quasi-static ultrasound (US) elastography is now a well-established technique that involves acquiring US (RF/envelope) signals from an imaging plane before and after a small quasi-static compression to form axial strain elastograms (ASE). The image quality of the ASEs is a function of the applied axial strain. This relationship was extensively investigated and formalized in terms of strain filter in the literature. Most of the work in elastography formed elastograms by choosing pre- and post-compression frames separated by a desired compression strain. Although this approach is feasible in simulations and in vitro/in vivo experiments that involve controlled compression, it has been a challenge to do this during freehand compression in real time. In this work, we describe a one-prediction-one- correction method that dynamically selects pre- and post- compression frames to form an elastogram, based on the applied axial strain level. We validate the method using controlled compression experiments on phantoms and compare the performance of the dynamic frame pairing method against successive-frame pairing method in terms of the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNRe). Further, we demonstrate the advantages of the new method with the help of freehand acquired data from phantom experiments and in vivo breast data. The results demonstrate that the frame-pairing identified by the dynamic method matched the frame pairing that was designed to yield an applied axial strain of ~1%. The CNRe obtained by the traditional approach varied from as low as ~5 to as high as ~25, depending on the choice of skip number and compression rate. However, the dynamic frame pairing method provided elastograms with a CNRe that was consistently around ~20, irrespective of the compression rate. The results from analysis of 22 in vivo breast data demonstrated that the dynamic pairing method generated elastograms such that the frame-average axial strain (FAAS) of each frame in the cineloop is consistently ~1% (0.011 ± 0.001).},

abstract={A critical element in relieving airport capacity constraints is to minimize longitudinal spacing between aircraft pairs that are in-trail on final approach. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has defined minimum separation standards that controllers need to follow when directing arrivals during instrument meteorological conditions. Excess Inter-Arrival Time (IAT) between arrivals may occur in addition to the FAA minimum separation standards. This excess time could be due to a number of factors including speed variations between the two aircraft in the arrival pair, pilot techniques, wind speeds and conservative air traffic management. The spacing and distribution of excess IAT between aircraft in instrument approach conditions is an important factor when modeling airport capacities. Current best practices for modeling the distribution of excess IAT is based on 35-year old research. Evaluating these modeling assumptions has been difficult due to a lack of sufficient, reliable data. The recent advent of new tools and the explosion of new, highly accurate data enable a reevaluation of the excess IAT distribution assumptions. This analysis studied 21,752 arrival pairs at seven Traffic Management Advisor-equipped airports. We found that a Log-Normal distribution with a log-mean of 4.27 seconds, a log-standard deviation of 0.25 seconds and shifted by 50 seconds provides a better fit to the observations than the Normal distribution that was previously assumed.},

abstract={This paper describes the infrastructural deficiencies at some non-towered airports, identifies the resulting operational impacts, and briefly explores the use of Integrated Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance (ICNS) capabilities as an improvement mechanism. The purpose is to inform the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) decisions regarding the creation of a more efficient and streamlined National Airspace System (NAS). The inefficiencies at non-towered airports can be attributed to the coverage gaps in surveillance and communication in the vicinity of the airport that limit the type and number of services that can be provided by Air Traffic Control (ATC). The result is adverse impacts to operations, framed as shortfalls, in the following categories: flight delay, extended flight paths, and safety. A rough order of magnitude estimate is provided in operational terms (e.g., delay minutes, minutes of excess flying time, fatalities) for each shortfall, leveraging current flight data, surveillance data, and safety data. In conclusion, this paper describes the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the analysis and discusses the application of this analysis to non-towered airports throughout the NAS.},

abstract={The System Wide Information Management (SWIM) program is one of the critical components in the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) NextGen project. This investigates some of the challenges that arise during communication between the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) and the Data Management System (DMS). The FAA has identified nine operational scenarios (OS) detailing information exchange within the context of the AAtS between the DMS and the aircraft. The FAA has also identified three technical scenarios (TS) for communication between an aircraft and the DMS for conveying the NAS information. This study is limited to the downlink (information from the aircraft to the DMS) portion of the EFB-DMS interaction. Additionally, we do not investigate NAS-DMS interaction. We implemented a replicated network infrastructure to mimic the functionality of the Aircraft Access to SWIM (AAtS) and the SWIM components relevant to the research. In this environment, the behavior of the entire system is emulated with approximated specifications. We implemented three messaging patterns (MPs), namely, DMS Hosting Request-Response Web Service, DMS Hosting Pub-Sub Service using Java Messaging Service (JMS), and DMS Hosting Pub-Sub with Web Service Notification in the replicated network and tested them against recommended OS-TS combinations. Several message sizes and frequencies of occurrence were used for testing selected combinations. We performed the tests using three different data sizes under full bandwidth contention and no bandwidth contention. Our tests suggest that the selected combinations can work and deliver the desired performance within the available data link bandwidth. The test outcomes also assist in determining which OS-TS-MP combinations are optimal.},

abstract={The purpose of this study is to explore the current status and future challenges of Airport/Surface - Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) implementations, explain the diversity of experiences and different managerial approaches that are mediating in the implementation processes in Europe and the US and propose a framework of best practices for the future. This is done by comparing past historical, operational, and cost-benefit analysis approaches in both continents. The main differences in implementation processes are examined in order to identify common and differentiating aspects in terms of factors of influence. At the backdrop of this study, the authors recognize how many initiatives have been slowed down or stalled due to lack of agreement, communication, or accountability of the involved actors. In order to capture the varying outcomes of past experiences, his study has followed a multi-case study design methodology with various data sources. Findings show different perceptions on implementation factors and motivations for success in both continents, and also between different industries. Results show that a number of issues are inherent to the technological complexity and structural organizations in specific aerospace organizations, but some major aspects as communications, leadership, funding and operation maturity are common to all of them. Finally, a set of recommendations is proposed based on change management techniques to improve CDM implementation in the future.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) initiated the mission to transition Traffic Management Advisor (TMA, also referred to as the “legacy” system) into a new system. The legacy system provided computer automation to enhance the arrival/departure throughput and efficiency of air traffic operations in extended terminal airspace surrounding major airports, and in en-route airspace. The resulting system re-architecture enhancement upgrades the system architecture to: reduce cost of ownership; reduce the logistical footprint; maintain compatibility of hardware and software; comply with system performance requirements; and to increase the flexibility of workstations.The solution proposed, developed, implemented and now in deployment the Time-Based Flow Management (TBFM) System. This system consolidated the servers resulting in a server footprint reduction of 70%. This approach had the lowest risk to the system from a hardware change perspective; however, it did have some inherent limitations and risks. The software needed to be tweaked to ensure performance was met on the consolidated server, which was more difficult as the number of airports adapted expanded, as more and more functionality is added to the system, and as additional subsystems are created outside of the standard TBFM software (i.e. SOA Enterprise Bus). Additionally, the new hardware must be installed at each site in a new rack, spares for those servers need to be allocated both locally and at the nationwide depot, and any future expansion hardware would need to be installed at each site.},

year={2014},
volume={},
number={},
pages={L2-1-L2-13},
abstract={As NextGen concepts seek increasing airport throughput, separation from naturally occurring wake turbulence becomes a limiting factor in the pursuit of capacity improvements in many cases. In recent years, the implementation of fixed procedural changes that reduce wake separations while maintaining safety have been very successful. Further opportunities for reducing wake constraints have led to exploiting specific meteorological conditions to mitigate wake hazards. As an example, one such program, entitled Wake Turbulence Mitigation for Departures, ensures safe reduction of successive departure separations based on dynamic crosswind conditions. Availability of these conditions, however, is limited by the abilities of the wind detection system - its sensing ability, data reliability and forecasting accuracy. Recent efforts are addressing these limitations by exploring how the use of better knowledge of wind and aircraft performance can increase availability or enable the design of further wake turbulence mitigation arrival and departure procedures. Additionally, recent advancements in aircraft flight track data assimilation have led to a deeper understanding of aircraft operational behavior during landing and take-off cycles. The confluence of these efforts is currently being leveraged to develop more sophisticated wake mitigation applications. This paper provides an overview of recent progress in developing broad data access and collection of weather and aircraft positional data; prospective applications that would leverage these data; and the relationship between the data density, or supply-side, requirements and the associated application demand needs.},

abstract={This paper proposes a methodology developed to determine End-to-End (E-2-E) Data Link performance concentrating on the Tower and En Route domains. This methodology was developed to support the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)'s Data Communications (Data Comm) program in allocating performance requirements. The Data Comm program is part of the FAA's NextGen initiative to implement advanced communication capabilities in the National Airspace (NAS). The methodology can be potentially applied to other Data Link systems. The paper provides an overview of an aviation Data Link system, including high-level system architecture and a summarized description of sample transactions of some of the services to be provided. To calculate E-2-E performance for transactions, the threads involved in the transaction are presented as groups of subsystems in series. Each group of subsystems is assigned a performance measure and then the total performance is aggregated to arrive at the E-2-E performance. The paper lists the key strategies and assumptions used in developing the mathematical models and descriptions of performance measures. The proposed performance measures analyzed are focused on the Required Communications Technical Performance (RCTP) portion of the service which does not include human interaction, and addresses measures such as Reliability, Maintainability and Availability (RMA), Timing (Latency), and Integrity. Sample calculations for these performance measures are provided, using examples of allocation across multiple components and system threads. The methodology supports the assessment of compliance of proposed solutions to meet system performance and safety requirements such as those stated in the FAA regulations [1], RTCA performance document [2] and ICAO Standards and Recommended Practice (SARPS) document [3].},

pages={Q3-1-Q3-14},
abstract={This paper describes a framework developed at MITRE for dimensioning a Very High Frequency (VHF) Digital Link Mode 2 (VDL-2) Air-to-Ground network. This framework was developed to support the FAA's Data Communications (Data Comm) program by providing estimates of expected capacity required for the air-ground network services that will support Controller-Pilot-Data-Link Communications (CPDLC), as well as the spectrum needed to operate the system at required levels of performance. The Data Comm program is part of the FAA's NextGen initiative to implement advanced communication capabilities in the National Airspace System (NAS). The first component of the framework is the radio-frequency (RF) coverage design for the network ground stations. Then we proceed to describe the approach used to assess the aircraft geographical distribution and the data traffic demand expected in the network. The next step is the resource allocation utilizing optimization algorithms developed in MITRE's Spectrum ProspectorTM tool to propose frequency assignment solutions, and a NASA-developed VDL-2 tool to perform simulations and determine whether a proposed plan meets the desired performance requirements. The framework presented is capable of providing quantitative estimates of multiple variables related to the air-ground network, in order to satisfy established coverage, capacity and latency performance requirements. Outputs include: coverage provided at different altitudes; data capacity required in the network, aggregated or on a per ground station basis; spectrum (pool of frequencies) needed for the system to meet a target performance; optimized frequency plan for a given scenario; expected performance given spectrum available; and, estimates of throughput distributions for a given scenario. We conclude with a discussion aimed at providing insight into the tradeoffs and challenges identified with respect to radio resource management for VDL-2 air-ground networks.},

abstract={This paper describes an approach for enhancing the network performance of the air-ground (A/G) portion of the National Airspace System (NAS) data communications (Data Comm) network when multiple frequencies are used per ground station (GS), and the expected aircraft and data traffic for each location is known. The main point made in this paper is that, in a scenario with multiple frequencies per GS, one can achieve better system performance by carefully allocating aircraft to each frequency, as opposed to having each frequency have an equal share of the traffic or by using one frequency to its maximum capacity before offloading to the next. The algorithms for assigning aircraft to GSs were developed initially with a focus for implementation on simulated scenarios, but could potentially be applied in actual field scenarios, a topic to be explored in future studies. The work described in this paper builds on the evolving Spectrum Dimensioning and Optimization framework developed at The MITRE Corporation [1]. The framework was designed to address the dimensioning and optimization of a radio frequency (RF) network for A/G Data Comm. The Data Comm program is a key part of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)'s Next Generation Air Transportation (NextGen) initiative to implement and modernize A/G communications and air traffic management (ATM) capabilities in the NAS.},

abstract={An experimental payload with Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) dual frequency (978MHZ and 1090 MHz) receive/record and transmit capability was launched on a commercial stratospheric balloon from Tillamook, Oregon in December 2013 to a float altitude of 95,000 feet. During its time aloft the payload successfully received ADS-B messages from over 320 aircraft from up to 300 miles away. It also received Traffic Information Service-Broadcast (TIS-B) messages during ascent and descent and FIS-B messages at all times (including while at float altitude) from ADS-B ground based transceivers. During flight the payload and balloon were tracked remotely at all times in real-time using its ADS-B Out capability. The experiment results will be discussed. 1) The experiment demonstrates the potential of high altitude balloon flight as a credible risk reduction path for testing of ADS-B receivers in either or both frequencies that will be hosted on any orbital and/or suborbital platform . 2) The experiment results inform the potential of ADS-B In for utilization by crews of both manned stratospheric balloons and suborbital reusable launch vehicles. A planned follow on experiment with a stratospheric balloon using lessons learned from this experiment is also discussed.},

abstract={A wavelet fuzzy neural network using asymmetric membership function (WFNN-AMF) with improved differential evolution (IDE) algorithm is proposed in this study to control a six-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) for an electric power steering (EPS) system. First, the dynamics of a steer-by-wire EPS system and a six-phase PMSM drive system are described in detail. Moreover, the WFNN-AMF controller, which combines the advantages of wavelet decomposition, fuzzy logic system, and asymmetric membership function (AMF), is developed to achieve the required control performance of the EPS system for the improvement of stability of the vehicle and the comfort of the driver. Furthermore, the online learning algorithm of WFNN-AMF is derived using back-propagation method. However, degenerated or diverged responses will be resulted due to the inappropriate selection of small or large learning rates of the WFNN-AMF. Therefore, an IDE algorithm is proposed to online adapt the learning rates of WFNN-AMF. In addition, a 32-bit floating-point digital signal processor, TMS320F28335, is adopted for the implementation of the proposed intelligent controlled EPS system. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed WFNN-AMF controller with IDE for the EPS system is verified through experimental results.},

abstract={An intelligent complementary sliding mode control (ICSMC) is proposed in this study for the fault tolerant control of a six-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive system with open phases. First, the dynamics of the six-phase PMSM drive system with a lumped uncertainty is described in detail. Then, the fault detection and operating decision method are briefly introduced. Moreover, to improve the required control performance and to maintain the stability of the six-phase PMSM drive system under faulty condition, the ICSMC is developed. In this approach, a TSK type fuzzy neural network with asymmetric membership function (TSKFNN-AMF) estimator with accurate approximation capability is employed to estimate the lumped uncertainty. Furthermore, the adaptive learning algorithms for the online training of the TSKFNN-AMF are derived using the Lyapunov theorem to guarantee the closed-loop stability. In addition, to enhance the control performance of the proposed intelligent fault tolerant control, a 32-bit floating-point digital signal processor (DSP), TMS320F28335, is adopted for the implementation of the proposed fault tolerant control system. Finally, some experimental results are illustrated to demonstrate the validity of the proposed fault tolerant control for the six-phase PMSM drive system via ICSMC.},

title={Design of a single pilot cockpit for airline operations},
year={2014},

pages={210-215},
abstract={Rising fuel and operating expenses for commercial airline operators coupled with a predicted pilot labor shortage drives the need for a reduction in costs while continuing to service passengers. One possible solution to reduce recurring costs and mitigate the effects of a pilot shortage is the transition to a single pilot cockpit. Three different design alternatives for implementing a single pilot cockpit in commercial domestic jetliners were identified: the no change option represented by a two pilot cockpit, a single pilot with no additional support, and a single pilot with an onboard support system that automates some of the removed copilot roles. Design alternatives were evaluated using three models: (1) life-cycle cost, (2) reliability, and the (3) processing times for flight procedures based on a human processor simulation. The lifecycle cost model was used to determine the savings generated by a single pilot cockpit. Reliability analysis was done to establish failure rates relative to the target level of safety. A human performance model was developed to evaluate the time on task for each task in the Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) for each alternative. The procedure models were decomposed into component tasks and actions required to complete the procedure. The ranking of alternative designs during utility/cost analysis was found to be (1) the no change option, (2) the single pilot with an onboard support system, and (3) the single pilot with no additional support. We found a tradeoff between the two pilot utility and single pilot with onboard support through cost savings. Based on the analysis of results, the single pilot with an onboard support system was judged to have the best chance for becoming a realistic single pilot cockpit system which will reduce recurring airline operating costs, maintain or improve flight safety, and maintain airline serviceability.},

abstract={United States consumption of fossil fuels has been increasing at a rate of 8.4% since 1990 and is expected to grow by 28% from 2011 to 2040. Executive Order 13514, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy and Economic Performance, sets sustainability goals for federal agencies to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. The Federal Aviation Administration has over 4,300 registered vehicles in its motor fleet, and must reduce its emissions by 12.3% by 2020. This system provides an analysis of the life cycle costs and emissions reduction of the motor vehicle fleet at the William J. Hughes Technical Center. The analysis includes alternatives of low speed electric vehicles, neighborhood electric vehicles, and compressed natural gas vehicles. Three models are used to do analysis: (1) the demand model is a discrete-event simulation, used to determine the inventory needed to meet demand. Examples of demand events are mail delivery, and material shipping. The demand model's input is a vehicle inventory, and its outputs are metrics measuring the inventory's ability to meet demand. (2) A life cycle cost model composed of a deterministic and stochastic portions. The deterministic portion calculates preventive maintenance, overhead, and acquisition costs. The stochastic piece is a Monte Carlo simulation that projects energy consumption costs, corrective maintenance costs, and CO2 emissions through 2020. (3) A utility analysis to compare alternatives. Preliminary results indicate that the status quo inventory will not meet the requirements for GHG emission reduction. However, by reducing inventory and introducing electric vehicles, the requirements can be met while staying within current operating budgets. Based on the preliminary results, it is recommended that the FAA gradually introduce electric vehicles on an annual basis into their inventory to meet their sustainment goals by 2020.},

pages={304-309},
abstract={The need for increased surveillance due to increase in flight volume in remote or oceanic regions outside the range of traditional radar coverage has been fulfilled by the advent of space-based Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) Surveillance systems. ADS-B systems have the capability of providing air traffic controllers with highly accurate real-time flight data. ADS-B is dependent on digital communications between aircraft and ground stations of the air route traffic control center (ARTCC); however these communications are not secured. Anyone with the appropriate capabilities and equipment can interrogate the signal and transmit their own false data; this is known as spoofing. The possibility of this type of attacks decreases the situational awareness of United States airspace. The purpose of this project is to design a secure transmission framework that prevents ADS-B signals from being spoofed. Three alternative methods of securing ADS-B signals are evaluated: hashing, symmetric encryption, and asymmetric encryption. Security strength of the design alternatives is determined from research. Feasibility criteria are determined by comparative analysis of alternatives. Economic implications and possible collision risk is determined from simulations that model the United State airspace over the Gulf of Mexico and part of the airspace under attack respectively. The ultimate goal of the project is to show that if ADS-B signals can be secured, the situational awareness can improve and the ARTCC can use information from this surveillance system to decrease the separation between aircraft and ultimately maximize the use of the United States airspace.},

abstract={The growing ubiquity and pervasiveness of sensors and smart devices, with the consequent availability of a large amount of "local" and contextualized information, are giving rise to a wealth of "context-aware" applications and services. In this work we consider an opportunistic communication scheme called Floating Content (FC), which was specifically designed for serverless distributed context-aware applications. So far, the performance analysis of FC, and in particular of content lifetime and availability, was based on simplified system models and fluid system analysis. The resulting performance estimates did not account for the effects of propagation characteristics, mobility patterns, and communication protocols, all factors known to significantly affect the performance of opportunistic communication schemes. This article studies the main issues related to the performance of FC service in a realistic office setting through a first experimental evaluation of a mobile app for Android devices. Our experimental results confirm the feasibility of FC service for supporting practical context-aware mobile applications in office settings.},

abstract={Mobile phone is now becoming a necessary gadget in our daily life. Mobile applications have been proposed to advance the function of mobile phone. Location service application is a kind of mobile application that provides location information such as current location of the mobile phone. GPS is the popular technology for location service on mobile phone because many models of mobile phone are embedded with GPS sensor. Although GPS can provide high accuracy over outdoor scenario, GPS cannot provide good accuracy in indoor environment because the GPS signal from GPS satellites is blocked by the structure of building. The indoor localization systems have been proposed to address the above-mentioned problem. Many indoor localization systems require costly back-end server to process location. Moreover, the devices need to connect to the back-end servers to request the service. In this paper, we propose a serverless indoor localization system for mobile phone platform. The proposed system does not need any support from back-end server. The localization is processed on mobile phone. The system is developed as an Android application, utilizing Wi-Fi signal to determine the current location of mobile phone and uses mobile ad hoc network to disseminate the current location to other users in the system. The proposed system achieves accuracy up to 83.43% when the system is deployed in the two-floors building, which is the experimental site.},

abstract={It is undisputed that number of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) will increase in the coming years. Small unmanned aerial scientific remote sensing systems or “data drones” have great potential to assist the human race with difficult problems such as water management and biofuel production, provided these systems can be integrated properly into society and airspace. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ideally will present rules for integrating UASs into National Aerospace System (NAS) by 2015. Ethics, safety, and data quality are the fundamental architectural components required for successful operation of autonomous aerial remote sensing systems, enabling integration into society and ultimately providing the benefits of these emerging technologies. In aviation, safety is the primary concern. In case of UAS and Personal Remote Sensing (PRS), the sole purpose of flight is to collect data; thus data is the Mission (i.e., the sole reason for airspace usage). Ethical principles for collection of information and personal privacy must also be included, to justify the use of UASs in civil (public) airspace while upholding the rights expected by civilians. Policies, standards, and agreements on architecture are necessary for producing systems which adhere to these fundamentals; aerial systems must include these basic properties in their designs to allow for lasting harmony between society and unmanned systems. In this paper, it is shown that any architecture which accomplishes this integration task must be compliant with the Architecture for Ethical Remote Information Sensing (AERIS) requirements. Several existing consumer-grade SUASs are evaluated based on these criteria and suggestions for AERIS compliance are given.},

abstract={With the proliferation of unmanned aircraft systems in the marketplace and demand for their services, commercial unmanned aircraft systems developers and operators, both large and small have begun to engage in commercial operation of unmanned aircraft at low altitudes, while there has been little assertion that unmanned operations are not subject to jurisdiction of the Federal Aviation Administration within air space above certain minimum altitudes prescribed for flight. Many developers and operators have done so without any authorization or licensing on the assumption that no authorization is required because the Federal Aviation Administration lacks the jurisdiction to regulate operations of unmanned aircraft at low altitudes. While a recent decision by the National Transportation Safety Board dismissed an enforcement complaint against an operator of a small unmanned aircraft at low altitudes, it is unlikely that the Board or a Federal court will find that the agency lacks jurisdiction over operations at low altitudes. Other unmanned aircraft operators have sought authorization through the very limited and commercially restrictive approval mechanisms currently developed for testing and integrating unmanned aircraft into the national air space. Noncommercial recreational use of model aircraft have been covered by a separate Federal Aviation Administration policy and are not the focus of this article.},

In the first stage, a score model, focusing on the non-financial aspects, uses the Go-Kill threshold value to determine whether a project can be further appraised in the next stage. In the second stage, a fuzzy programming model, addressing the financial aspects, is used to select the optimal combinations from the go-projects of the first stage.

abstract={This paper describes a novel binocular camera system for tracking aircraft in the low-altitude, visual segment of departure. Recent economic pressures and changing Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations have raised concern that obstacle clearance requirements are not being met on departure. Moreover, local airport procedures do not always align with the requirements for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPs) established by the FAA. The flight track data collected by this system will be used by the FAA to assess the magnitude of the problem and determine steps to align airport and TERPs procedures, while also mitigating obstacle clearance violations.},

pages={1361-1365},
abstract={We propose a general approach to construct cryptographic significant Boolean functions of (r + 1)m variables based on the additive decomposition F2rm × F2m of the finite field F2(r+1)m, where r ≥ 1 is odd and m ≥ 3. A class of unbalanced functions is constructed first via this approach, which coincides with a variant of the unbalanced class of generalized Tu-Deng functions in the case r = 1. Functions belonging to this class have high algebraic degree, but their algebraic immunity does not exceed m, which is impossible to be optimal when r > 1. By modifying these unbalanced functions, we obtain a class of balanced functions which have optimal algebraic degree and high nonlinearity (shown by a lower bound we prove). These functions have optimal algebraic immunity provided a combinatorial conjecture on binary strings which generalizes the Tu-Deng conjecture is true. Computer investigations show that, at least for small values of number of variables, functions from this class also behave well against fast algebraic attacks.},

abstract={Recent generalisations of stochastic filtering methods to multi-object systems have become very popular for solving multi-target tracking problems over the last decade. However, there was previously no general means of introducing correlations between objects. In this article, we investigate generalisations of such multi-object filters for systems where there may be dependencies between objects. Determining probability and factorial moment densities is facilitated by the use of a recent result in variational calculus, a general form of Faà di Bruno's formula. The result is illustrated through the Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter, as a first-order moment example of the general form.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel analytical approach to the analysis of the queuing delay and medium access distribution of carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA-CA) protocols over multihop personal area networks (MPANs). The proposed approach considers a general case without restrictions on the topology, traffic generation patterns, or multipath routing policy, and it accounts for heterogeneous traffic patterns, all possible packet loss scenarios, and the effect of the length of the backoff on the channel assessment. This paper uses statistical theorems to derive the moment generating function (mgf) of the time required to service a packet and then uses this function as a service distribution in a GI/G/1 queuing model to derive the interdeparture and total queuing delays. From these functions, the end-to-end delay, jitter, throughput, and failure transmission probability over a path are derived. In addition to determining these metrics, this paper exploits the statistical features of the mgf to determine the rare-event probability of the service function. The proposed approach is exemplified using the state-of-the-art IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA-CA protocol, and its accuracy is demonstrated through comparison with simulations.},

abstract={An intelligent controlled three-phase squirrel-cage induction generator (SCIG) system for grid-connected wind power applications using hybrid wavelet fuzzy neural network (WFNN) is proposed in this study. First, the indirect field-oriented mechanism is implemented for the control of the SCIG system. Then, an AC/DC power converter and a DC/AC power inverter are developed to convert the electric power generated by a three-phase SCIG to power grid. Moreover, the dynamic model of the SCIG system and an ideal computed torque controller are developed for the control of the square of DC-link voltage. Furthermore, an intelligent hybrid WFNN controller and two WFNN controllers, which are computation intensive approaches, are proposed for the AC/DC power converter and the DC/AC power inverter respectively to improve the transient and steady-state responses of the SCIG system at different operating conditions. In the intelligent hybrid WFNN controller, to relax the requirement of the lumped uncertainty in the design of the ideal computed torque controller, a WFNN is designed as an uncertainty observer to adapt the lumped uncertainty online. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the SCIG system for grid-connected wind power applications is verified with experimental results.},

abstract={Redundant design in layer 2 networks gives rise to problems such as mislearning of MAC addresses, broadcast storms and multiple frame copies. To prevent this IEEE 802.1d Spanning tree protocol is used. Spanning tree protocol removes the redundant links by disabling the ports to which the redundant links are connected. When the active link goes down the spanning tree protocol has to be executed again to place a redundant connection as active link. This causes convergence issues. Port Channels allows grouping of several Ethernet links to create one logical connection. In this paper we have used the redundant links between switches as port channels thereby making the switch to believe that there is only one connection instead of multiple physical connections to a switch thereby spanning tree protocol is never executed. Experimental analysis also showed that using port channels to eliminate layer 2 loops causes increase in bandwidth, enables load balancing and faster convergence between the links in the network.},

This task is one of the most difficult and critical in ensuring the safety of commercial air travel for the public. There are several factors that contribute to the difficulty. X-ray imaging aptitude testing (X-APT) is focused on the individual aptitudes that are influential in acquiring, performing and retaining the perceptual and cognitive skills that are associated with the airport check-point X-ray threat detection. X-APT is a computer based battery of assessment tests derived from validated psychometric assessment tools. The battery is presented on a self-contained portable Tablet, with interactive graphics to increase user engagement. A pilot study of the X-APT prototype was conducted with current Transportation Security Administration X-ray imaging operators to refine and validate the system design. A full scale field evaluation is being conducted at several major airports. The evaluation compares X-APT performance aptitude based predictions with archived image analysis performance results. X-APT provides a valid tool for selection and classification of security personnel, and has the potential to enable self-paced training and skills improvement.},

abstract={Software safety standards are commonly used to guide the development of safety-critical software systems. However, given the existence of multiple competing standards, it is critical to select the most appropriate one for a given project. We have developed a set of 15 criteria to evaluate each standard in terms of its usage, strengths, and limitations. Five standards are studied, including a NASA Software Safety Standard, an FAA System Safety Handbook, MIL-STD-882D (US Department of Defense), DEF-STAN 00-56 (UK Ministry of Defense), and DO-178B (Commercial avionics). Results of our evaluation suggest that different standards score differently with respect to each evaluation criterion. No standard performs better than others on all the criteria. The lessons learned from software-related accidents in which the standards were involved provide further insights on the pros and cons of using each standard.},

This paper presents the design and fabrication of a radar sensor designed for use as part of a reactive path planning system. The radar is a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) type with two receive channels. This enables monopulse processing to provide both range and bearing information of detected targets. Without connectors or antennas, it weighs 46 g, is 7.6 × 5 × 3.8 cm in size, and costs less than $100 when built in quantities of 100 or more. The radar has been tested using outdoor targets and is currently being integrated with a UAS autopilot and collision avoidance algorithm for airborne testing.},

abstract={Airports GIS is a web portal which hosts a few application modules. It allows authorized Airports GIS users to submit changes to airport data. One of these modules in Airports GIS is electronic Airport Layout Plan (eALP). This application helps airports create their digital Airport Layout Plans. The layout view capability in this module is provided by ESRI's ArcGIS server. The initial phase of testing a few eALPs across the nation as a pilot program initiative is over and valuable lessons are learned from this activity. We expect this application will go to production sometimes next year. It will take several years before most or all airports in USA have their digital Airport Layout Plans. During this transition period we are storing legacy Airport Layout Plans in Cloud. These Layout Plans are basically in pdf form. Plans to catalogue these Layout Plans and provide access to users are being implemented. Airports GIS also hosts another Survey module. As part of this module requirement, we collect airport imagery for almost every submitted airport project to Airports GIS. We have already archived some of these ortho images in Cloud. This gives the ability to users to take advantage of ESRI's ArcGIS viewer to analyze and manage these imageries. These ortho images are large in size. In future, we will receive a lot more ortho images because the number of airports who submit this data is growing and the size of each ortho image is also growing. Hence, it needs special care to organize and access these imageries. Once completed, this will have significant impact on airport planning and budgeting.},

abstract={UAV technology has begun to integrate into the National Airspace (NAS), at an accelerated rate. Coupled with a high demand for civilian UAS applications and decreasing component prices, more UAS researchers, commercial operators, and manufacturers begin to fly. Despite a lack of government mandated insurance requirements and mission profiles deemed dull, dirty, and dangerous, the UAS industry is gaining momentum. However, as the UAV industry matures, unmanned aircraft will inevitably crash. In anticipation of these growing pains, insurance carriers must be ready. Unmanned aircraft present a unique matrix of risk endemic to the challenges of flight in the NAS. Underwriters and actuaries will be able to provide peace of mind to pilots and bystanders alike. Insurers must design policies to properly allocate liability and provide a safety net. UAS-tailored coverage will identify and quantify the unique characteristics of unmanned aircraft. Underwriters have just begun to adapt insurance products to suit the needs of the nascent sector. This analysis will outline the process of insuring UAS. Further, it will highlight how insurance companies should cope with the dynamic forces within the UAV market.},

abstract={Change impact analysis is increasingly challenging for enterprise applications due to that applications in an enterprise portfolio usually heavily depend on each other and also grow rapidly in both of scale and complexity. Automatic impact analysis based on intra- and inter-application dependencies implies potential impact propagation directions. However, due to the variety and complexity of dependencies, determining real impacts is intelligence intensive and usually needs interventions of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) on each involved application. In this paper, to enable a more agile enterprise application evolution, we propose and implement a collaborative change impact analysis approach which effectively coordinates involvements and incorporates insights of relevant SMEs. In the approach, we first construct an initial collaborative change impact analysis roadmap based on application dependencies. Then, we iteratively invite and coordinate relevant SMEs based on the roadmap, and then leverage their insights to dynamically refine the roadmap. The evaluations on real enterprise applications show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has used a ground coupled Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) at the National Airport Pavement Test Facility (NAPTF) since 2005. One of the primary objectives of the testing at the facility is to provide full-scale pavement response and failure information for use in airplane landing gear design and configuration studies. During the traffic testing at the facility, a GSSI GPR system was used to develop new procedures for monitoring Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) pavement density changes that is directly related to pavement failure. After reviewing current setups for data acquisition software and procedures for identifying different pavement layers, dielectric constant and pavement thickness were selected as dominant parameters controlling HMA properties provided by GPR. A new methodology showing HMA density changes in terms of dielectric constant variations, called dielectric sweep test, was developed and applied in full-scale pavement test. The dielectric constant changes were successfully monitored with increasing airplane traffic numbers. The changes were compared to pavement performance data (permanent deformation). The measured dielectric constants based on the known HMA thicknesses were also compared with computed dielectric constants using an equation from ASTM D4748-98.},

abstract={The proposed 6-Hop P2P (6-Hop) is an improved overlay network topology that intends to enhance the current P2P that houses a file sharing and media broadcasting (FSMB) application. A P2P system provides a serverless platform for the current FSMB application. It allows media files in each peer to be located by other peers in the network using any word in the file name. The current FSMB application is a closed system where only registered peers can join the overlay network. However, the current broadcasting system has shown some aspects of inefficiency. Two principle weaknesses identified are as follow: query messages flood the overlay network which taking up the bandwidth of the network; and, the search service is not reliable. When a new peer joins the P2P-based FSMB system, registered peers will randomly join clusters in the network. When a peer queries a specific or part of a file name, the current P2P examine all the peers and all the files in each peer. This has resulted in low recall rate and heavy query messages in the overlay network. The proposed 6-Hop P2P is an overlay network that adopts small-world characteristics attempting to improve the recall rate and to reduce the amount of query messages. The proposed P2P is designed using the "similarity interest" value to reduce unnecessary routing and to cut down the number of hops required by the search. It also rewires peers base on recall-rate learning algorithm to form clusters relying on the `interest' bit value of QRP table. This paper presents the proposed 6-Hop model and the work-in-progress results with a short discussion on its prototype.},

abstract={Brain tumor segmentation is an importance process in surgical and treatment planning in medicine. There are various intensity based techniques which have been proposed to segment homogeneous tumors on magnetic resonance images (MRI). Those still fail to segment homogeneous tumor against similar background, isointense signal, weak edges or diffused edges. These problems lead to oversegmentation by intensity based techniques. This paper presents a cellular automaton (CA) based on Gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) for determining the local transition function. This aims to extract the texture feature of MRI brain tumor being used for brain tumor segmentation. The state-of-art segmentation methods, namely, Tumor-Cut (TC) and active contours driven by local Gaussian distribution fitting energy (LGD), are compared the results between intensity image and the proposed texture-based image. For performance evaluation, MRI tumor datasets acquired from virtual skeleton database (VSD) are experimented throughout. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Jaccard coefficient (JC) are employed to measure the overlapping region between tumor ground truth and segmentation results. In this regard, TC and LGD algorithms using the proposed texture feature provide the better results. TC with the proposed texture feature provides the best result with DSC and JC at 91.89% and 85.08%, respectively.},

abstract={This paper describes the integration, evaluation, and results from a high-fidelity human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation of key NASA Air Traffic Management Technology Demonstration - 1 (ATD-1) technologies implemented in an enhanced version of the FAA's Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) platform. These ATD-1 technologies include: (1) a NASA enhanced version of the FAA's Time-Based Flow Management, (2) a NASA ground-based automation technology known as controller-managed spacing (CMS), and (3) a NASA advanced avionics airborne technology known as flight-deck interval-management (FIM). These ATD-1 technologies have been extensively tested in large-scale HITL simulations using general-purpose workstations to study air transportation technologies. These general-purpose workstations perform multiple functions and are collectively referred to as the Multi-Aircraft Control System (MACS). Researchers at NASA Ames Research Center and Raytheon collaborated to augment the STARS platform by including CMS and FIM advisory tools to validate the feasibility of integrating these automation enhancements into the current FAA automation infrastructure. NASA Ames acquired three STARS terminal controller workstations, and then integrated the ATD-1 technologies. HITL simulations were conducted to evaluate the ATD-1 technologies when using the STARS platform. These results were compared with the results obtained when the ATD-1 technologies were tested in the MACS environment. Results collected from the numerical data show acceptably minor differences, and, together with the subjective controller questionnaires showing a trend towards preferring STARS, validate the ATD-1/STARS integration.},

abstract={Airborne Execution of Flow Strategies (AEFS) promotes increased collaboration among National Airspace System (NAS) stakeholders. AEFS recognizes the following current problem: Air Traffic Controllers are aware of the overall air traffic and flight conditions, but lack the capability to collaboratively communicate handling preferences based on flight operators' business needs, whereas flight operators have limited awareness of Air Traffic Control (ATC) constraints and their potential impacts on flights. By promoting methods to increase collaboration between flight operators and ATC, AEFS targets improvements in Traffic Flow Management (TFM) efficiency, situational awareness among stakeholders, and flexibility in the usage of the NAS. The FAA conducted research and development of the AEFS concept at the Florida NextGen Test Bed (FTB) at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona FL. Project staff demonstrated the AEFS operational scenarios and corresponding use cases through laboratory demonstration as well as Modeling and Simulation (M&S). The objective of this paper is to describe the M&S framework, the use cases and trade studies to be evaluated, and the initial results of the effectiveness of the AEFS concept. The FAA selected Mosaic ATM's Metroplex Simulation Environment (MSE) as the framework for this effort. MSE is a state-of-the-art fast-time simulation tool, which is used for modeling airspace and airport conditions in order to perform planning, evaluation, and decision-making processes. MSE has the capability to execute What-if scenarios, in which users are able to modify variables and/or conditions to simulate specific events. Through MSE, researchers are able to emulate current and future airspace configuration and utilization as well as airport conditions to assess the impact of changes to the infrastructure or operations, such as AEFS. AEFS M&S activities augment the laboratory demonstrations in several ways. Fast-time simulation vastly increases the number of sensitivity runs and analysis that project staff can perform. Additionally, MSE includes AEFS functions, such as TBFM Maximum Delay, and TBFM Delay Estimator/What-If that were not included in the lab demonstrations. The FAA can explore these functions more cost effectively through M&S to evaluate their effectiveness.},

abstract={This paper presents modeling of miles-in-trail passback restrictions for use in air traffic management. Generally, FAA managers employ miles-in-trail as a traffic management initiative when downstream traffic congestion at airports or in sectors is anticipated. In order to successfully implement the miles-in-trail at airspace fixes or navigational aids, it is desired that restriction values be computed for passing back to upstream facilities at specific boundaries. This paper presents a model which can be used for that purpose. This model improves on a previous version using traffic manager feedback resulting in significant improvement in guidance. The modeling approach is described along with lessons learned and improvements made during model development. Results for two sample traffic and one real traffic scenarios are presented. Additional operational considerations required by the traffic managers to implement the passback restrictions, namely maximum ground delay and absorbable airborne delay are incorporated in the model. A main result of this research is that absorbing small amount of ground and airborne delays are sufficient to handle the imposed constraint. Another finding is that implementing the passback restrictions provides the traffic managers ways to alleviate traffic constraints to help reduce excessive airborne delay for current traffic conditions.},

title={NextGen architectures to include pilots in collaborative decision making},
year={2014},
volume={},

pages={1E1-1-1E1-13},
abstract={Currently, flight crews are cutoff from much of the in-flight replanning between dispatchers and ATC, because there is not an efficient mechanism for sharing information between national airspace (NAS) information sources and pilots. This reduces the pilot's ability to collaborate on strategic decisions during flight. Today pilots rely heavily on voice for information. This increases both pilot and controller workload, limits the scope of strategic options, and reduces overall system operational efficiency. FAA sponsored Aircraft Access to SWIM (AAtS) defines methods for extending the NAS information reach to the onboard pilot, by facilitating information exchange between SWIM-enabled NAS Services and aircraft systems. This allows more effective pilot-controller collaboration, enables more strategic inflight replanning, facilitates more efficient use of airspace, reduces harmful emissions, and adds a layer of resiliency for handling unplanned changes. FAA does not typically fund non-NAS components. A cost sharing economic business model with industry is envisioned where the FAA freely provides NAS information to consumers, and the consumers fund deployment to the airline and aircraft. AAtS proposes new system level architectures between the NAS SWIM and the pilot. In order for AAtS to become successful care must taken to ensure industry investments and business values align with FAA's. This paper describes the AAtS concepts to extend NAS information to aircraft, as well as the cost sharing business model, and emerging AAtS architectures defined to facilitate bi-directional, air-ground information exchange. It explains how this information exchange adds value to end system users and adds a layer of resiliency to the NAS operations to enhance overall system efficiency and safety by facilitating effective collaborative decision making (CDM) between flight operations risk managers. Lastly, it lays out key challenges associated with successfully bringing AAtS to fruition.},

abstract={This paper describes the design, implementation, and use of a data warehouse that supports air traffic management (ATM) research at NASA's Ames Research Center. The data warehouse, dubbed Sherlock, has been in development since 2009 and is a crucial piece of the ATM research infrastructure used by Ames and its partners. Sherlock comprises several components, including a database, a Web-based user interface, and supplementary services for query and visualization. The information stored includes raw data collected from the National Airspace System (NAS), parsed and processed data, derived data, and reports derived from pre-defined queries. The raw data include a variety of flight information from live streams of FAA operational systems, weather observations and forecasts, and NAS advisories and statistics. The modified data comprise parsed and merged data sources and metadata, enabling parameterized searches for data of interest. The derived data represent the results of research analyses deemed to be of significant interest to a wide cross-section of users. Sherlock is implemented on an Oracle 11g database, with supplemental services built on open-source packages and custom software. It contains over 20 TB of data spanning several years, and more data are added daily. It has supported several research studies, such as finding similar days in the NAS and predicting imposition of traffic flow management restrictions. Planned enhancements include integrated search across data sources and the capability for large-scale analytics.},

pages={2D1-1-2D1-11},
abstract={Loss of control (LOC) is the leading cause of general aviation (GA) accidents according to findings of the GA Joint Steering Committee (GAJSC). Main contributors to LOC are lack of awareness of the energy state and the angle-of attack, as well as margins from published limits of the aircraft. As part of their assessment, the GAJSC developed a GA Safety Plan and identified a list of safety enhancements (SEs). Several of these safety enhancements address the improvement of the pilot's energy state awareness (e.g. better awareness of the aircraft's angle-of-attack, and tools to help in achieving a stabilized approach and landing). This paper addresses a GA synthetic vision display concept that includes cues to help the pilots' awareness of the aircraft energy state during various phases of flight including arrival, approach and landing. First, the glide path along the extended centerline of the selected runway is visualized on the primary flight display (PFD). Upon visual acquisition of this path, the pilot can choose to have the system compute and display an intercept-tunnel from the current position to the glide path along the extended centerline, and can use a flight path (FPM) marker to assess the aircraft motion with respect to the lateral and vertical path constraints. To assess the deviation of the current energy state from the desired energy state, a potential flight path angle (PFPA) indicator is included. The PFPA is an acceleration cue (along the flight path), and is scaled such that it indicates a change of flight path at the current power setting while holding speed constant. In addition to the PFPA, the display includes the maximum and minimum PFPA to make the pilots aware of the safety margins when applying maximum thrust and idle thrust. Finally, the display will include an indication of pitch limits with respect to the critical stall-(vS0) and never-exceed-(vNE) velocities In addition to a detailed explanation of the GA SVS concept and the added energy awareness cues, the paper will discuss the preparation for a human-in-the loop evaluation and flight test of the proposed concepts.},

abstract={The differences in performance of various manufacturers' Flight Management Systems (FMSs) and their associated Flight Management Computers (FMCs) have the potential for significant impact on the air traffic control system and as such need to be examined and reexamined. While Performance Based Navigation (PBN) Area Navigation (RNAV) and Required Navigation Performance (RNP) procedures and routes are designed according to criteria contained in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) orders, FMC manufacturers build their systems in accordance with Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards (MASPS) and Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for area navigation systems, Technical Standard Orders (TSOs) and Advisory Circulars (ACs). It has been shown in previous papers on this subject that the resulting performance of the aircraft FMC will generally meet the procedure design requirements identified in the FAA criteria. However, there are notable differences. A goal of this paper is to provide supporting data for the development of instrument procedures and associated criteria where aircraft operations meet expectations for repeatability and predictability to levels of performance sufficient to support PBN worldwide and specifically in the National Airspace System (NAS) and the Next Generation (NextGen) environment. Sometimes, due to the nearly independent development of procedure design criteria and aircraft performance standards, the paths of various aircraft on the same procedure do not overlap and do not closely match the intent of the procedure designer. This paper is an addition to eight annual studies which began in 2006, (all presented at previous Digital Avionics System Conferences) with the basic title of Analysis of Advanced Flight Management Systems (FMSs), Field Observations Trials. The hypothesis of these papers has been that the FMSs produced by the major avionics manufacturers and installed in various airframe platforms will perform differently and each paper has attempted to quantify those differences. This paper studies Performance Based Navigation to x Landing System (PBN to xLS), where xLS includes instrument (ILS) or Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) landing systems (also referred to as GLS), or Space Based Augmentation System (SBAS) landing systems (also referred to as LPV) through analysis of data collected from a series of trials where FMS bench testing devices and high fidelity simulators fly an RNP to ILS approach at selected temperatures. The paper analyzes differences between aircraft models (with specific avionics equipage) and how they transition from Lateral Navigation/Vertical Navigation (LNAV/VNAV) to the ILS Localizer/Glideslope (LOC/GS) given temperature deviations. In addition, MITRE will investigate differences and relationships between what is expected by procedure design and charting and the conditions under which they can be successfully executed by the FMSs and autopilot. The results support the validation of a Matrix Laboratory (MATLAB) [1] tool which has been developed to study the characteristics of such approach designs relative to current aircraft/avionics that might be used to fly them over a range of design and environmental conditions. The approach chosen for this exercise is the RNP to ILS approach, PAKT ILS Z RWY 11, at Ketchikan, Alaska. There are also EUROCONTROL, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and FAA PBN to xLS projects all over the world and there are reported to be over 200 RNP to ILS approaches published in China, but they are all special procedures coded for specific airlines. For MITRE's purposes, a public procedure that is already coded in Jeppesen, Lufthansa Systems (LIDO) and European Aeronautical Group (EAG) aircraft navigation databases is required and to date, the PAKT procedure is the only public RNP to ILS approach identified by Jeppesen and LIDO. Controlled field observations trials were made using fourteen FMS avionics test benches at seven major FMC manufacturers, and five high fidelity flight simulators at three major airlines. The focus on the subject presented follows The MITRE Corporation's previous analysis of manufacturers' FMSs. The intent of this report is to contribute data, analysis, conclusions and recommendations to industry and the FAA that may influence criteria development to enhance RNAV and RNP operations and to help the FAA establish criteria for PBN to xLS. Some conclusions in this paper propose that a continuously descending path definition for these procedures would be problematic operationally. For high International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) deviations, captures necessarily will be from above, which is behavior that flight crews deem unsatisfactory. It also can cause the systems to capture the GS before the LOC, which is another undesirable consequence. It was further observed that some systems automatically insert a shallower vertical path segment prior to the expected GS capture point which allows for deceleration. Relative to temperature variation in the barometric path however, this segment allows even hot day GS captures to be from below the GS, widening the temperature range over which capture can occur. This was unexpected but a very positive finding. Complete conclusions and recommendations are presented at the end of this paper.},

abstract={Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) serves as a cornerstone for transforming the United States (US) National Airspace System (NAS) from a system that primarily relies on ground-based navigation and surveillance to a satellite-based system. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been leveraging PBN capabilities in the design of advanced arrival and departure procedures in terminal airspace surrounding major US airports. Implementations of PBN procedures have improved system efficiencies and provided operational benefits. Future progress in the design of terminal PBN procedures and further gains in operational efficiencies will increasingly rely on advancing applicable aircraft separation standards that safely capitalize on PBN-enabled improvements in navigation accuracy and precision. Safety assessments of such advances often rely in part on quantitative characterizations of actual navigation performance. The recent implementation and ongoing flight validations of Required Navigation Performance (RNP) and Area Navigation (RNAV) Visual Flight Procedures (RVFP) at The Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) now enable characterizations of actual navigation performance in terminal operations achieved along straight and curved segments of PBN procedures. This paper reviews key areas for advancing PBN-based terminal arrival and departure operations, describes the methodology developed to acquire and analyze surveillance data of RVFP operations, and presents quantitative characterizations of achieved navigation performance.},

abstract={Data-driven charts (DDC) are electronic information charts that are drawn from an onboard chart database onto the installed forward displays in an aircraft flight deck. A DDC management system is intended to display only the electronic chart data which is relevant to a mission or flight on the moving map or navigation display. We anticipate that the utility of such electronic information charts will increase as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) transitions to future operations such as performance based navigation in the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). We developed display recommendations for integrating instrument flight rule (IFR) procedural chart data into an avionics suite using a pilot-centered approach involving a variety of methods including analysis, prototyping, and simulator evaluation with pilots as participants. Display concepts were based on alternatives for declutter of chart elements and management of textual information (i.e., chart notes). In this way, we were able to explore human factors issues related to implementation of electronic information chart capabilities in forward displays on the flight deck. To support the FAA's Aircraft Certification and Flight Standards specialists who will evaluate new and modified flight deck avionics and their use for certification and operational approvals to enable NextGen capabilities, a number of recommendations addressing minimum requirements for flight deck implementation of such displays and their associated controls were produced. Specific recommendations address integration of chart elements, including intuitive display, quick access to the electronic fixed chart viewer with all notes and procedures, chart declutter, and allocation of chart data across displays. We anticipate that the recommended requirements for DDC systems will enable such systems to simplify flight deck display content and facilitate flightcrew access to the specific, relevant navigation and guidance information that is needed to monitor taxi and flight path conformance, and to plan for subsequent flight segments while also attending to other tasks on the flight deck. This display management technology could improve flightcrew performance and make flight and taxi operations in the NextGen environment more efficient without compromising safety.},

abstract={As new technologies are developed to handle the complexities of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), it is increasingly important to address both current and future safety concerns along with the operational, environmental, and efficiency issues within the National Airspace System (NAS). In recent years, the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) safety offices have been researching ways to utilize the many safety databases maintained by the FAA, such as those involving flight recorders, radar tracks, weather, and many other high-volume sensors, in order to monitor this unique and complex system. Although a number of current technologies do monitor the frequency of known safety risks in the NAS, very few methods currently exist that are capable of analyzing large data repositories with the purpose of discovering new and previously unmonitored safety risks. While monitoring the frequency of known events in the NAS enables mitigation of already identified problems, a more proactive approach of finding unidentified issues still needs to be addressed. This is especially important in the proactive identification of new, emergent safety issues that may result from the planned introduction of advanced NextGen air traffic management technologies and procedures. Development of an automated tool that continuously evaluates the NAS to discover both events exhibiting flight characteristics indicative of safety-related concerns as well as operational anomalies will heighten the awareness of such situations in the aviation community and serve to increase the overall safety of the NAS. This paper discusses the extension of previous anomaly detection work to identify operationally significant flights within the highly complex airspace encompassing the New York area of operations, focusing on the major airports of Newark International (EWR), LaGuardia International (LGA), and John F. Kennedy International (JFK). In addition, flight traffic in the vicinity of Denver International (DEN) airport/airspace is also investigated to evaluate the impact on operations due to variances in seasonal weather and airport elevation. From our previous research, subject matter experts determined that some of the identified anomalies were significant, but could not reach conclusive findings without additional supportive data. To advance this research further, causal examination using domain experts is continued along with the integration of air traffic control (ATC) voice data to shed much needed insight into resolving which flight characteristic(s) may be impacting an aircraft's unusual profile. Once a flight characteristic is identified, it could be included in a list of potential safety precursors. This paper also describes a process that has been developed and implemented to automatically identify and produce daily reports on flights of interest from the previous day.},

abstract={One of the goals of the Marginal Ice Zones Observations and Processes Experiment (MIZOPEX) NASA Earth science mission was to show the operational capabilities of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) when deployed on challenging missions, in difficult environments. Given the extreme conditions of the Arctic environment where MIZOPEX measurements were required, the mission opted to use a radar to provide a ground-based detect-and-avoid (GBDAA) capability as an alternate means of compliance (AMOC) with the see-and-avoid federal aviation regulation. This paper describes how GBDAA safety assurance was provided by interpreting and applying the guidelines in the national policy for UAS operational approval. In particular, we describe how we formulated the appropriate safety goals, defined the processes and procedures for system safety, identified and assembled the relevant safety verification evidence, and created an operational safety case in compliance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements. To the best of our knowledge, the safety case, which was ultimately approved by the FAA, is the first successful example of non-military UAS operations using GBDAA in the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS), and, therefore, the first nonmilitary application of the safety case concept in this context.},

abstract={There are a number of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) major automated systems and developmental programs that interoperate to support the day to day functional operations of the National Airspace System (NAS). The integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the NAS will require interaction with this automation. The purpose of this paper is to provide insight into the degree that these systems are prepared to accommodate those interactions. The rationale behind this assessment includes the ongoing discussions about FAA delays relative to accommodation of UAS operations, the need to understand the technical and operational impediments to seamless integration of UAS operations into the National Airspace System (NAS), and the compelling commercial arguments for UAS integration. The authors are supporting efforts to advance the development and evaluation UAS capabilities to facilitate operations within the NAS. These efforts encompass engineering and technical services attendant to examining, evaluating, and assessing various activities envisioning a broader picture of a future NAS in which UAS operations are unimpeded and occur with much greater frequency than today. Examining the relevant operational, technical, and procedural implications of increased UAS missions, in addition to exploring the potential impacts of accelerated UAS usage on NAS dynamics, are critically important efforts necessary so that all stakeholders can appreciate operational impacts. The paper addresses the results of research project to examine the existing NextGen portfolio vis-à-vis emerging UAS capabilities. The research study effort covers the relevant operational, technical, and procedural implications of increased UAS missions in the NAS. The key NAS platforms are reviewed and areas of significant effects on traditional air traffic control (ATC) paradigms and procedures, as well as on current automation and communications infrastructure are presented.},

abstract={The recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) testing will transform our daily lives. Because of the inherent flexibility, ease of use, and low cost to operate; UAV-based delivery systems will become tremendously popular in the near future. In this paper, we address the issue of cyber-physical scheduling of UAV resources in order to achieve an efficient delivery service. Particularly, to reduce the overall delivery time, we develop a weight-based scheduling scheme, which considers the priority and delivery distance of service requests. To maximize the probability of effectively handling service requests with a limited number of UAVs, we first formalize the problem as an optimization problem and then use a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. Through a simulation study, our data shows that the service delivery delay and the probability of successfully handling UAV services requests can be significantly improved upon in comparison with existing baseline schemes.},

abstract={Air Traffic Management (ATM) in the FAA's NEXTGEN as well as the European SESAR has embraced the concept of System Wide Information Management (SWIM) as the means to improve data exchange between various applications in different domains such as flight data management, weather and aeronautical information management. Enabling SWIM is a challenging change for ATM. Although many building blocks are already available, a full SWIM deployment has yet to emerge. Current SWIM functionality is based on historical grown technical restrictions. A performance-based and efficient approach will require new paradigms to organize the commonly shared information and develop and deploy the associated changes in the different user systems and applications as ATM services are developing towards a global and seamless airspace. The continuously increasing bandwidth in wide area networks has allowed new technologies to emerge such as Cloud Computing and Web based integrated user interfaces. The safety critical nature of ATM requires secure and timely sharing of information between separate platforms and diverse user groups. ATM data producers, consumers as well as the information elements themselves reside in multiple domains and will require seamless integration at the user interface level. This paper introduces a concept for Multiple Independent Layers of a Security (MILS) Console Subsystem (MCS) for a dependable information and communication infrastructure for ATM voice and data services. Safety and security requirements intrinsic to ATM networks present an ideal application for Distributed MILS architectures. This paper focuses on the console subsystem that manages the interactions between a human user and one or more separation kernel (SK) partitions. The MCS, itself, runs on a separation kernel. Its clients are partitions on the same SK nodes in an enclave that are capable of communicating with the MCS in a trustworthy fashion. The MCS communicates with its clients (client application back-end) via SK information channels (e.g. IP communication configured on a single node). The human interface provided by the MCS consists of input/output devices exemplified by a display screen, keyboard, mouse, microphone and speaker that can be shared among partitions for voice and data applications at the same time. MCS use cases are derived from Communication Services representing a unique class of communications equipment serving special purposes in safety-of-life-critical and security sensitive areas. Distributed MILS methodologies are used to achieve the required system availability. Distributed MILS (D-MILS) allows selected information elements to reside in all instantiated structures while completely prohibiting the propagation of faults from one side to the other and as such providing for a valid business continuity design. In the case of separated user domains the solution must not only ensure separation but also the integrity of voice and data streams on an end-to-end basis. Hardware virtualization techniques provide a new way of designing business continuity solutions for ATM solutions. They reduce cost and simplify system designs through the separation of data and information elements from the underlying hardware. The hardware degrades to a commodity exchangeable and replaceable in size, and scales separated from the hosted applications via an abstraction layer. Typical virtualization characteristics include partitioning, isolation, immediate multi-instantiation, and hardware independence. A discussion of the technical challenges arising from the use of an MCS based on a distributed MILS approach in a safety-critical environment concludes this contribution.},

abstract={The international aviation community has shared information since the first trans-oceanic flight occurred. As more aircraft made the voyage, more information was needed to ensure safe passage. Today, the data shared and the means for sharing that data is somewhat robust and adequately reliable. However, with the advent of new technologies and advances in data sharing concepts, the international community can leverage those advances to improve safety and service. The FAA has initiated a program called Mini Global, and has reached out to international ANSPs, Airlines, and industry to participate. This paper details the first milestone associated with Mini Global, the Risk Mitigation Demonstration (RMD). The RMD was structured to establish the initial Mini Global Enterprise, connect the FAA's Florida NextGen Test Bed, and establish connections with international ANSPs. Once connections were established, use cases were executed to demonstrate the international exchange of information based on established standards for flight, weather, and aeronautical information. Although issues were identified, the results of the RMD showed that the standards can meet global data exchange challenges. Since the RMD, the Mini Global team has expanded international participation, developed more robust data sharing, and added a European Enterprise Messaging Service. With the infrastructure in place, more international partners can be added, more complex use cases demonstrated, and more data can be captured and analyzed.},

abstract={When the air traffic demand is expected to exceed the available airport's capacity for a short period of time, Ground Stop (GS) operations are implemented by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Traffic Flow Management (TFM). The GS requires departing aircraft meeting specific criteria to remain on the ground to achieve reduced demands at the constrained destination airport until the end of the GS. This paper provides a high-level overview of the statistical distributions as well as causal factors for the GSs at the major airports in the United States. The GS's character, the weather impact on GSs, GS variations with delays, and the interaction between GSs and Ground Delay Programs (GDPs) at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) are investigated. The machine learning methods are used to generate classification models that map the historical airport weather forecast, schedule traffic, and other airport conditions to implemented GS/GDP operations and the models are evaluated using the cross-validations. This modeling approach produced promising results as it yielded an 85% overall classification accuracy to distinguish the implemented GS days from the normal days without GS and GDP operations and a 71% accuracy to differentiate the GS and GDP implemented days from the GDP only days.},

volume={},

pages={7A4-1-7A4-8},
abstract={As a proposed indicator of operational efficiency in the National Airspace System (NAS), a new Departure Flow Efficiency (DFE) metric has been formulated. For a major metropolitan airport, the DFE considers flight times from departure to a 175 nautical mile (NM) radius from the airport, with population stratification by aircraft performance, departure runway, and azimuth of a flight's radius crossing (i.e., the measure of the angle, from zero to 360 degrees, formed from the Airport Reference Point1to the point of radius crossing). As more flights follow efficient lateral and vertical profiles, the average daily DFE metric value goes up. For a given day, a high DFE metric value implies that many flights were expedited, indicating efficient departure operations. An “exception report” is needed to identify operating conditions that may result in an inefficient departure when a low DFE metric value is computed. The intent is to test for a correlation with meteorological or other conditions. Three cases are examined: (1) flights exhibiting a nominal speed, but traversing an extended distance, (2) flights traversing a nominal distance, but exhibiting a slow speed, and (3) impeded short-hop flights. Case 1 may be caused by flight deviations around severe weather areas. Case 2 may be caused by a conventional climb profile against a strong headwind or an altitude profile with an extended period of low altitude flying to stay under severe weather. Case 3 may be caused by arrival constraints at the destination airport. Analysis to discern these three cases involves the use of flight track data, as well as Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) winds data and National Convective Weather Diagnostic (NCWD) data. In addition, an algorithm for the detection of holding patterns and delay vectors in archived operational data was employed for Case 3.},

title={Coordination between sectors in shared airspace operations},

pages={7C3-1-7C3-12},
abstract={Recent studies have shown that a more efficient use of airspace may involve shared airspace operations, i.e., temporal as well as spatial separation of arrival and departure flows [1, 2]. Temporal separation would permit a departure aircraft to fly through an arrival flow, depending on an available gap. This would necessitate careful and precise coordination between controllers in different sectors. Three methods of coordination which permit the penetration of a controller's airspace by another controller's aircraft are described: point-out, look-and-go, and prearranged coordination procedure. Requirements of each method are given, along with associated problems that have surfaced in the field as described by Aviation Safety and Reporting System (ASRS) and other reports. A Human-in-the-Loop simulation was designed to compare two of the methods: point-out and prearranged coordination procedures. In prearranged coordination procedures (P-ACP), the controllers control an aircraft in another controller's airspace according to specified prearranged procedures, without coordinating each individual aircraft with another controller, as is done with point-outs. In the simulation, three experienced controllers rotated through two arrival sectors and a non-involved arrival sector of a Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) airspace. Results of eighteen one-hour simulation runs (nine in each of the two conditions) showed no impact of the coordination method on separation violations nor on arrival times for 208 departing aircraft crossing an arrival stream. Participant assessment indicated that although both coordination conditions were acceptable, the prearranged coordination procedure condition was slightly safer, more efficient, timely, and overall, worked better operationally. Problems arose in the point-out condition regarding controllers noticing acceptance of point-outs. Also, in about half of the point-out U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright runs, time pressure was felt to have had an impact on when and if the departures could cross an arrival stream. An additional problem with point-outs may be confusion in the field about which controller has responsibility for separating point-out aircraft from other aircraft.},

volume={},

pages={7C5-1-7C5-11},
abstract={Maintaining safe and efficient operations at airports while the National Airspace System grows and evolves requires understanding of potential hazards and the conditions that lead from these potential hazards to actual incidents and accidents. Such understanding is necessary to model the risks expected under future operational conditions, to develop mitigation strategies for anticipated risks, and to predict the effectiveness of the mitigation under a range of conditions. An essential step is to develop and validate predictive, quantitative models to characterize the relationships between causal factors and collision risk. Predictive models relate risk to factors such as traffic levels and airport properties, and support risk mitigation planning for the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) initiative. Faced with an absence of credible models for collision risk in airport surface movement, we developed methods for counting aircraft interactions and estimating parameters relevant to collision potential in previous work sponsored by the FAA's Office of Aviation Safety (AVS) [1]. In the current work, we describe our progress in developing quantitative, predictive models of risk as a function of airport conditions, based on the previous work. A key element is defining criteria for identifying a subset of aircraft interactions in the airport movement area as Potentially Hazardous Interactions (PHI), as described in other recent work [2]. Our research focuses on three main topics: how to predict rates of more serious but rarer incidents from the more readily-observed precursor events; finding the factors that are most strongly linked to changes in these rates; and systematically describing how the rates of PHIs vary between airports. These results are the first step toward predictive models that could help to guide strategies for technology development or procedural changes to mitigate these risks. We present results of applying these analysis methods to sample data based on surveillance data measured at multiple U.S. airports. These results constitute a basis for inferring the effectiveness of different operational improvements ranging from airport surface management practices to enhanced aircraft equipage benefits in limiting the rate of potentially hazardous operations under anticipated future airport traffic levels.},

abstract={Aeronautical Information Services (AIS) and Meteorological (MET) Data Link Services are being developed by the aviation community. Standardization activities are taking place in RTCA Special Committee (SC) 206. This paper describes a satellite communication (SATCOM) data link model developed and used to analyze a use case in which en route aircraft receive AIS and MET data. This modeling and analysis effort was performed to support the development of an analysis process to evaluate potential delivery methods for AIS/MET data link services. The analyzed use case describes envisioned future flight operations encountering convective weather activity while en route. It identifies a scenario in which AIS/MET data link services are established by all aircraft participating in the use case. These aircraft receive MET and AIS updates from the ground while traversing the defined use case volume. The updates will provide improved situational awareness for the flight crew. This paper discusses the use case and identifies the technical characteristics of the transmitted AIS/MET messages. It also describes the message time sequence diagram developed for the use case and implemented in the simulation model. The generic SATCOM model developed to analyze this use case is then presented. The model components, assumptions, and parameters are identified. Simulation results obtained for the AIS/MET use case are presented. Results have been obtained for each of the performance metrics identified as part of the SC-206 architecture characterization activities. They include 95th percentile latency values for each AIS/MET message type, throughput, and utilization as a percentage of data link capacity.},

A mathematical model of forward-looking alerting is introduced, which is used to Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) in order to overcome the above limitation. That is a broader term `terrain awareness and warning system' (TAWS).

abstract={Civilian Airborne Networks capable of providing network connectivity to users onboard aircraft and users on the ground may soon be viable. We propose a novel airborne network architecture consisting of commercial aircraft and ground station gateways inter-connected with Free-Space Optical Communications (FSOC) links to form a high-bandwidth mesh network. The use of directional FSOC links necessitates explicit topology control, where a protocol must manage which links will point at one another to form connections. The algorithm used by the topology control protocol to form topologies must have low computation time, and must compute topologies that are robust, inclusive, and contain short paths between nodes. We use FAA flight path data for the aircraft en route within the continental United States during a 24-hour period to analyze the properties of airborne mesh networks, and compare candidate topology algorithms. In our simulation an airborne network with ground stations was able to continuously connect over 98% of the air-craft into a mesh network using FSOC links. We propose two new topology algorithms (DCTRT and DCKruskal+Long) which are extensions to existing algorithms. DCKruskal+Long appears to perform best for the metrics measured.},

abstract={For a marine gas turbine generation set, the speed of power turbine must keep constant. Due to the varying load demand, the real and reactive power balance is damaged and thus the speed of power turbine becomes deviated from nominal value.

The design of an adptive fuzzy PID controller fit for this marine gas turbine generation set were achieved. The simulating experiments were performed at different load conditions to test the effectiveness of the proposed method. Simulation results have shown the improved control performance. The proposed method overcomes the drawbacks of the traditional PID controller and improvement was achieved for the aspects of settling time, oscillations and overshoot.},

title={Assessing Knowledge Retention of an Immersive Serious Game vs. a Traditional Education Method in Aviation Safety},
year={2015},
volume={21},
number={4},
pages={529-538},
abstract={Thanks to the increasing availability of consumer head-mounted displays, educational applications of immersive VR could now reach to the general public, especially if they include gaming elements (immersive serious games). Safety education of citizens could be a particularly promising domain for immersive serious games, because people tend not to pay attention to and benefit from current safety materials. In this paper, we propose an HMD-based immersive game for educating passengers about aviation safety that allows players to experience a serious aircraft emergency with the goal of surviving it. We compare the proposed approach to a traditional aviation safety education method (the safety card) used by airlines. Unlike most studies of VR for safety knowledge acquisition, we do not focus only on assessing learning immediately after the experience but we extend our attention to knowledge retention over a longer time span. This is a fundamental requirement, because people need to retain safety procedures in order to apply them when faced with danger. A knowledge test administered before, immediately after and one week after the experimental condition showed that the immersive serious game was superior to the safety card. Moreover, subjective as well as physiological measurements employed in the study showed that the immersive serious game was more engaging and fear-arousing than the safety card, a factor that can contribute to explain the obtained superior retention, as we discuss in the paper.},

abstract={Simulation models are often employed to evaluate projected future performance of the US National Airspace System (NAS) for the purposes of long-term aviation investment planning and performance benchmarking. The future schedules are developed as input for simulation to represent the forecast for airport operations. The itinerary structure of a future schedule has a significant impact on the operational characteristics such as schedule peaks and aircraft utilization. Itinerary generation algorithms seeking to maximize the aircraft utilization may cause schedule smoothing or de-peaking which is undesirable for airlines wishing to maintain their schedule peaks. In addition, itineraries with high aircraft utilization are likely to have more propagated delay. To achieve a certain level of balance between aircraft utilization and a desired level of schedule peaks and delay performance is a complex task for the itinerary generation process especially when the entire NAS is involved. This paper proposes a new method for creating future itineraries based on a hybrid solution of simulation and optimization techniques. The Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) technique is used to solve the itinerary generation problem with the objective to maximize the aircraft utilization of the itinerary structure of the flights. The simulation technique is used to evaluate the performance of the NAS in terms of delay with the generated itineraries from the MIP solution. Based on the output of the simulation, the MIP model will be modified by adjusting its parameters and solved again. This iterative process will continue until the desired result is obtained from the simulation. This paper also provides a quantitative analysis to demonstrate a trade-off between the de-peaking strategies that minimize the number of aircraft in service and the banking strategies that maintain schedule banks.},

abstract={Audio-video synchronization is a very common quality issue that has a direct effect on the end-user's experience. Audio and video streams are supposed to be synchronized at the transmitter. However, they might be received out of synchronization. In general, loss of synchronization between audio and video streams may be attributed to several factors such as incorrect time-stamping at the transmitter, frame loss, and the different delays introduced by the signal processing and post-processing functions on each stream. Unfortunately, the video pipeline is much complicated as compared with the audio pipeline. Hence, during the journey of the streams from the transmitter to the presentation unit at the receiver, they may be susceptible to different processing delays. These different delays can make the two streams finally presented out of phase. Different algorithms were developed for preserving synchronization at the receiver side in order to provide the best possible perceptual quality. However, most of these algorithms rely on the encoded data of the bit streams. Hence, this paper introduces a new audio-video synchronization algorithm that exploits some features in MPEG-2 system layer. It addresses the misalignment of audio and video streams occurred due to the different processing and post-processing delays. The proposed algorithm relies on both the system clock reference and the relative alignment between the audio and video streams.},

abstract={An intelligent controller based on the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang-type probabilistic fuzzy neural network with an asymmetric membership function (TSKPFNN-AMF) is developed in this paper for the reactive and active power control of a three-phase grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system during grid faults. The inverter of the three-phase grid-connected PV system should provide a proper ratio of reactive power to meet the low-voltage ride through (LVRT) regulations and control the output current without exceeding the maximum current limit simultaneously during grid faults. Therefore, the proposed intelligent controller regulates the value of reactive power to a new reference value, which complies with the regulations of LVRT under grid faults. Moreover, a dual-mode operation control method of the converter and inverter of the three-phase grid-connected PV system is designed to eliminate the fluctuation of dc-link bus voltage under grid faults. Furthermore, the network structure, the online learning algorithm, and the convergence analysis of the TSKPFNN-AMF are described in detail. Finally, some experimental results are illustrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed control for the three-phase grid-connected PV system.},

abstract={A recurrent fuzzy neural cerebellar model articulation network (RFNCMAN) control is proposed in this paper for position servo drive systems to track various periodical position references with robustness. The adopted position servo drive system is designed using a six-phase PMSM and equipped with a fault-tolerant control scheme. First, an ideal computed torque controller is designed for the tracking of the rotor position reference command. Since the uncertainties of the PMSM position servo drive system are difficult to know in advance, it is impossible to design an ideal computed control law for practical applications. Therefore, the RFNCMAN is proposed to mimic the ideal computed torque controller with a compensated controller to compensate the approximation error. In the RFNCMAN, a recurrent fuzzy cerebellar model articulation network (RFCMAN) is adopted in the first dimension to enhance the online learning rate and localisation learning capability. Moreover, a general recurrent fuzzy neural network (RFNN) is adopted in the second dimension to enhance the generalisation performance and to reduce the required memory and rule numbers. Finally, the proposed position control system is implemented in a 32-bit floating-point DSP. The effectiveness of the proposed RFNCMAN control system is verified by some experimental results.},

pages={47-48},
abstract={This book presents the first unified and thorough discussion of Type-2 FLCs and Type-2 fuzzy logic control systems, providing the necessary tools for the design of the control of complex nonlinear systems. The analysis includes 1) the mathematical structure of some Type-2 FLCs, 2) stability of Type-2 fuzzy logic control systems, and 3) robustness of the Type-2 fuzzy logic control systems. This book, the first one entirely on Type-2 FLCs, shows the reader how to design Type-2 fuzzy logic control systems based on a variety of choices for the Type-2 FLC components and also demonstrates how to apply Type-2 fuzzy logic control theory to applications. It is written by five of the leading experts on Type-2 fuzzy sets, systems, and control. This book consists of seven chapters. This book has been written with an educational focus rather than a pure research focus. Each chapter includes worked examples, and most refer to computer programs accessible through the book’s Web site, outlining how to use them at a high level. Therefore, this book is appropriate for classroom use in graduate courses in electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science. This book also is a self-contained reference suitable for engineers, researchers, and graduate students who want to gain deep insights about Type-2 FLCs. },

abstract={Delineation of brain neoplasms are tedious if they exhibit homogenous pixel intensities with adjacent morphologies. Glioblastoma Multiforme is a highly infiltrating neoplasm which is proliferative, undifferentiated and non-enhancing. Neither CT nor MRI offers adequate image quality so as to identify the extent of GBM infiltration into perifocal edema. This article discusses the delineation of non-enhancing, undifferentiated, and highly infiltrating proliferative glioblastoma and perifocal edema from proven preoperative TI contrast MR images and estimation of per slice clinical as well as planning target volumes. Segmentation of GBM focus from edema was accomplished by K-Means clustering. Preprocessing include background elimination, restoration with bilateral filtering, enhancement with histogram equalization, and skull stripping. Pre-processing and segmentation tasks were performed in MATLAB®. Validation of the segmentation results, with manual segmentation as ground truth exhibited promising Dice similarity Index with mean of DSI 0.8017 ±0.0385 standard deviation.},

year={2015},

pages={83-91},
abstract={Civil engineering projects increasingly involve a wide range of stakeholders with diverse interests and multidisciplinary teams. Engineers need soft skills to deal with these teams and stakeholders. “How to educate these soft skills to engineering students?” is the central question for technical universities. The course Collaborative Design and Engineering in the Dutch master's programme Construction Management and Engineering is an answer to that question. Feedback, however, indicated that the course did not meet expectations. The course needed a radical redesign. This paper describes the redesign and resulting framework of the course. The principles of the redesign are constructive alignment, activated learning and not to lecture the skills as `dry stuff'. The resulting course is based on a `pressure cooker - coaching' framework. The pressure cooker part creates a situation in which the students will experience stress. The students work in large groups on a complex assignment under time pressure. A mix of group and individual assignments creates tension between students. The coaching part provides structure and guidance. Theory on the necessary soft skills is introduced early in the course in workshops. Consultation meetings help to keep the students on track. The course has now evolved over three years. Theoretical evaluation shows that the `pressure cooker - coaching' framework fulfills the requirements of constructive alignment. Practical evaluation, using feedback, shows a consistent high score. We consider the `pressure cooker - coaching' framework broadly applicable and is successful enough to continue in our CDE course. Elements of the course can be improved. We consider introducing more theoretical depth and psychology without violating our idea of `no dry stuff' and `action learning'.},

The utilization of information, communication, network and satellite technologies has made the aviation transportation as a rapid-globalization action. The civil aviation informatization has become the obstacle of aviation development. Hence, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has proposed the concept of SWIM. Base on this proposal, FAA and Euro control have developed their current condition oriented studies.

The System Wide Information Management (SWIM) concept is to change the conventional ATM information architecture from point-to-point data exchanges to system-wide interoperability. In this paper, the concept, architecture and design technologies of a real-time oriented multi-layer SWIM system architecture for service assurance are discussed. Moreover, to promote the development of SWIM, the project of Mini Global demonstration has been conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to exchange air transportation information among different Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) by using standardized information exchange models.

Each service is a self-contained information system by itself. Each of these services is custom designed, developed, managed, and maintained individually and locally at a significant cost [1]. System-Wide Information Management (SWIM) is a concept for modern ATM systems that present a complete change in paradigm of how ATM related information is handled and shared while services interoperate. The aim of SWIM is to provide information to users with understandable information. However, such a large amount of information that flow through a network may affect overall system performance. Quality of Service (QoS) describes network performance parameters reflect the quality of the connection and is experienced on end-to-end traffic flow. In this paper, we propose a model base on SWIM with implementation of Quality of Service configuration and application of network virtualization technique to separate network traffic into individual services, which intent to improve the quality of end-to-end network traffic. This network model is developed and deployed using Juniper MX series router.},

Second approach is using some special “robotic” types of clouds, such as Robot-as-a-Service and Function-as-a-Service to leverage abilities of a single robotics platform in mobile robotic system as services to robotic system's users or other mobile robotic platforms.

The SEI (Software Engineering Institute) created the CMMI-DEV (Capability Maturity Model Integration for Development) as a model for organizations to improve their processes and to be appraised in many levels. However, CMMI DEV is not recognized as a mean of compliance for airborne embedded software, unlike the norm DO-178C, from RTCA (Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics), which is recognized by Federal Aviation Administration by the Advisory Circular 20 115C.

abstract={Predicting an aircraft's Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) while enroute can be a challenging endeavor. The great number of factors that can affect a flight's punctuality range from things well under the pilot's control, such as flight level and cruise airspeed, all the way to environmental circumstances that are generally very hard to predict, such as weather phenomena and airport congestion. Therefore, aircraft ETA predictions tend to rely heavily on aircraft performance models, along with either parametric or physics-based trajectory models, being only sometimes enhanced by simplistic statistical considerations, such as the average winds encountered in a flight path during a certain period of the year. This work presents a method for enhancing aircraft ETA predictions by applying machine learning techniques, taking into account general information about the flight as well as weather and air traffic. A good amount of effort is put into feature generation and selection, and subsequently a model is built from representative flight, weather and air traffic data, allowing for an increase in prediction accuracy. Some of the challenges that arise from the nature of the data are discussed, such as the fact that weather information is naturally fragmented into a great number of variables, which makes it difficult to extract value from it without a very large number of samples covering all possible scenarios. The results show that it is possible to enhance the ETA predictions obtained from traditional methods by correcting them with a model that takes into account the statistical relationships observed between flight, air traffic and weather information.},

abstract={The Chesapeake Bay currently suffers pollution due to excess nitrogen and phosphorus coming from agricultural runoff. To reduce agricultural runoff, systems must be introduced to monitor nutrient levels on farmland and incentivize farmers to adopt best management practices (BMPs). This project uses the upper Chesapeake Bay in Maryland as a case study. Results indicate that an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a multispectral imagery subsystem would offer the greatest balance of cost and utility for monitoring farmland. However, because commercial-use of UAVs are not currently illegal, a manned aircraft is recommended to test the proof of concept. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is moving toward allowing commercial UAV-use for agricultural applications. If the proof of concept is successful, it is recommended to move to a UAV platform for sustained operations once UAV laws are established. To encourage increased utilization of BMPs, a classification system is proposed in which farmers have access to incentive options based on the nutrient concentration on their farm. By measuring progress with a monitoring system and tying that in with an incentive system, environmental organizations can track progress in cleaning up our waters while rewarding actors contributing to that cause.},

abstract={Equipment on airliners must be certified by the FAA to ensure compliance with safety standards that are designed to minimize design-related flight crew errors. This process is currently accomplished by both Inspection and Human-In-The-Loop (HitL) testing - a time-consuming and costly process. A recent Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 25.1302 newly requires the analysis of all tasks increasing certification costs beyond current staffing, budget and timelines. The Procedure Analysis Tool (PAT) described in this paper is a decision support tool designed for use by inspectors performing the certification test to meet the FAR25.1302 requirements. The PAT simulates the performance of human operators performing a task on the device under evaluation and may be used as a screening tool to identify tasks that warrant HitL testing, allowing for evaluation within reasonable time and budget. The PAT calculates the percentage of pilots that perform the procedure in excess of an allowed threshold representing the Probability of Failure to Complete PFtoC the procedure. Procedures with long right tails are flagged for full HitL testing. PAT was demonstrated on 15 Swiss European airlines Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to evaluate the Multifunction Control Display Unit (MCDU). Three procedures resulted in a PFtoC above the threshold, and were therefore flagged for HitL testing. This preliminary analysis highlights the importance of semantic cues when recognizing the emerging mission situations which has the greatest effect on the final time distribution. Entering the 15 procedures into the tool took 5.1 hours and 11.56 seconds average runtime. Analysis of the human factors certification process shows that the PAT reduces the evaluation time by 70% per function.},

Currently, no system exists to automate the process of recording specific inflight aircraft measurements, parameterizing the aircraft, and creating the necessary documentation required by the FAA. This project proposes a low-cost flight data recording and analysis system that uses a combination of hardware and software for experimental amateur built (E-AB) aircraft pilots to use during the first 40 hours of their testing process that will help reduce error and inconsistencies. Final simulation data will be used to influence the ultimate device requirements for both the microcontroller platform, and inertial and positional sensors.},

abstract={As the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) prepares to integrate Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS), developing technologies that mitigate the risk associated with UAS collisions have become a top priority. Despite advances in detect and avoid technologies, the UAS operator remains the primary controller responsible for maintaining inter-vehicle separation and ensuring conflicts do not occur. This paper examines a collision awareness system which increases the operator's situational awareness by spatially and temporally predicting conflicts between the UAS and entities such as other aviation traffic or restricted airspaces. By modeling entities as 3D point masses, the system can be implemented for various, dissimilar UASs. Furthermore, the system supports aircraft engaged in different flight modes such as free flight, following a flight path, and orbit/loiter behavior. Mixed Gaussian distributions model each entity's future position, where the mean is determined by 3D kinematic motion and the covariance is determined by a continuous time error propagation model. Convolving these mixed distribution with another entity or airspace yields mathematically conservative future conflict estimates. Scenarios are presented to demonstrate the algorithm's capabilities.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of Aircraft Systems Information Security Protection (ASISP) from an FAA AVS perspective. Increased aircraft connectivity to aircraft systems and networks to Air Traffic Service (ATS) providers, including NextGen and public networks (e.g, Internet), may require additional security risk considerations. When the aircraft connects electronically to the infrastructure the safety, performance and interoperability requirements of both the aircraft and the systems that the aircraft are connected to should be considered. The FAA solution set includes safety, security, and environment. Improving safety, security, and the environment is an inherent part of the FAAs overall mission and is embedded in the activities of individual programs agency-wide. This solution set involves activities directly related to ensuring that NextGen systems contribute to steadily reducing risks to safety and information security while mitigating adverse effects on the environment and ensuring environmental protection that allows sustained aviation growth. Security issues related to individuals that could gain physical access to aircraft to cause malicious damage to the aircraft systems (e.g., improper maintenance procedures, cutting wire bundles, etc.) are not addressed in this paper. Physical aircraft security is enforced by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Transportation and Security Administration (TSA) . This paper is not a FAA official document and is the opinion of the author only. The pictures and figures contained in this paper were obtained from various internet sites, including the FAA NextGen program office.

abstract={The FAA is heavily dependent upon Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)-based services provided by telecommunications carriers (e.g. AT&T, CenturyLink) to support National Airspace System (NAS) requirements. These TDM-based services are used to transport voice and data to approximately 4000 physical locations across the contiguous United States. Current trends indicate that network growth will be driven by factors such as capacity and mobility and consequently service providers are moving to unify their service offerings for multiple data sources (voice, video, and data) onto a single network with the Internet Protocol (IP) being the underlying protocol of choice. In this paper, we present the technological background of TDM and provide the rationale for the service providers' move to an all-IP network. Having looked at the trends expected in the near to mid-term future, we describe the usage patterns of TDM-based services in the FAA and identify key FAA programs that can enable the transition of up to 87% of the TDM-based services to IP. The need to migrate from TDM to IP will require the FAA to develop a strategic vision. In this paper, we present a three-point approach for such a vision that leverages the key IP-enabler programs and recommends appropriate guidance be provided to these programs to allow for a successful migration in the near- to mid-term future.},

abstract={The first building block of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) initiative to modernize the US national airspace system (NAS) was the implementation of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) ground infrastructure. A primary aspect of the ADS-B program design is the terrestrial radio station infrastructure. It determined the terrestrial radio stations layout throughout the US and was optimized to meet system performance, safety and security in the NAS. In March 2014, the FAA completed the nationwide infrastructure upgrade, enabling air traffic controllers to track aircraft with greater accuracy and reliability, while giving pilots more information in the cockpit. More than 650 ADS-B radios communicate with equipped aircraft, supporting the new satellite-based surveillance system. Currently, the ADS-B system ingests processes and stores large data sets, while operating at ten percent capacity. As aircraft avionics equipage increases, the volume of data and storage needs will increase beyond our existing system's capacity and processing capability. A new, Hadoop-based architecture was tested to ingest and analyze billions of CAT033 reports in minutes. This paper presents the “Big Data” approach that was adopted to support fast analytics of large ADS-B data volume.},

abstract={The Dynamic Weather Routes (DWR) tool continuously and automatically analyzes airborne flights in en route airspace to identify flights where a route correction could save significant flight time and still avoid weather. A partnership between NASA, American Airlines (AA), and the FAA has enabled testing of DWR in real-world air traffic operations. En route Data Communications (Data Comm) could significantly reduce the controller and pilot workload needed to communicate DWR route changes under today's voice-based operations and thereby enable more timely and frequent high-value corrections to weather avoidance routes. Sample data from the DWR trial at AA illustrate how Data Comm could improve DWR operations. Two operating concepts that integrate DWR with Data Comm are described: (1) route corrections are initiated by air traffic control and implemented using Airborne Reroutes and Data Comm, and (2) route corrections are initiated by the dispatcher and pilot and implemented via Data Comm. Both concepts align with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) plans for implementation of Data Comm in en route airspace.},

abstract={4-D (3-dimensional position plus time) trajectory is an essential building block for both FAA's Next Generation Air Transportation Modernization (NextGen) program and the European Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) program. Under this 4-D trajectory concept, Flight Management Systems (FMSs) not only need to predict the 4-D trajectory of the aircraft but also to coordinate with the flight control system to track the planned 4-D trajectory within required positioning and timing thresholds. This 4-D trajectory architecture requires the FMS to ensure the aircraft arrive at a metering waypoint within 6 seconds or 30 seconds of its Required Time of Arrival (RTA), for waypoints on descent or in cruise, respectively. Most FMSs currently in production can comply with the RTA accuracy of 30 seconds at the 95% probability. However, most FMSs encounter significant difficulty in complying with the RTA accuracy of 6 seconds at the 95% probability for metering waypoints on descent due to technical challenges, such as much tighter timing threshold requirements, the true airspeed is continuously changing during descent, wind velocity varies over altitude, and standard descent speed profiles should be used. This paper presents a time control design that enables the FMS to not only comply with the RTA accuracy of 6 seconds but also execute a fuel-efficient 4-D trajectory. The proposed time control design is also cost-effective since it does not require any changes in existing auto pilot/auto-throttle systems. The Optimized Profile Descent (OPD) procedures are used in this paper to illustrate the performance of the proposed time control design. However, the applications of the proposed time control design are not limited to the Optimized Profile Descent flight procedure.},

abstract={In 2014, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) prioritized Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) capabilities of its Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) and committed to implementing high-priority innovations within the next three years. For 2015, the commitments include the issuance of a national standard for PBN-enabled Equivalent Lateral Spacing Operation (ELSO) departures and ELSO implementations at airports throughout the United States (US) National Airspace System (NAS). Beginning in 2011, flight validations of ELSO-based reduced-divergence procedures at The Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (KATL) demonstrated operational benefits and validated the ELSO concept for the development of the standard. The standard will enable the NAS-wide use of PBN departure procedures with a reduced minimum divergence of 10 degrees instead of the 15 degrees currently required to conduct simultaneous parallel and successive departure operations. This paper describes the process, from inception to integration into the NAS that pioneered the first PBN-enabled reduced separation standard for departures. Further work to identify candidate airports for application and activities supporting the harmonization of PBN-based separation standards in the global air transportation system are also discussed.},

abstract={This paper describes various approaches to secure interagency information sharing. The common objective of these approaches is to use federated credentialing as the basis for controlled access to federated, multi-agency information. The exemplary scenario for federated information sharing consists of FAA flight information being shared with authorized persons or organizations within a partner agency, such as the Department of Defense (DoD) and the converse. Approaches we explored involve an identity provider (IdP) entity that authenticates a user/client and provides a security token for consumption by a service provider (SP) entity accessed by the client. Since the emulated agencies maintain distinct security domains, secure information-sharing approaches involve varying combinations of IdP and SP entities spanning the emulated interagency boundary.},

pages={Q4-1-Q4-10},
abstract={The NextGen National Airspace System (NAS) has begun to take shape with the functional emergence of En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) and the Terminal Automation Modernization and Replacement (TAMR). NextGen Programs include: 1) Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B); 2) Collaborative Air Traffic Management Technologies (CATMT); 3) National Airspace System Voice System (NVS); 4) NextGen Weather; 5) Data Communications (Data Comm); and 6) System Wide Information Management (SWIM). These programs are being implemented to transform the operational precepts of the NAS, as based currently on ground control of aircraft separation. The NextGen programs will fundamentally change the NAS operational framework from a voice-centric to a data-centric model. The new model will rely extensively on air-ground operational integration coupled with ready-access to communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) data to enable 4-dimensional trajectory-based-operation (4DT) flow management. In addition to these advanced-development NextGen programs, the FAA has sponsored a pathfinder initiative to enable flightcrew access to SWIM data for enhanced shared situational awareness, (SSA). This pathfinder, known as Aircraft Access to SWIM (AAtS), has organized itself within a broad framework of public/private collaboration (government & industry partnership) focused on the coupled evolution of air-ground-integration and related enabling technologies. As a pathfinder, the AAtS operational paradigm is consistent with the U.S. vision for SWIM. The U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright solution developed focus on connecting SWIM to aircraft. Other air-service regions are considering different concepts, architectures and requirements for SWIM-aircraft connectivity and are targeted for later dates for entry into service. The AAtS initiative has developed: · an operations concept; · technical implementation framework; and · conducted operational demonstrations. These establish a proof-of-concept benchmark for implementation of a collaborative decision making (CDM) capability. The AAtS pathfinder environment leverages existing systems and new communications infrastructure, including broadband IP and COTS technology (see Figure 1). Demonstration data promoted better understanding of: 1) usage patterns for available products; 2) system-level performance; 3) utility of the demonstrated data links; 4) data protocol efficiency; 5) communication issue mitigation; and 6) potential performance improvements through lessons learned. Phase 2 will demonstrate air-to-ground communications in addition to the ground-to-air exchange from Phase 1. The Phase 2 demonstrations will measure operational systems performance, with an eye toward how best to facilitate CDM among the ATC, flightcrews, and the aircraft operations center (AOC). Data from resulting operational improvements will illustrate system efficiencies to be harvested through CDM. Air-ground integration within the realm of 4DT data exchange schema promises to yield material system efficiencies, especially as they apply to route optimization and accommodation of transient disruptions, e.g. traffic or weather induced flow upsets. The AAtS initiative will shed light on the nature of the expected efficiencies in addition to issues pertaining to system-safety and information security. AAtS, as a pathfinder, is well underway and has spurred significant future-systems architectural development within individual avionics original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in addition to collaborative development OEM teams. The future of AAtS is to build on a premise that SWIM services can produce a benefit for the operators and FAA thru CATM. As a result, CATM via AAtS will enable improved airspace usage as part of a broader connected aircraft strategy. The belief is that air traffic management and connected aircraft will benefit from increased situational awareness, combined with their ability to expeditiously formulate operational solutions working with controllers and company dispatchers. To become viable from a business perspective, AAtS must yield material benefit through cost avoidance in the air and during ground operations.},

volume={},

pages={S1-1-S1-14},
abstract={The paper addresses initial experience and lessons learned with the implementation of the Category I (CAT I) GBAS in the US National Airspace (NAS) and internationally. The paper will review the GBAS system architecture including Boeing and Airbus integration and airline equipage. Next the paper will address institutional, operational and technical experiences encountered in the installation and operation of GBAS. GBAS is included in the FAA's NextGen Implementation Plan and part of International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) Aviation System Block Upgrade Program. Aircraft Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) s such as Boeing and Airbus are currently delivering aircraft with GBAS Landing System (GLS) capability. CATI I GBAS facilities are operational or underway globally (Germany, Australia, Spain, Switzerland, Brazil, India, Russia) and as non-Federal systems in the US. A GBAS CAT I design, the Honeywell SLS-4000 was approved by the FAA in September 2009 as a non Fed system for use within the NAS. Category I (CAT I) GBAS has been operational for public use at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) since September 2012, and at George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston, Texas since April 2013. They are owned and operated by the respective airport authorities. United Airlines and Delta Airlines achieved FAA approval to fly GLS approaches. In 2014 United Airlines reached the milestone of 1000 GLS approaches since their operational approval. An increasing number of international carriers are also taking advantage of the GLS capability at Newark and Houston (e.g. British Airways, Emirates, and Lufthansa). The main body of the paper includes three sections each dedicated to addressing specific challenges, lessons learned for GBAS implementation - namely the institutional, operational, and technical challenges. The FAA chose not to install CAT-I GBAS as a federal system but did approve the system for use in the NAS. Public and private non-Fed systems installed in the NAS require FAA inspection and monitoring. The challenge with GBAS is that no federal GBAS systems exist in the NAS, but FAA must have appropriately trained personnel, procedures, and equipment to perform the required functions. GPS/GBAS performance monitoring and service prediction capability had to be addressed when implementing GBAS. Operational aspects will address airline approval process, pilot training, airline/pilot perception of GBAS and GLS and experiences and perception during daily operations. The operational section will also address GBAS benefits and based on lessons learned expectations of the airline and pilot community for the need to rapidly to exploit GBAS potential in noise reduction and shorter approach paths and extended service volume of GBAS and additional operational capabilities like GBAS CAT II approaches against a CAT I system. A recurring topic is also the RNP-GLS transition, which is key to address operational improvements in terms of flight efficiency and environment while maintaining the precision approach capability. The Newark GBAS station encountered GPS radio frequency interference caused by illegal personal devices. Honeywell and the FAA worked together to develop technical and procedural mitigations for the encountered jamming. The mitigations are designed to allow the GBAS to safely operate during frequent RFI events. Modifications to the SLS-4000 were completed by Honeywell and this modified version of the system was approved in September 2012 and is now being used operationally at Newark as well as all other U.S. SLS-4000 sites.},

abstract={This paper presents our study for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Data Communications Program Office to determine the potential use of its domestic Data Communications (Data Comm) system by Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs). As part of the future integration of UAS, especially those operating beyond line of sight (BLOS), into the National Airspace System (NAS), Data Comm is expected to have an increasing role in Air Traffic Control (ATC). The objective of this study is to determine the potential impact on the current design of the Air/Ground (A/G) Data Comm system in order to support UAS operations. We present architectural alternatives to address service provision to UAS, and examine the impact on the Data Comm system requirements such as communications latency performance and mobility management. Alternative architectures were based on scenarios for UAS with and without Very High Frequency (VHF) Digital Link-Mode 2 (VDL-2) radios. For UAS without VDL-2 radio onboard, we analyzed a Ground to Ground (G/G) architecture). For Unmanned Aircrafts (UAs) with VDL-2 radio onboard, we considered a relay architecture where Data Comm messages are relayed through the UA to the Pilot-in-Command (PIC).},

abstract={Summary for Secure Dialogue Service Approach The original Doc 9705 Edition 3 approach to ATN Security is a validated standard. It has the disadvantage that its implementation in the ULCS introduces significant complexity to the ULCS and requires that the complete ULCS be replaced. The proposed Secure Dialogue Service approach would simplify the implementation of ATN Security • Security is all performed in the same place, i.e., in the Secure Dialogue Service sub-layer The Doc 9880 ULCS (Draft Version 2) has been updated to remove the security features. This version is equivalent to Doc 9705 Edition 2 but with PDRs incorporated The Secure Dialogue Service provides implementation options: ➢ It can not be implemented or implemented and used or not depending or the operational domain ➢ In any case the applications and ULCS would be the same The Secure Dialogue Service has the added advantage that it can be used in the ATN/IPS stack.},

The influence of cell pitch and gate resistor on destruction is explored and the occurrence of current fllamentation is proposed to be a necessary condition for destruction. In order to validate this hypothesis, transient isothermal two-dimensional (2D) multi-cell simulations are performed. The simulation results reproduce the experimental results very well and reveal that the most critical conditions for fllamentation occur at that gate resistor value at which the discussed IGBT exhibits strongest avalanche generation. To replace the time demanding multi-cell simulations, an alternative simulation approach based on the occurrence of negative differential resistance in half-cell output characteristics is proposed and verified.},

pages={153-167},
abstract={A recurrent fuzzy neural cerebellar model articulation network (RFNCMAN) fault-tolerant control of a six-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) position servo drive is proposed in this study. First, the fault detection and operating decision method of the six-phase PMSM position servo drive is developed. Then, an ideal computed torque controller is designed for the tracking of the rotor position reference command. In general, it is impossible to design an ideal computed control law owing to the uncertainties of the six-phase PMSM position servo drive, which are difficult to know in advance for practical applications. Therefore, the RFNCMAN, which combined the merits of a recurrent fuzzy cerebellar model articulation network and a recurrent fuzzy neural network, is proposed to estimate a nonlinear equation included in the ideal computed control law with a robust compensator designed to compensate the minimum reconstructed error. Furthermore, the adaptive learning algorithm for the online training of the RFNCMAN is derived using the Lyapunov stability to guarantee the closed-loop stability. Finally, the proposed RFNCMAN fault-tolerant control system is implemented in a 32-bit floating-point DSP. The effectiveness of the six-phase PMSM position servo drive using the proposed intelligent fault-tolerant control system is verified by some experimental results.},

abstract={Night time flights are a relatively untouched field of application for small unmanned aerial systems (sUASs) in part due to the risks associated. However, there are many opportunities for agricultural, environmental or surveillance applications when night flying missions can be valuable or necessary. Undoubtedly, there are many risks associated with flying a sUAS at night that must be thoroughly addressed to ensure the safety to the public and property. While the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) currently has severe restrictions for night flying missions, it is necessary to investigate methods to enable them in a safe manner. This paper, for the first time, introduces the development of a lighting system for a sUAS operating within line of sight and the development of mission protocols to address the human factors. The paper is based on the developments in night flying airworthiness and efforts in obtaining an FAA COA for night flying operations.},

abstract={While incremental steps are being taken to integrate unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into the various national airspace systems, much work remains to establish appropriate regulatory infrastructure that allows UAS larger than 55 lb to operate for commerce or hire. The magnitude of that effort is compounded by the wide-ranging variety of UAS types and possible applications, as well as the diversity in quality and provenance of UAS components. The FAA has suggested developing design standards tailored to specific applications and operating environments as an approach to facilitate integration and safe operation of some UAS. This paper introduces a case study to investigate design standards for a midsize unmanned rotorcraft operating in a rural environment. A key aspect of this study is the concept of using a certifiable containment system, different from a conventional geofencing application, to ensure that the unmanned aircraft does not escape its intended operational area. The proposed assured containment system is expected to reduce the effort needed to regulate some UAS that could not currently meet rigorous aircraft design standards and fall outside of the parameters for operation outlined in the proposed small UAS rule. This paper discusses how assured containment may be a useful approach to limiting risk and reducing an otherwise prohibitive certification burden to enable UAS operations in confined areas. The case study examines the potential effect the assured containment approach might have on airworthiness certification requirements.},

abstract={As unmanned aerial systems (UASs) become ever more ubiquitous with National Airspace (NAS) commercial and civilian operations, test sites and proving grounds need to be developed and heavily researched. Small UASs are being used as remote sensing systems, on demand, at the personal level, thus “personal remote sensing” scientific data drones urgently need Ground Truthing Test Sites beyond compliance adherence. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has established six national UAS test sites and there are numerous amounts of indoor test sites found in literature and research; however, the national UAS test sites may be out of range for most researchers or exclusive and indoor test sites lack the variability and testing capabilities for GPS that an outdoor test site has to offer. The Mechatronics, Embedded Systems and Automation (MESA) Lab at the University of California, Merced has begun development of an innovative outdoor test site for small scientific data drones. Careful adherence to FAA regulation is achieved through the use of a hangar and netted structure, ensuring all flights are in an enclosed environment while maintaining an adequate and crucial GPS signal. The convergent thinking, design and development are presented in this paper.},

abstract={A military training radio network requires support for a large number of mobile nodes with heterogeneous traffic and real-time requirements. We propose a deterministic protocol and an admission control using real-time analysis for a centralized radio network with a multichannel base station. The admission control implements an algorithm for frequency allocation to mobile nodes, and guarantees timely treatment of real-time traffic. The proposed online heuristic frequency allocation algorithm is compared to other known heuristic algorithms: round robin over channels and fill one channel first. The goal with the heuristic algorithms is to maximize the number of supported mobile nodes. Our results show that when the high utilization part of the traffic have shorter deadlines it is advantageous to differentiate different types of nodes onto separate frequencies, whilst if the deadline is increased it is advantageous to mix different types of nodes on each frequency.},

abstract={One of the biggest advantages introduced by the Smart Grid is the ability to efficiently and simply integrate renewable energy sources that appear to be intermittent because of their dependence on phenomena that are not constant but that are an important energy supply if properly exploited. The realization of a smart grid, however, requires an infrastructure able to handle almost instantaneous bidirectional communication between each node of the network. All this involves the management of huge data flows in terms of analysis and control, requiring a structure capable of handling responses in a very short time and an high level of global analysis to prevent or minimize problems. Successful negotiation and brokering on the Energy Market is an important prerequisite for achieving the advantages of Smart Grid. In this paper we present a Market for the sale of energy using a completely distributed approach based on P2P protocols and server-less technology, providing a greater level of security by exploiting the properties of this type of networks. We propose a scenario animated by three actors: Consumer, Producer and Market Manager.},

abstract={Distribution of multimedia content through the Internet has become a trend in the present technology-aged community. There is a need to ensure the quality of service (QoS) is conserved especially in bandwidth estimation to support multimedia demand limited by infrastructure constraint. The challenge is then to produce bandwidth management that are adaptable and efficient for varying traffic conditions. In this paper, an improved probe-rate method to measure available bandwidth called Bandshaper was proposed and implemented on existing bandwidth estimation tool, Pathload. The method takes advantage on the Self-Loading of Periodic Streams (SLoPS) technique which exploit the one-way delay algorithm and decrease the grey region of available bandwidth. Hence, it improves the estimation accuracy and computation time of the original technique.},

abstract={Small and inexpensive computing devices are becoming potential players in the Internet arena as they are used for collecting or generating information and later relay them to the designated servers. The information gathered must be adequately protected against all kinds of attacks during storage and communication. However, smart constrained devices have limited resources and unable to run most of the classical protocols that provide robust security. This article presents a lightweight mutual authentication protocol for resource constrained computing devices with high mobility. Our solution is novel as it facilitates resource constrained devices to autonomously perform mutual authentication and establish a session key with other parties without sharing common parameters. Our proposed protocol is lightweight, symmetric and requires few space for storing keys and parameters locally. The protocol is formally verified using AVISPA tool.},

abstract={The use of unmanned aircraft also known as drones is increasing in U.S. national airspace and the numbers will rise exponentially once the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) formally opens up the skies to drones in the next few years. The result will be the addition of tens of thousands of unmanned aircraft in the sky, in addition to the ever increasing manned aircraft traffic, resulting in significant safety concerns. A threat to safety that is commonly overlooked when operating an unmanned aircraft is the threat of a hostile takeover. A hostile third party can wreak havoc in the skies with a malicious drone traversing the airspace with ominous intentions. Whether of portentous terrorist origins or merely a young experimenter testing their technical prowess, a third party controlled drone can work its way into the intake of a jetliner potentially bringing it down, or negotiate its way across the skies, ultimately crashing on innocent bystanders. The range of potential damage and human injury is considerable.},

For positive integers s, m and n = 2sm, we obtain classes of unbalanced functions with optimal algebraic immunity in the cases |U| = 2m+ 1, |V| = (2n-1)/(2m+1) and |U| = 2m-1, |V| = (2n-1)/(2m-1), respectively, where in the latter case the optimal algebraic immunity is based on correctness of the Tu-Deng conjecture. Functions belonging to both classes can be modified to be balanced ones with (potentially) optimal algebraic immunity and optimal algebraic degree, and computer experiments show that they also have high nonlinearity and good immunity against fast algebraic attacks. As by-products, variants of the Tu-Deng conjecture and combinatorial results on binary strings in analogy to it are also obtained.},

The used modeling tool is oriented to bond graph. We used the 20-sim program for the numerical solution and simulation of the proposed model. 20-sim has the advantage of model integration, enabling the automatic formulation and solution of the inherent nonlinear-implicit equations.

abstract={We propose a server less data movement architecture in which we bypass data transfer nodes, the file system stack, and the host system stack and directly move the data from one disk array controller to another in order to obtain the highest end-to-end performance. Under the current data movement architecture, separate data transfer nodes arbitrate data transfer by input/output to parallel file systems over local-area networks and parallel file systems read/write actual data from/to disks through disk controllers. Our new architecture embeds parallel file system servers and data transfer processes into a disk controller to eliminate the data path between a data transfer process and a parallel file system. This prevents the network between those two entities from being a bottleneck in end-to-end data transfer. In addition, we propose a parallel data-layout-aware data transfer, where multiple embedded data transfer processes send segments of a file concurrently while considering data layout in disks to improve data transfer performance. Our experimental results show that our proposed architecture is feasible and outperforms the traditional architecture significantly.},

abstract={Array antennas are used in near-field-focused (NFF) applications recently. Typically Focused Array Antennas (FAA) are fed by multi-level power dividers. However, when it comes to large array antennas, the design of dividers is complicated, especially for tightly arranged arrays; also a large divider may cause large inserting loss when we use low-cost materials. A novel method is proposed in this paper to simplify the feeding network of a large FAA; subarrays are used and the array is fed on the subarray level, and the required phase distribution is realized by subarray geometry as well as the simplified divider. A 4×16 FAA working at 10 GHz with a focal distance 250mm is explored, simulated results show the new array has almost the same performance on the focal plane compared to its conventional counterpart and has no forelobe along the axial line.},

abstract={As the United States (U.S.) moves toward the various phases of Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), there will be more emphasis on control of aircraft using time as well as the traditional speed control. With this in mind, Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) was directed by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in 2012 to revisit the Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards (MASPS): Required Navigation Performance (RNP) for Area Navigation (RNAV), DO-236B [1], to update the requirements for RNP RNAV systems based on lessons learned from implementing Performance Based Navigation (PBN). The committee was also asked to consider a forward look/refinement of the time-based requirements for systems. The RNP RNAV system performance standard DO-236C [2] Change 1 [3] amended existing standards from DO-236B by expanding the minimum requirement for system computed Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) in a Flight Management System (FMS). The new minimum functional requirement is that the ETA must be available for each fix in a flight plan; the previous minimum only required ETA at the “go to” fix. In an important addition, DO-236C Change 1 sets a minimum performance requirement on ETAs at all planned (future) fixes in the onboard flight profile. Thus the standard has been expanded both in the functional and the performance requirements for ETA in an RNP RNAV system.},

abstract={The En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) system is the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) automation platform used to manage air traffic at 20 en route centers in the US. This paper describes the trajectory model in the currently operational ERAM system and presents an approach to enhance ERAM's aircraft performance model with a high fidelity kinetic capability that can provide greater consistency with the guidance trajectory generated by Flight Management Systems (FMS). ERAM has a parametric trajectory predictor that uses static aircraft data. A physics-based kinetic trajectory predictor, on the other hand, can exploit flight-specific aircraft intent that will become increasingly available as the Operational Improvements in the Next Generation Air Transportation (NextGen) system are deployed. Additionally, a kinetic model will provide increased interoperability between air traffic management systems. A kinetic aircraft performance model for ERAM has been prototyped and evaluated. When flight-specific intent information is available or can be derived, the accuracy of predicting the top of descent (TOD) is significantly improved with a kinetic model. An ERAM test run with the kinetic prototype based on recorded traffic of 50 flights executing idle thrust descents shows that, relative to the baseline ERAM legacy system, the number of trajectories with along-track TOD prediction errors less than 5 nautical miles increases from 9% to 63%. Considering the incremental nature of the NextGen implementation, a low risk approach to evolving ERAM is to first move to a hybrid kinetic-parametric trajectory model, where current parametric modeling is retained and kinetic modeling is performed when flight-specific intent is available.},

abstract={The growing need for increased coordination within and across regional airspaces has resulted in the need for uniform flight data models and interoperable systems that process and disseminate flight data. The Flight Information Exchange Model (FIXM) standard provides a common framework by which regional Flight Objects (FOs) may be interpreted and exchanged. In effect, the FIXM standards provide a single intermediate representation through which real world FOs may be translated from one regional representation to another. This paper provides considerations for future enhancements of FIXM and for entities that implement and distribute FOs based on FIXM. These considerations are based on experiences learned during Phase I of the Mini Global project (Phase II is ongoing). The Mini Global demonstrations incorporated several features of interest to the development of a network centric Global Air Traffic Management (ATM) system utilized for information exchange. A Global Enterprise Messaging Service (EMS) was developed to support Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), Flight Operations Centers (FOCs), and other stakeholders. This allowed for the demonstration to test the FIXM standard and data extensions, demonstrate a capability for international partners to integrate into a global system for data exchange, and evaluate the system's ability to collect flight data for analysis. The resulting observations are grouped by their focus on governance, technical interoperability (FIXM structure and data syntax), or logical interoperability (data interpretation and usage). These observations are intended to make the lessons learned from the Mini Global demonstration available to the FIXM Working Group and to the developers of systems exchanging information based on the FIXM.},

abstract={The National Airspace (NAS) is constantly changing and adapting to new and complex challenges, and as a result Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) will need to address these important aspects. These challenges range from increased traffic flow, to reducing environmental impact, to routing efficiency, all while maintaining high safety. The FAA has recently been involved in a number of large scale Metroplex redesigns across the country to enable controllers and pilots to implement more efficient Performance-based Navigation (PBN) procedures on a regional basis. The Houston Metroplex project is one of the first to implement such a large scale change in the NAS, and it significantly changed the traffic flows into the Houston Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility (TRACON) airspace for the two major airports: Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) and Houston's William P. Hobby International Airport (HOU). This paper addresses an anomaly detection approach that has previously been used to detect operationally significant anomalous flights on approach to Denver International, Newark International, LaGuardia International, and John F. Kennedy International airports. The same method is applied to radar track surveillance data to identify anomalies in the airspace before and after the Metroplex procedure change at Houston. The study covers flights traversing through Houston TRACON (I90) and landing at IAH and HOU over a period of 2 years before and after the significant procedure change. Anomalies identified before and after the procedure change were characterized by their safety risk and operational efficiency to determine whether the types of anomalies that were discovered from before continued to exist or if they were eliminated after the procedure change or if new types of anomalies began to appear.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) system incorporates many updates to aerospace technology including coordination of air traffic management (ATM), flight deck control, and avionics architectures. One such consideration is the need for ontologies. An ontology is a formal naming and definition of the types, properties, and interrelationships of the entities that exist (and persist) for a particular domain. In aviation, an ontology is needed to organize the variables to afford computations, instructions, and the relationships between parameters. For example Triples are used as Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs) in the case of {subject, predicate (verb), object}. The subject and object entities can be connected with the relationship predicate. Together, they are an event such as an ontology coordinating Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) flight weather information. In this paper, we explore the concepts of ontologies for applications to aerospace avionics as motivated by the NextGen and Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) standards.},

abstract={A number of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) automation systems and developmental programs interoperate to support the day-to-day operations of the National Airspace System (NAS). The integration of New Entrants (NEs), such as Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) 1 and Space Vehicle (SV) operations, into the NAS will require modification to the current state of automation. Examining the relevant operational, technical, and procedural implications of integrated NE operations, in addition to exploring the potential impacts of accelerated RPA usage on NAS dynamics, are critically important efforts necessary to understanding operational impacts to NAS systems and users. Our paper presents the potential impacts of RPA integration on two of these systems: En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) and Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS). A significant component of the impact on NAS systems comes from flight plan and related data processing since all SVs and many RPAs will fly non-standard flight patterns (e.g., RPA loitering and grid search). The processes and details of the non-traditional flight routes, as well different RPA performance specifications, need to be considered as missions are overlaid on the national jet route structure. Of particular concern and interest are the changes in air traffic control (ATC) and air traffic management (ATM) systems and sub-systems needed to address air traffic controller workload and workload complexity concerns associated with NE activities. One potential accommodation approach, presented in this paper, is the use of Dynamic Airspace Configuration both for RPA routine operations and contingency events. Additionally, we present an RPA 1 In this paper, UAS and RPA are used interchangeably without intending any difference per se. It is noted that the U.S. DoD and ICAO use RPA while NASA and the FAA use UAS. demand forecast tool developed under a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) project.

The use case scenario comprises of environmental sensing with medium fixed wing reciprocating UAS that is modelled in Houston metroplex using actual radar track traffic data on a typical day. The modeling and simulation includes mechanisms that are unique for UAS operations, such as `detect and avoid' vs. `see and avoid', different mission profiles, as well as a range of stochastic parameters including positional variance, performance variance, fuzzy conflicts, latency time in communication, and deviation from planned or intent profiles. The output variables include separation indices and the number and severity of the separation events induced by the UAS operations.

abstract={A combination of airworthiness and various operational restrictions are currently used to assure that unmanned aircraft system (UAS) operations can be conducted at an acceptable level of safety. We present a methodology to communicate these aspects in a unified way, providing a centralized record of safety risk management (SRM) activities. Central to our approach is the notion of structured argument, i.e., an explicit chain of reasoning linking safety substantiating evidence to the overall safety and airworthiness objectives. Our use of argumentation is motivated, in part, by the observations that: i) certain kinds of UAS operations currently require a safety case; ii) structured arguments are often a core component of modern safety cases, providing a convenient means to represent the underlying reasoning and to access the aggregated safety information; and iii) there exists a standardized graphical notation to present structured arguments, i.e., the goal structuring notation (GSN), which has been used in both civil and military aviation. To exemplify our methodology, we apply it to an unmanned rotorcraft system (URS), using GSN arguments to show the relationship between safety of URS operations, and various SRM measures including airworthiness, in particular a potential certification basis for type design assurance. The example illustrates how our approach can coexist with, and augment, existing safety processes by transforming SRM artifacts into assurance argument fragments.},

Lindbergh famously said “aviation would never amount to much until we learned to free ourselves from the mists.” The paper describes technology that uses enhanced vision to overcome the normal visual limitations. Vision systems, called Enhanced Flight Vision Systems, provide a potential solution to a lack of visual references. The paper describes the global certification basis for Enhanced Flight Vision Systems and how those systems can be used to eliminate visibility problems from low visibility operations. It describes a history of enhanced vision sensors and their usefulness for aircraft operations. The paper details the regulatory history behind Enhanced Flight Vision Systems and the novel way in which the regulatory basis was used to certify these systems.

The quantity and the complexity of embedded software in such systems is increasing exponentially. Reducing their cost of development is a major objective in the aeronautics and avionics industry. Research in Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) endeavours to contribute to this objective. The traditionnal approach to certifying software is to design unit tests to match low level requirements, and integration tests to validate high level requirements. Creating and running these tests require large amounts of time and money. With the recent bloom of companies specialized in UAV and small systems design, there is a need for new methods able to generate reliable codes in large projects easily, quickly, and in a cost efficient manner. Formal methods are a collection of techniques for the mathematical analysis of programs and models, which can assist in the certification of software with respect to FAA and EASA certification guidelines.},

abstract={To reduce the risk to nearby aircraft during space vehicle launches, the FAA shuts down a large column of airspace, often for hours at a time. These airspace restrictions lead to many rerouted aircraft. Recent research has explored ways to make airspace closures dynamic throughout the launch process and limit their geographic extent. This paper models the problem as a Markov decision process whose solution defines when an aircraft should be rerouted, minimizing inconvenience and cost while maintaining safety. The model captures the launch vehicle trajectory, probability of anomaly, potential debris trajectories, and air traffic. An optimization approach known as backwards induction value iteration results in a policy that recommends aircraft maneuvers. The scenario investigated in this work includes a two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral Air Force Base, commercial aircraft at 35,000 ft, and potential debris trajectories. This approach yields policies that are safe and that cause minimal disruption to the airspace.},

pages={9B2-1-9B2-14},
abstract={The demands on space access for civilian, commercial and military purposes are rising rapidly. Also, the types of operations are evolving with the introduction of commercial space operators and new launch vehicle concepts such as horizontal launches. For each launch and reentry operation, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) typically blocks large volumes of airspace and activates a set of Special Use Airspaces (SUAs). The size, shape and time frames of these airspaces, known as Aircraft Hazard Areas (AHAs), are based on factors such as launch type and the risk profile of the launch vehicle. Exclusion of these airspaces from other NAS operations requires flights to route around these areas and hence experience delays and additional operating expenses. In this paper, an approach is proposed for estimating the impact of a future space launch or reentry operations by measuring the effect of delaying or routing flights around the blocked airspaces on a sample of historical days. There are two main steps in this method. The first step is the selection of a sample of historical days with traffic similar to the schedule launch day. The second step is the assessment of the effect of delaying or rerouting the affected flights around the airspaces in the selected historical days. The results of assessment for each historical day are aggregated and reported as the mean value with expected range (90% confidence around the mean) and likely highest (90th percentile of the distribution) value.},

pages={2084-2089},
abstract={The goal of the Collaborative Trajectory Options Program (CTOP) is to improve the Air Traffic Management (ATM) and by considering National Airspace System (NAS). The business goals of the NAS' users flight and airspace restrictions, thereby operations more flexible and financially stable for those involved. During a CTOP, airlines can share their route preferences with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), combining delay and reroute. Considering that trajectory preferences will impact in the final sort to be assigned, how an airline could reduce its global delay achieving a better position to be assigned. Current solutions for this problem are based on Greedy methods. However, when a CTOP demand is initiated each airline might decide its TOS strategy without knowledge about other airline's flights. A Game Theory approach for single games (SG-CTOP) was proposed to improve the decision-making process. It was developed as an intelligence solution regarding the TOS strategy under involved uncertainty about airline competitors. A case study was conducted using real data from two airlines and 100 different CTOP demands called as SG-CTOP cycle. It was performed 100 SG-CTOP cycles to verify the SG-CTOP behavior by the time. The result analysis identified that when it was used the same strategy for every flight, after 100 SG-CTOP cycles the best strategy was to send two trajectories option for each FCA plus a NOSLOT option to fly around, regarding a maximum assigned delay to fly through the FCA. This strategy achieved a global delay of 53% less than NOSLOT strategy for every flight. When this strategy was compared with the proposed SG-CTOP model, Airline A would achieve a global delay less than, or equal, in 97% of CTOP negotiations representing a delay reduction of 537 hours for the airline.},

pages={399-404},
abstract={In this paper a distributed authentication scheme based on independent session key per access network (HOISKA) is proposed for the decentralized multi-service group key management scheme in a wireless multicast environment. It enables a handover user Mi involved in multiple multicast service subscriptions to establish the long term credential from the trusted authentication server (As) during initial registration. The Mi then securely reuses the long term credential established to derive unique session keys per access network during handover across diverse access networks. The distributed nature HOISKA enables offloading the authentication function to the area network controllers (AKDs) such that As does not participate during handover authentication signalling. This simplifies handover by reducing handover exchange signalling constituting to less handover delays. Two scenarios for HOISKA, initial handover access (IAA) and Handover Access authentication (HAA) are presented then analyzed using the delay analytical model. The HOISKA model proves efficacy in both scenarios by inducing less transmission delays with comparable level of security compared to the widely deployed authentication scheme.},

abstract={We have followed the evolution of aviation electronics from crude communications apparatus on aircraft prior to WWI through the development of a nationwide radio-based navigation system prior to WWII. Making use of the technology advances of the Second World War, a much improved VOR-based navigation infrastructure with RADAR surveillance was implemented in the second half of the 20th century. Increased air traffic and heightened concerns for safety and environmental issues fostered the need for improved and more flexible navigation. Space-based navigation was the technological gift that provided the ability to achieve improved navigation performance. Space-based navigation is not tied to a ground network of navigation aids and airways gave way to tailored routes that minimized fuel consumption, improved comfort and safety, and generally increased the efficiency of air travel. PBN/RNP is a key element in the FAA's NextGen and it is pretty certain the FAA will make good on its promise in the Roadmap to install the infrastructure and mandate RNAV/RNP in most airspace. It was suggested that the birth date of avionics was 1917. It is rather fitting that the FAA's NextGen Implementation Plan, 2014 [15] shows the program to be mostly completed by 2017, the centennial of avionics.},

abstract={This paper proposes a dataset, called ALIF, for Arabic embedded text recognition in TV broadcast. The dataset is publicly available for a non-commercial use. It is composed of a large number of manually annotated text images that were extracted from Arabic TV broadcast. It is the first public dataset dedicated to the development and the evaluation of video Arabic OCR techniques. Text images in the dataset are highly variable in terms of text characteristics (fonts, sizes, colors...) and acquisition conditions (background complexity, low resolution, non-uniform luminosity and contrast...). Moreover, an important part of the dataset is finely annotated, i.e. the text in an image is segmented into characters, paws and words, and each segment is labeled. The dataset can hence be used for both segmentation-based and segmentation-free text recognition techniques. In order to illustrate how the ALIF dataset can be used, the results of an evaluation study that we have conducted on different techniques for Arabic text recognition are also presented.},

abstract={Legacy air traffic control systems have become outdated and cannot keep up with the trending increase in airliner traffic. With the goal of modernizing the system from one of manual air traffic positioning through radar and radio communication to a network of e-enabled aircraft, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is shifting to the use of Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) as a surveillance technology with higher accuracy and less man-in-the-loop dependence. However, ADS-B in its current implementation lacks the security measures needed to provide authenticity and integrity, making it an easy target for spoofing attacks. This paper presents a message authentication scheme that (1) uses a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to verify all ADS-B signals are from FAA registered aircraft, (2) uses asymmetric cryptography to exchange a symmetric session key, and (3) uses this symmetric session key to validate data authenticity and integrity. The scheme description is followed by a discussion of its scalability and feasibility in context of the full aviation realm that it applies to, as well as the changes that would be needed in existing technologies.},

pages={315-319},
abstract={In this paper we provide detailed system level performance analysis of MU-MIMO mode in the millimeter wave (mmWave) small cells (Wi-Fi hotspots) environment. Traditional way of MIMO implementation assumes a single RF chain per antenna element, with all spatial processing done in the baseband. To overcome high pathloss in the mmWave bands, the large-aperture, very high gain arrays with a large number of elements (several hundreds) are required. Therefore we introduce partially adaptive arrays with reduced number of degrees of freedom which are implemented based on the modular antenna arrays (MAA) architecture. The scalable practical design of MAA allows creation of large-aperture, high-power antenna arrays with reduced number of RF chains at cost of decreasing the adaptability. Employing recently proposed quasi-deterministic (Q-D) model for millimeter-wave channels, it was shown that partially adaptive MAA have very small degradation in comparison with ideal fully adaptive array (FAA) in a realistic scenarios. It was shown that application of MU-MIMO mode in a mmWave small cells allows achieving up to 15-30 Gbps total throughput per cell in a multipath environment (university campus scenario) with practical antenna array design.},

The purpose of Tactigram is to integrate serverless services in useful tool demonstrating the utility of real time information exchange to the warfighter. We show how a Group Communication Service (GCS) framework provides for quick exchange of small data, and tactical torrents (SISTO) provide for file sharing used by Tactigram. The demonstration was conducted as part of the Agile Bloodhound 2014 (AB14) field event. In accordance with AB14 use case scenarios, Android devices were used to exchange images and annotations over Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) and WiFi MANETs in fully distributed manner. While the results obtained constitute a very preliminary evaluation of serverless group communication, the field test environment was very useful in highlighting critical design points (e.g., on-the-move dynamics) where enhancements of the protocol are needed.},

abstract={An intelligent integral backstepping sliding-mode control (IIBSMC) system using a recurrent neural network (RNN) is proposed for the three-dimension motion control of a piezo-flexural nanopositioning stage (PFNS) in this study. Moreover, the RNN estimator is proposed to estimate the lumped uncertainty including the system parameters and external disturbance online. Furthermore, the online tuning law for the training of the parameters of the RNN is derived using the Lyapunov stability theorem. In addition, a robust compensator is proposed to confront the minimum reconstructed error occurred in the IIBSMC system. Finally, some experimental results are given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed IIBSMC system. From the performance measurings of the proportional-integral (PI) control, sliding mode control (SMC), integral backstepping sliding-mode control (IBSMC) and IIBSMC systems, the proposed IIBSMC system has the lowest maximum, average and standard deviation of the position tracking errors for the three-dimension motion control of the PFNS.},

year={2015},
volume={},

pages={59-63},
abstract={The use of Unmanned Arial Systems (UAS) in both civil and military applications has greatly increased over the last few years. At the same time, issues related to the safety of air traffic operation arise when considering UAS insertion into non-segregated airspace. Thus, surveillance plays a key role in monitoring and controlling air traffic, enabling UASs and manned aircrafts to insure themselves against collision. Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) has been proposed as a potential solution. It empowers aircraft to automatically broadcast their locations and intents to provide enhanced situational awareness. However, the use of two different ADS-B frequencies (1090MHz or 978MHz)restricts communication between different types of aircraft mainly relating to their routine flight altitude. Aircraft with ADS-B capability is either through 978 MHz Universal Access Transceivers (UAT) on general aviation below 18,000 ft or 1090 MHz Extended Squitter (1090ES) transponders above on commercial flight. In view of the manoeuvrability of UAS with a wide flight range, it will bring safety hazards and risks related to surveillance systems, if a single-frequency ADSBis adopted in a traditional way. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel Software-Defined Radio (SDR)-basedADS-B with dual-frequency for UAS that is called SAS. It exploits the SDR technology that uses software running on a generic hardware platform to perform signal processing. The SAS can thus integrate the dual-datalink hardware devices into a single generic device, which improves flexibility and connectivity of surveillance for general use. We performed simulation studies with SDR-based BeeCube and also built its prototype implementation to verify its performance.},

abstract={In this paper, we introduce an adaptive optical wireless system that employs a finite vocabulary of stored holograms. We propose a fast adaptation approach based on a divide and conquer methodology resulting in a number of adaptation algorithms: fast angle adaptive holograms (FAA-Holograms), fast power adaptive holograms (FPA-Holograms), and fast angle and power adaptive holograms (FAPA-Holograms) and evaluate these in mobile optical wireless (OW) systems in conjugation with imaging reception. The ultimate goal is to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), to reduce the effect of intersymbol-interference (ISI), to speed up the adaptation process, and to eliminate the need to calculate the hologram in real-time at each transmitter and receiver location. The system operates at high data rates under the impact of multipath dispersion, background noise and mobility. At a data rate of 2.5 Gb/s and under eye safety regulations, the proposed FAPA-Holograms offers around 20 dB SNR in the presence of background shot noise, receiver noise, multipath dispersion, and mobility. Simulation results show that the proposed system, FAPA-Holograms, can reduce the time required to identify the optimum hologram position from 80 ms in the original beam angle and power adaptive line strip multibeam system (APA-LSMS) to about 13 ms.},

abstract={In this paper a comparison between two methods for the calculation of the hot spot temperature of a power transformer is presented. The first method is proposed by C57.91 IEEE Standard which is based on daily averages and exponential equations; on the other hand, the second method is based in differential equations and hourly measurements.

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel hybrid approach, where Fog computing features are used to support a dynamic cloud cooperation of mobile IoT devices. In particular, we introduce the so-called Mobile-IoT-Federation-as-a-Service (MI-FaaS) paradigm, according to which edge nodes operate as orchestrators to manage federations among public/private IoT clouds that enable integrated IoT applications. To this aim, we propose an algorithm to foster the federation of local IoT clouds based on an utility function accounting for the number of executed tasks to be maximized. The presented performance evaluation validates the enhancements achievable by the proposed solutions in terms of number of task requests being successfully executed.},

abstract={Load flow studies are crucial in investigations of operation and planning problems in the power systems. Traditional methods for determining load flow are based on deterministic approaches. However, the parameters of a power system (such as load and renewable power generation) may be uncertain. An exact probabilistic load flow (PLF) study requires a long CPU time due to many convolution computations involving probability density functions. This paper proposes a novel PLF method that is based on Taguchi's orthogonal arrays. The proposed method utilises a few deterministic load flow solutions that are obtained using Taguchi's method to estimate the means and standard deviations of bus voltages, phase angles, line flows, and other metrics. A load flow calculation corresponds to an experiment in Taguchi's method. An optimal experiment is also specified by considering the largest deviation from the nominal load flow solution. A 25-bus standalone power system and a modified Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 118-bus system are tested. The simulation results show that the proposed method not only requires fewer deterministic load flow solutions to perform PLF analysis than the traditional point-estimate method but also yields accurate means and standard deviations of bus voltages and line flows.},

abstract={Cluster tools each of which consists of processing modules, a transport robot, and loadlocks perform most wafer fabrication processes in semiconductor manufacturing. Recently, the lot size has been decreasing from 25 wafers to even 7-8 wafers due to the larger wafer size and circuit width reduction especially in large-scale integration manufacturing. Hence, the lot switching operation between two consecutive wafer lots occurs frequently. In this paper, we derive closed-form expressions of the makespan of the lot switching period in single-armed and dual-armed cluster tools with the given robot task sequences for the first time. With this research, the completion time of a wafer lot can be easily estimated even though its preceding or next lot is processed together during the lot switching period. Hence, the makespan can be used for integrating operation of overhead hoist transports and cluster tools and assigning wafer lots to cluster tools while minimizing the lot switching period.},

year={2015},

pages={1-4},
abstract={With the shift towards decoupling of data and control plane and the softwarization in mobile networks, delivery of mobile network control functionalities can be foreseen as over the top services. We envisage such move within the paradigm of Functionality as a Service (FaaS); a platform that can also deliver requirements of the 5th generation mobile, i.e. 5G. In this paper, we briefly explain architectural elements of mobile networks that can materialize the FaaS platform, and discuss the mobility management within the FaaS platform. Relying on these architectural elements, we propose modelling the dynamics of mobile network topology, including fixed base stations and mobile users, as a self-regulatory network. Therefore, users' mobility is provisioned and traffic flow is moved to the next point of attachment, i.e. the next base station, with no handover request from the mobile device. Clearly, there is a trade-off between keeping the abstract model up-to-date and the increased overhead of the updates. Hence, we further examine the effect of such out-of-date and insufficient information in the abstraction. The investigations are carried out in network simulator (ns-3) and it can be seen while reducing frequency of updates results in the increased packet loss, an optimal balance between overhead and packet loss can be achieved.},

abstract={Atomic operations (atomics) such as Compare-and-Swap (CAS) or Fetch-and-Add (FAA) are ubiquitous in parallel programming. Yet, performance tradeoffs between these operations and various characteristics of such systems, such as the structure of caches, are unclear and have not been thoroughly analyzed. In this paper we establish an evaluation methodology, develop a performance model, and present a set of detailed benchmarks for latency and bandwidth of different atomics. We consider various state-of-the-art x86 architectures: Intel Haswell, Xeon Phi, Ivy Bridge, and AMD Bulldozer. The results unveil surprising performance relationships between the considered atomics and architectural properties such as the coherence state of the accessed cache lines. One key finding is that all the tested atomics have comparable latency and bandwidth even if they are characterized by different consensus numbers. Another insight is that the design of atomics prevents any instruction-level parallelism even if there are no dependencies between the issued operations. Finally, we discuss solutions to the discovered performance issues in the analyzed architectures. Our analysis can be used for making better design and algorithmic decisions in parallel programming on various architectures deployed in both off-the-shelf machines and large compute systems.},

abstract={Concrete and other cementitious composites used in civil infrastructure are prone to many forms of damage. For example, cracks could occur and propagate to cause catastrophic component or system-level failure. Therefore, the objective of this study was to nano-engineer a self-sensing cementitious composite that could detect and locate damage. Integration of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) in the mortar mix design and during casting enhanced the electromechanical or sensing properties of the cementitious composites. Instead of directly dispersing MWNTs in the cement matrix, the cement-particle interface was modified using spray-coated MWNT-latex thin films deposited directly onto dry sand particles prior to mortar casting. This procedure preserved MWNT dispersions within the thin film architecture, used minimal amounts of MWNTs, was scalable, and provided dramatic sensing performance enhancements. The mechanical and electromechanical properties of mortar specimens were characterized using compressive cyclic load tests. Furthermore, an electrical resistance tomography (ERT) algorithm was used for mapping mortar specimens' spatial resistance distributions. Since their resistance was precalibrated to strain, localized changes in calculated resistance indicated damage. Spatial damage detection was validated by drilling holes in various locations in cementitious composite plates and then by mapping resistance distributions using ERT.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is undertaking a National Airspace System (NAS) modernization effort known as NextGen. NextGen includes a significant number of new system acquisitions that must be integrated with legacy NAS infrastructure which is continuously undergoing modifications in parallel. Each change to the NAS requires a safety analysis to identify and control safety risks. The FAA commissioned a software tool to assist with evaluating these safety analyses so that oversight activities may be planned accordingly. To accomplish this mission, a model of system and safety data that identifies interdependencies between NAS systems and safety hazards was developed. This model, along with a taxonomy of the data captured, can be used to identify relationships and trends in system and safety data that might otherwise be overlooked in safety analyses prepared separately for each NAS change. This paper discusses the approach used to build the integrated system safety model, the data captured to-date, and preliminary findings and trends from analysis of the model. This model can be used by safety practitioners to evaluate system changes and their contributions to existing hazards in the NAS and to focus oversight activities on systems and changes with the greatest predicted impacts on NAS safety.

One of the efficient control strategies of PMSM is based on Vector Control or Field Oriented Control. Sliding mode control (SMC) is a very popular technique to deal with uncertainties. System dynamics in such cases can be improved by combining the intelligence of fuzzy logic with the sliding mode control technique. Performance comparison of a Fuzzy sliding mode controller with Triangular and Gaussian membership functions and also with conventional PI controller and adaptive fuzzy PI controller for the vector control of a PM Synchronous Motor is carried out in this paper.

The small signal analysis of voltage controller is divided into software controller and SRC circuit. The software controller consists a PI controller and a voltage-to-frequency gain. The small signal model of SRC circuit is derived based on the assumptions where the output capacitor is small and the energy is transferred to load using controlled current source. The peak value of resonant current will be changed in proportional to the perturbation of small signal frequency command under constant load. Thereby the frequency to resonant current transfer function can be derived. Then the gains of PI voltage controller are yielded by Bode plot according to the required specifications under nominal condition. Moreover, simulated results by Simulink are carried out to analysis the controller design. In order to verify the correctness of proposed design method, a DSP-based SRC is constructed and tested by frequency response analyzer, which shows that the design and measured results are in good agreement and the bandwidth of voltage loop is near to 2 kHz.},

abstract={Two critical parameters for Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM) are the probability of satellite fault, Psat, and the probability of constellation fault, Pconst. A satellite fault is one whose root cause is only capable of affecting a single satellite; while a constellation fault has a root cause that is capable of affecting more than one satellite at the same time. This paper provides more specific definitions for each of these fault types. We describe how performance commitments supplied by Constellation Service Providers (CSPs) are used to complete the fault definitions and to estimate their probability of occurrence. Providing a precise definition of what constitutes a fault is essential so that all observers are able to agree on whether or not one has occurred. This paper is intended to lead to a framework for an open and transparent system for determining these parameters. This framework is intended to be the basis for an internationally agreed upon process for determining the fault rates that may be safely used for ARAIM.},

Integrity and continuity are addressed though determination of the probability of data mis-associations for multiple intruders. A mis-association occurs when the system incorrectly associates one intruder's measurement with another intruder's trajectory. Incorrect intruder associations are hazardously misleading information impacting integrity. This impact on integrity has a second order effect on continuity. A sensitivity analysis is performed based on two two-intruder encounters. The resulting impact of mis-associations between multiple intruders on integrity and continuity is quantified for a nominal composite SAA sensor. The sensor characteristic trade space is explored. The concepts and methods in this research are intended to be used as a tool for certification authorities to set potential requirements for integration into the national airspace system.},

abstract={Airspaces around the world are introducing capabilities and infrastructure to handle higher traffic densities. Highly capable satellite based navigation is being adopted to help aircraft operate more efficiently in the future. Furthermore, Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B), where aircraft and other users broadcast their precise position, velocity and intent, is being introduced to help manage these airspaces. This allows air traffic and other aircraft to have excellent awareness of the airspace users. Adoption of new systems and technologies will only intensify as future airspaces will have to handle more varied traffic such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). GNSS is critical to both future air navigation and ADS-B. Many of improvements in future airspace are primarily achieved with GNSS. This makes a robust, accurate terrestrial alternate essential should GNSS be unavailable. This paper examines using the Traffic Information Services Broadcast (TIS-B) service that is part of ADS-B implementation to provide terrestrial navigation. TIS-B would broadcast an aircraft position report generated using radar measurements. Conceptually, an aircraft may be able to use the reception of its own TIS-B report to provide knowledge of its position. This paper provides an overview of the concept and of the potential capabilities of the system.},

abstract={The development of new GNSS constellations, and the modernization of existing ones, has increased the availability and the number of satellites-in-view, paving the way for new navigation algorithms and techniques. These offer the opportunity to improve the navigation performance while at the same time potentially reducing the support which has to be provided by Ground and Satellite Based Augmented Systems (GBAS and SBAS). These enhanced future capabilities can enable GNSS receivers to serve as a primary means of navigation, worldwide, and have provided the motivation for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to form the GNSS Evolution Architecture Study (GEAS). This panel, formed in 2008, investigates the new GNSS-based architectures, with a focus on precision approach down to LPV-200 operations. GEAS identified ARAIM as the most promising system. The literature, produced through a series of studies, has analysed the performance of this new technique and has clearly shown that the potential of ARAIM architectures to provide the Required Navigation Performance for LPV 200. Almost all of the analysis was performed by simply studying a constellation's configuration with respect to fixed points on a grid on the Earth's surface, with full view of the sky, evaluating ARAIM performance from a geometrical point of view and using nominal performance in simulated scenarios lasting several days. In this paper, we will evaluate the ARAIM performance in simulated operational configurations. Aircraft flights can last for hours and on-board receivers don't always have a full view of the sky. Attitude changes from manoeuvers, obscuration by the aircraft body and shadowing from the surrounding environment could all affect the incoming signal from the GNSS constellations, leading to configurations that could adversely affect the real performance. For this reason, the main objective of the algorithm developed in this research project is to analyse these shadowing effects and compute the performance of the ARAIM technique when integrated with a predicted flight path using different combinations of three constellations (GPS, GLONASS and Galileo), considered as fully operational.},

abstract={System Wide Information Management (SWIM) is a key transformational information exchange program that is an important element of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). SWIM provides a mechanism for National Airspace System (NAS) and non-NAS consumers to have access to FAA-generated aeronautical, flight, and weather information. SWIM is based on a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) framework and promotes the sharing and reuse of software components in the form of published services. Currently, SWIM provides services that make it possible for consumers to obtain various types of data. For example, Traffic Flow Management (TFM) Data provides flight-related information, Integrated Terminal Weather Service (ITWS) provides terminal weather information, and Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) Distribution Service (NDS) publishes aeronautical information. By providing such data, SWIM creates new opportunities for collaboration with industry to drive innovation and create an enhanced user experience. This paper will focus on the consumption of SWIM services from one consumer's perspective, that is, The MITRE Corporation (MITRE). MITRE is a SWIM consumer which is external to the FAA and requires SWIM data for research, data-driven analytics, trend studies, and prototype development. MITRE has developed an architecture to access SWIM data feeds, and re-publish the feeds for internal MITRE development and analysis. This paper will also discuss the process of transitioning to FAA SWIM data feeds and staging SWIM data for use by MITRE systems. Finally, the paper will discuss how MITRE implemented the architecture, which may provide lessons and benefits for other SWIM consumers.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation (NextGen) program is a long-term modernization and transformation of the current National Airspace System (NAS) into a more effective and coordinated decision-making system. NextGen provides a more reliable, secure, and dependable aviation capability for both users and operators ensuring more capacity, throughput, and safety. System Wide Information Management (SWIM) is a NextGen Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) technology that communicates aviation data among the various stakeholders incorporating trajectory based operations and optimum profile descent. SWIM data is delivered to the aircrew via Aircraft Access to SWIM (AAtS) framework. This research paper investigates the information security threats and performance caveats in the main operating components of AAtS by identifying the information security breaches associated with the NAS Enterprise Message Service (NEMS), particularly its data exchange path with Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) through the Data Management Service (DMS). This research addresses the risks associated with the information flow passing through the NAS Enterprise Security Gateway (NESG) internal Data Management Zone (DMZ) and external DMZ. This research delineates the overall strategy for identifying the methodology in testing the data flow from the aircraft EFB via the NEMS network to the external service providers as well as identifying test procedures to emulate the threat vectors on this network. After conducting the necessary tests, the key technical research areas are comprehensively evaluated and recommendations to support the security of the AAtS will be documented.},

abstract={System Wide Information Management (SWIM) is a concept implemented by multiple Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) to provide efficient access to systems, services, and data used for their operations. Global SWIM utilizes identical concepts, but instead focuses on the connectivity between ANSPs instead of systems and services within an ANSP [1]. A successful Global SWIM implementation enables interconnectivity between the SWIM networks of multiple ANSPs utilizing one or more GEMS (Global Enterprise Messaging Service) providers. In order to exchange flight, weather, and aeronautical information efficiently, the GEMS providers must adapt between each ANSP's local SWIM infrastructures [2, 3]. Providing end-to-end connectivity between authoritative sources of information (ANSPs, airlines, etc.) requires multifaceted adaptation of both a technical and procedural nature. During the Mini Global II demonstration, four industry partners (Harris Corporation, Mosaic ATM, NEC Corporation, and Indra Sistemas) each developed a Global SWIM Service that interconnected, forming an interoperable network providing users with access to information produced by multiple ANSPs through a single interface. During the development of these Global SWIM Services, it was necessary to utilize common messaging standards, such as AMQP, SOAP and REST, and common data standards, such as the Aeronautical Information Exchange Model (AIXM) [4], Weather Information Exchange Model (WXXM) [5], and Flight Information Exchange Model (FIXM) [6] to enable basic message exchange to ensure interoperability between the GEMS providers. However, it was found that an additional layer of interoperability is needed to bridge the differences in governance models used by each ANSP. The additional layer of interoperability will enable GEMS providers to adhere to the governance policies of the ANSPs and organizations connected to their service, and communicate these policies to other GEMS providers. The goal of this paper is to outline a framework for encoding the governance policies of multiple ANSPs for enforcement across multiple GEMS providers.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is considering the implementation of the Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System (AeroMACS) in the National Airspace System (NAS). AeroMACS networks will provide high-data-rate communications in the airport environment in support of Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) operations. At the World Radiocommunication Conference in 2007 (WRC-07), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) added an Aeronautical Mobile (Route) Service (AM(R)S) frequency allocation in the 5091-5150 megahertz (MHz) band on an international basis, resulting in eleven 5-MHz frequency channels being available for AeroMACS within the allocation. In this paper we describe an analysis framework that could be used to evaluate the performance of AeroMACS networks, and discuss the interdependency between frequency planning and RF network planning for AeroMACS as part of the framework. AeroMACS network performance for a specific analysis scenario that incorporates aircraft, ground vehicles, and sensors supporting safety and regularity of flight was analyzed by using the framework. We also developed an initial discrete event simulation capability for in-depth evaluations of AeroMACS link performance. We used this capability to analyze link performance for data transmissions to and from potential fixed assets, such as sensors, on the airport. Link performance results are also presented. The analyses and simulations described in this paper provide inputs for the development of a spectrum planning methodology for AeroMACS.},

abstract={A Human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation was conducted to investigate the integration of two advanced aviation capabilities across both the air and ground domains: Interval Management (IM) and Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC). The IM concept was examined in a mixed communication environment. Of particular interest was the communication of the IM clearance as it is expected to be a complex communication. The simulation focused on three levels of IM clearance complexity and two different modes of communication (voice only versus voice and CPDLC). In the HITL, pilots and controllers conducted IM and had communication exchanges that were supported by automation. Controller results from the HITL are provided in this paper. The majority of controllers found the integration of the IM and CPDLC capabilities acceptable. Controllers had the most variability in their replies for the Higher Complexity clearances under both voice and CPDLC. They preferred CPDLC over voice communications. The simulation showed more communication issues when using voice as compared to when using CPDLC. The results of the HITL are expected to be used by the Federal Aviation Administration to develop requirements for IM operations and communications.},

abstract={The FAA's Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Office of Performance Analysis is responsible for developing indicators and providing analysis on the operational efficiency of the NAS and to ensure its databases provide the necessary information for linking performance to root causes. The focus of this paper is the primary indicator of capacity within a sector, the Monitor Alert Parameter (MAP), an indicator designed to alert personnel when traffic levels in a given sector may be at a level that will affect the efficiency of the system. Over the past decade, however, it has come under some criticism for being too simplistic in its calculation with the obvious implication that some MAP values do not represent the real trigger point at which the balance between sector capacity and traffic volume require a closer look. A search for studies on this subject yields sparse results with cursory connections. This paper will review and analyze the current FAA policy for MAP and discuss the challenges and potential shortfalls of the current implementation of baseline MAP values. Further, it will discuss the challenges associated with measuring the effectiveness of this tool. Finally, this paper draws conclusions and makes recommendations focused on enabling a more comprehensive analysis of sector capacity limitations on the efficiency of the NAS.},

abstract={This study is to develop a procedure to estimate the market share of itinerant GA operations (MSIGO) by aircraft type at an airport. The procedure can be used, for example, by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and airport planners to make projections of itinerant operations by aircraft type for airport planning and improvements. Our procedure consists of two sub-procedures. The first one is a national level logistic model which separates the MSIGO by three fixed-wing aircraft types (i.e., piston, turboprop, and turbofan) from the other aircraft types. The second sub-procedure includes an airport-level logistic model and a national level estimation model. The airport-level logistic model is to estimate the MSIGO by each of the three fixed-wing aircraft types under IFR flight plan. The national level estimation model is designed to estimate the MSIGO by aircraft type under all flight rules. We validated our procedure using the statistics reported in the Air Traffic Activity System. In addition, we applied our procedure to the projections of itinerant GA operations made by the FAA in the Terminal Area Forecasting. Based on our results for the towered airports, between 2013 and 2018, the number of itinerant operations by piston and turboprop would decline at about 0.2% per year, and the number of itinerant operations by turbofan and the other aircraft types would increase at 0.75% and 1.33% per year, respectively.},

abstract={Significant efforts are underway to modernize global air traffic management systems. Flight efficiency is a major political design criterion. This paper addresses the identification and measurement of ATM related constraints on vertical flight efficiency with a focus on continuous descent operations. Efficiency of flight operations has become a key driver for identifying bottlenecks and constraints imposed by ATM on airspace user preferred flight trajectories. In particular, measures aiming at fuel-efficient operations attract a lot of attention. This paper reports on the work jointly performed by the FAA and EUROCONTROL to address vertical flight efficiency. Based on an empirical study of trajectory data for US and European airports, a vertical profile analysis algorithm has been developed considering research experiences and stakeholder consultations of both teams. This work was performed as the preparatory action of the joint US/Europe comparison report. The results include a joint and harmonized algorithm to describe the vertical trajectory profile and the initial definition of metrics for the performance measurement. This harmonized algorithm will be further be validated and refined as part of the US/Europe comparison report including a wider set of airports. Demonstrating the general feasibility, the algorithm will be further promoted for use in international performance activities under ICAO.},

ATS and AOC communication systems will rely on several ATN/IPS-based (Aeronautical Telecommunication Network/Internet Protocol Stack) air-ground data links for data-centric communication, either via satellite (e.g. Iris precursor) or directly via a ground station (e.g. LDACS, AeroMACS). Highly reliable communications between aircraft and ground will be a key factor to support the future operational procedures. Given this background, we propose erasure coding over multiple air-ground links to increase the reliability of the data communications between aircraft and ground for latency sensitive procedures. Adding redundancy and spreading the packets over multiple links reduces the end-to-end packet loss ratio and subsequently latency, even in case of link failures, at the cost of increasing the load on the airground links. ICAO defines quality of service provided to aeronautical data communications in terms of the Required Communication Performance (RCP) metric [1]. This metric is used to measure reliability at application layer with four parameters: transaction time, continuity, integrity and availability. Draft data communications requirements of future ATC and AOC services have been specified by Eurocontrol and FAA in the “Communication Operational Concept and Requirements for the Future Radio System” (COCR) document using the RCP parameters [2]. With the objective of evaluating the impact of multi-link erasure coding for meeting the RCP, a testbed has been developed in the European research project ACROSS. This testbed is an evolution of the SANDRA (Seamless Aeronautical Networking through integration of Data-links, Radios, and Antennas) European research project testbed. The SANDRA testbed implements the network aspects related to the ATN/IPS protocol stack (IPv6, MIPv6, IPsec, etc.) according to ICAO's specification in the ATN/IPS standards and recommended practices [3]. The most important feature of the ACROSS testbed for future aeronautical data communications is the Communication Performance Manager (CPM; instances of the CPM are deployed on the aircraft and on ground). This paper describes how the CPM is implemented and how it ensures that the performance, measured with the RCP, is met using the available air-ground links. The CPM employs erasure codes when necessary and forwards the encoded packets over one or more air-ground links (air-to-ground and ground-to-air). This enables the provision of higher performance than any single link could provide on its own. The performance provided by the CPM is limited by the available air-ground links characteristics and the amount of added redundancy used. In order to meet the RCP, the CPM monitors the status of the air-ground links to calculate the most efficient coding scheme for the traffic of each ATC and AOC service. The actual communication performance provided by the communications system using the CPM is evaluated in the ACROSS testbed by emulating the traffic generated by future aeronautical data communications. The testbed's ground network is composed of multiple geographical locations, so that different conditions can be configured by having the emulated aircraft fly over different regions types (airport, continental, oceanic and polar). The ACROSS testbed will be used to validate the multi-link erasure coding technique and analyze the achievable performance with the current airground data links as well as the future scenario with new air-ground links and future ATC and AOC data communications.},

abstract={A key component to solving many of the engineering challenges for integrating UAS into the National Airspace System (NAS) is being able to state within discrete airspace, the numbers of forecasted UAS by airframe type and the type of mission or operational use being performed.In general, there is not a demand forecast that is tightly coupled to the real purpose of the mission requirements (e.g. in terms the real locations of physical structures such as windmills to inspect, farms to survey, pipelines to patrol, etc.). Being able to present a solid basis for the demand is crucial to get the attention of investment, government and other fiscal planners. To this end, Mosaic ATM under a NASA guidance is preparing a crowd sourced, demand forecast engine for commercial and government organizational users to drawn upon and be able to share vetted and accurate projection data. The UAS Demand Generator for Discrete Airspace Density (UAXPAN) project creates a common solution in forecasting the growth and use of numerous unmanned systems and numerous mission types. Users of the system can produce datadriven forecasts of UA usage patterns, and use plugin application solvers to further their analysis of the results (e.g., predicting cellular communications link demand).},

abstract={A current focus at the FAA-designated New York Griffiss International Airport Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Test Site is research and development for a robust, next-generation ground-based sense and avoid system (GBSAA) capable of enabling routine UAS operations in terminal area and transition airspace. Griffiss has installed a test range instrumentation system. The initial instrumented UAS test range provides cooperative and noncooperative surveillance of air traffic in Griffiss Class D airspace, extending about 45 NM to the north of the airport and its Class D airspace. The Griffiss UAS test range instrumentation system employs a combination of wide area multilateration, ADS-B, and 3-D primary radar to track air traffic. An extensive data collection system supports the instrumented test range in order to meet needs for data analysis and to support development of the safety case for UAS integration into terminal and transition airspace. The system design incorporates an ability to supplement live air traffic surveillance data with virtual and constructive data, as well as a support for cooperative networked testing with federal test centers in a distributed environment. This paper focuses on baseline requirements for the current Griffiss test range instrumentation system and its evolution as a research UAS GBSAA system. The paper discusses multilateration and the rationale for using wide area multilateration (WAM) as the foundation for a research GBSAA capability, incorporating UAS remote flight crew, command and control, and ATC support functions. A baseline system logical architecture is described. This logical architecture will be used to incorporate and assess use of new GBSAA sensors, displays and controls to support surface, terminal and transition area UAS self-separation and collision avoidance standards and operational practices. Development of the Griffiss UAS range instrumentation system and its logical architecture recognizes that future ground and airborne SAA systems will be integrated, and that, beyond the baseline requirements addressed in this paper, much further work needs to be performed.},

abstract={Operation of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) require the same degree of pre-flight and mission planning as that preformed for manned aircraft. The goal of routine operations has an evolving safety case which must include the review of actions and conditions of the aircraft and the pilot during normal, off-nominal, abnormal and emergency events. UAS flight planning is currently a manually intensive process, and trying to replicate a pilot's decision making course of actions for mission contingencies is an exceptionally tedious and lengthy activity. Additionally, the incorporation of contingency/emergency routes is left up to the planner and there is no guarantee of sufficiency or consistency of contingency plans when activated. To support the recurring assessment of these actions, Mosaic ATM has performed a 2 year NASA project to development a mission safety assessment and contingency support tool called Aviate. Our project objective is to automate the UA contingency flight planning process providing uniform accounting to known conditions, hazards, and other factors. We will field, increasingly, a capable product suite that supports the mission planner, the air traffic controller, the PIC, and the onboard intelligent piloting function. This will provide a level of confidence and an equivalent level of safety to unmanned aircraft mission planning prior to any UAS departures from airfields in the NAS or flights into through the NAS.},

abstract={Air Traffic Management helps to ensure all National Airspace System (NAS) operators have the opportunity to safely accomplish their operational goals while maintaining NAS efficiency. Advancements in technology and a robust global demand for access to space are leading to new space flight participants and increasing numbers of space launch and reentry operations, adding complexity to NAS management coordination and decision-making processes. Diversity of launch and reentry profiles and locations, coupled with increased activity [1, 2], will impact airspace management planning by requiring increased coordination among the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other federal agencies, civilian facilities, and commercial operators. Current processes will not scale as space activity in the NAS increases. The MITRE Corporation is working with the FAA to improve launch and reentry operations efficiency and repeatability. The approach includes analyzing current processes and identifying how more standardized communication mechanisms, integrated information flows, and consistent analysis capabilities can be applied. This paper describes a concept for sharing information and integrating it as part of a standardized, repeatable process that can help the FAA meet future space activity needs in the NAS. A key feature is to integrate information related to NAS effects assessment into the process to facilitate rapid analysis and feedback.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the MITRE Corporation (MITRE), among other entities, are working together to integrate space launch and re-entry operations into the National Airspace System (NAS). As part of the effort, MITRE is building a flexible, fast-time Monte Carlo modeling and simulation capability that offers operational measures of safety. Once validated, the FAA can use it to assess different separation concepts and associated standards, and support the FAA's Safety Management System process. The developed capability will help the FAA determine what separation concepts and associated standards ensure safety for each space launch and re-entry operation and will provide insight into the required surveillance performance, air traffic control response times, and traffic limits to enable new separation concepts. MITRE built the capability using our models for aircraft flight trajectories, aircraft-to-aircraft conflict prediction and detection, and surveillance performance. To tailor these models for use in examining space launch and re-entry operations, MITRE also developed a space vehicle trajectory model and debris model (based on Stanford University's work-Range Safety Assessment Tool) for use in the simulation of the scenarios. This paper focuses on describing the modeling capabilities, algorithms, and some preliminary simulation results.},

abstract={Ongoing measurement of system performance is an essential input to management of the National Airspace System (NAS) by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). MITRE has been working with the Air Traffic Management System Command Center (ATCSCC) since 2000 to provide new performance metrics and data visualizations to better measure and understand system performance, and inform changes to behavior to reduce delays in the future. Accurate measurement of the portion of system performance attributable to FAA action is difficult, as several factors outside the FAA's control heavily influence performance metrics, including weather and user traffic demand. So the detection of anomalous performance, either on a particular day, or in a longer term trend, can be challenging. The research described in this paper outlines an approach to develop a set of data visualizations to identify performance anomalies for the FAA, focusing primarily on block time and flown distance. This approach is focused on developing triggers to identify anomalies, both for individual days and in trends. It uses an approach utilizing statistical regression, which will be described in detail. The calculation of the metric and its baseline value will be described in the paper. In the examples which will be documented in the paper, in both the static and dynamic cases, the control limits are based on a 95th percentile of the average daily values during a 2012-2014 baseline period. In the static case, it is based on the statistical distribution of the metric itself (average daily block times above a baseline value) over the baseline time period. In the dynamic case, it is based on the statistical distribution of the residuals from the regression, which models the metric as a function of a daily weather index (ASPM weighted weather index). By using this dynamic approach, a day is triggered as an anomaly for further attention not simply because it is a large value, but because it is larger than the expected normal range for that metric after weather is factored out. In the paper the approach will be extended to include multiple factors, not just weather. All included factors will be those outside the control of the FAA (exogenous). By doing this, the remaining (residual) variation in the metric's behavior, after factoring out the exogenous factors, will be more representative of actual system performance which can be affected by changes in FAA actions. An additional method will also be described to identify anomalies in trends, using a similar statistical approach.},

abstract={Landing high-drag, low-inertia light sport and experimental aircraft requires significant pilot cognitive workload, causing this to be one of the most dangerous phases of flight for these types of aircraft. Reducing pilot workload through a standardized landing procedure will help maximize safety during landing. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) provides many commercial aircraft with standardized procedures for landing, but the same level of support does not exist for light sport and experimental aircraft. In order to calculate a landing approach that can be customized to multiple light sport and experimental aircraft, a model has been developed to test various speed and power combinations with the given runway parameters to determine the best approach(es) for that given aircraft and runway. The simulation model is used to minimize the workload required by ensuring that only the engine power (revolution per minute-RPM) or the approach airspeed (miles per hour) variable remains constant throughout the landing sequence. Since the pilot needs to adjust the speed and power settings in order to follow the landing procedure, keeping one of these parameters constant will minimize pilot workload.},

abstract={Since 2013 Unmanned Aerial Systems, commonly called drones, have become a disruptive technology in the consumer market and the National Airspace System due to their decreasing costs and increased consumer interest. Sales of drones have experienced growth in excess of 500 percent from 2014 to 2016. According to the Federal Aviation Administration the number of incidents involving drones has also grown. The Federal Aviation Administration currently provides few regulations for drones, instead offering advisories to drone operators. In order to determine a course of action for safe integration, the Federal Aviation Administration instituted a pilot reporting database of incidents involving drones. In over 97% of the incidents reported, the drone operators were not following altitude and location advisories. This paper examines the effectiveness of geofencing systems for drones and compares its effectiveness to the current proposed regulations and traditional collision avoidance systems. A Monte Carlo simulation using growth and incident rates of drones based on the incident data is used to determine the utility of each alternative. The alternatives are then analyzed through a utility function and evaluated on a cost/utility basis. The result shows that limiting flight operations to the regulated thresholds provides a cost effective method for adding safety to the operation of drones within the National Airspace System.},

abstract={The average age of commercial aircraft operating domestic flights in the United States is 10.7 years and continues to increase. Advances in robotics and imaging technologies show potential to reduce costs, time and to improve quality of fuselage inspections. A stochastic simulation was developed to evaluate the inspection process. The simulation represents differences in inspection techniques for components of the aircraft, such as the landing gear compared to the lap-splice panels, by categorizing the aircraft with ten representative regions. Simulation results indicates a decrease in the time required to complete inspection while simultaneously improving the overall quality in crack detection by the use of emerging non-destructive inspection technologies in aircraft maintenance: non-contact laser-ultrasonic (average savings of 43.28 minutes per section per inspection), synthetic aperture imaging drone (average savings of 45.60 minutes), and thermographic robotic crawler (crack detection rate increase of 54% with an average increase of 26.86 minutes per section). Using a utility hierarchy focused on performance, safety, and ability to implement, the most viable technological alternatives rank: non-contact laser-ultrasonic with a utility value of 0.824, human inspector with a utility of 0.811, synthetic aperture imaging with a utility of 0.783, and thermographic robotic crawler with a utility of 0.748. Based on the simulation results and utility analysis, it is recommended that MRO facilities implement non-contact laser ultrasonic technology as a method to scan the exterior of their aircraft to detect widespread fatigue damage.},

abstract={In construction of parallel runways, currently the mainstream of airport runway configuration, the Closely Spaced Parallel Runways (CSPRs) are frequently employed. This paper first analyzed the different utilization modes of CSPRs with flush or staggered threshold. After which the simulation software “Simmod” was applied to establish computer simulation models for different utilization modes of runways with staggered threshold. In addition, systematic analysis and quantitative evaluation on airport capacity and operational efficiency under such circumstance were conducted. The simulation result suggests: under the existing air traffic control operation rules, a set of CSPRs is capable to support 765~815 movements in each peak day, and around 55 movements in each peak hour. When the inside runway threshold is staggered towards the approach direction and bypass taxiway is provided, the most efficient mode is landing on the inside runway and taking-off from the outside runway. Compared with other modes, it promotes the operation efficiency by about 5%.},

abstract={In this work we propose a semantic-aware blocking framework for entity resolution (ER). The proposed framework is built using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) techniques to efficiently unify both textual and semantic features into an ER blocking process. In order to understand how similarity metrics may affect the effectiveness of ER blocking, we study the robustness of similarity metrics and their properties in terms of LSH families. We further discuss how the semantic similarity of records can be captured, measured, and integrated with LSH techniques over multiple similarity spaces. We have evaluated our proposed framework over two real-world data sets, and compared it with the state-of-the-art blocking techniques. The experimental study shows that using a combination of semantic features and textual features can considerably improve the quality of blocking. Due to the probabilistic nature of LSH, this semantic-aware blocking framework also enables us to build fast and reliable blocking for performing entity resolution tasks in a large-scale data environment.},

abstract={As one of the most popular forms of transportation, the airliner involves risks and its safety has always been a critical concern for all passengers and crew members. Airliner incidents indicate that when pilots are manipulated by hijackers or the pilots intend to commit suicide: the airliner may either crash or be shot down due to its potential for suicide attack. To address these risks, we target at the critical operations under specific context which could potentially crash the airliner if there is no intervention to prohibit them. We propose an efficient, authenticated, secure solution which could enable the air traffic controller to intervene or even to prohibit the critical but dangerous operations. Our solution could successfully mitigate the risk of the single point of compromise when either a pilot or an air traffic controller has the unlimited privilege over the airliner. The experimental result also shows that the proposed solution demonstrates efficiency in terms of computational cost and it is feasible to be fitted in the aviation system.},

volume={},

pages={1-11},
abstract={The FAA annually invests approximately $3B in small commercial and general aviation airports, with additional infrastructure investments appropriated at the state level. Accurate airport operations counts are critical for fair and efficient allocation of federal and state funds for airport development and improvement. Of the 3,331 airports in the United States that constitute the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems, however, only slightly more than 500 have either full-or part-time air traffic control facilities and associated personnel who are available to manually register those counts. There are several methods used to count aircraft operations at airports lacking full-time personnel; these are generally based on traditional statistical sampling techniques. Sample data is typically obtained by employing short-term contract staff to deploy acoustic and pneumatic counting devices and to provide human observations. The sample sizes associated with these methods are inherently small due to financial constraints. Small sample sizes create difficulties in terms of estimation of the population mean and variance from the sample parameters because the normality assumption of the distribution of the sample means may not hold. Two modifications to the estimation procedure are suggested here. The first employs a Frequentist model based on sampling without replacement from a discrete, finite, uniformly-distributed population. The second involves a Monte Carlo simulation and associated Bayesian hierarchical model using a Poisson likelihood function, which incorporates the inherent Poisson nature of the underlying arrival process and assumes uncertainties in the registration of operations counts. The latter approach is shown to improve substantially the accuracy of both the traditional, unmodified predictor and the Frequentist modification.},

abstract={Congressional attention to Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)1 has caused the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to move the National Airspace System (NAS) Integration project forward, but using guidelines, practices and procedures that are yet to be fully integrated with the FAA Aviation Management System. The real drive for change in the NAS will to come from both UAS operators and the government jointly seeing an accurate forecast of UAS usage demand data. This solid forecast information would truly get the attention of planners. This requires not an aggregate demand, but rather a picture of how the demand is spread across small to large UAS, how it is spread across a wide range of missions, how it is expected over time and where, in terms of geospatial locations, will the demand appear. In 2012 the Volpe Center performed a study of the overall future demand for UAS. This was done by aggregate classes of aircraft types. However, the realistic expected demand will appear in clusters of aircraft activities grouped by similar missions on a smaller geographical footprint and then growing from those small cells. In general, there is not a demand forecast that is tightly coupled to the real purpose of the mission requirements (e.g. in terms of real locations and physical structures such as wind mills to inspect, farms to survey, pipelines to patrol, etc.). Being able to present a solid basis for the demand is crucial to getting the attention of investment, government and other fiscal planners. To this end, Mosaic ATM under NASA guidance is developing a crowd sourced, demand forecast engine that can draw forecast details from commercial and government users and vendors. These forecasts will be vetted by a governance panel and then provide for a sharable accurate set of projection data. Our paper describes the project and the technical approach we are using to design and create access for users to the forecast system.},

However under current and proposed FAA regulations, all UAV's must be piloted by people to fly in the national airspace.

abstract={Part 23 aircraft operation, and in particular general aviation, is relatively unsafe when compared to other common forms of vehicle travel. Currently, there exists technologies that could increase safety statistics for these aircraft; however, the high burden and cost of performing the requisite safety critical certification processes for these systems limits their proliferation. For this reason, many entities, including the Federal Aviation Administration, NASA, and the US Air Force, are considering new options for certification for technologies which will improve aircraft safety. Of particular interest, are low cost autopilot systems for general aviation aircraft, as these systems have the potential to positively and significantly affect safety statistics. This paper proposes new systems and techniques, leveraging run-time verification, for the assurance of general aviation autopilot systems, which would be used to supplement the current certification process and provide a viable path for near-term low-cost implementation. In addition, discussions on preliminary experimentation and building the assurance case for a system, based on these principles, is provided.},

title={A limited investigation of airplane response to flap extension},
year={2016},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-8},
abstract={This paper examines airplane response to flap extension on four general aviation (GA) airplanes. The scenario involves a pilot flying in the traffic pattern who becomes distracted, abruptly extends flaps while looking outside the airplane, and fails to notice airspeed and pitch-attitude changes. In the Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) $23.143, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires no more than 50 pounds of pitch wheel force to arrest any un-commanded airplane pitch response [1]. The airplanes tested in this report had pitch forces less than 40 pounds. Despite satisfying the FAA requirement, data gathered in-flight showed a pitch-up to more than 30 degrees in 5 seconds after flap extension, subsequently causing airspeed to drop below stall speed for three of the airplanes. If the pilot did not compensate for this response with positive pitch inputs on the controls, the airplanes would have stalled. At traffic pattern altitudes, stalling an airplane can be fatal. The National Transportation Safety Board listed over 1000 accidents caused by loss-of-control in the traffic pattern between 1982 and 2015 [2]. Since GA airplanes don't carry flight data recorders, we don't know how many of those accidents may have involved stalls caused by un-commanded response after flap extension. From the data we gathered in-flight, it seems possible some were. To improve safety, airplane developers could interconnect flaps with the elevator, reduce horizontal tail size, or use a T-tail. The FAA should consider reducing the maximum pitch stick and wheel forces in CFR $23.143 to 10 pounds or less.},

It uses the Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm technique and the Step Method in order to optimize all objectives of a given problem, thus providing a greater number of possible solutions. The goals set to the multi-objective function are the maximization of restored customers, minimization of Joule losses and the number of switching maneuvers in the network for the restoration, which are subject to operational constraints. The software features a set of non-dominated solutions, providing the operator with the option to choose from several effective configurations. The grid is modeled by using the node-depth representation (NDR), and the operating constraints evaluated by the forward / backward sweep load flow method. The 16-bus IEEE test system and a proposed 41-bus test system are used to analyze the response of the developed application, which presents good performance and can be safely used by radial distribution system operators.},

abstract={Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) are being used commonly for video surveillance, providing valuable video data and reducing the risks associated with human operators. Thanks to its benefits, the UAS traffic is nearly doubling every year. However, the risks associated with the UAS are also growing. According to the FAA, the volume of air traffic will grow steadily, doubling in the next 20 years. Paired with the exponential growth of the UAS traffic, the risk of collision is also growing as well as privacy concerns. An effective UAS detection and/or tracking method is critically needed for air traffic safety. This research is aimed at developing a system that can identify/detect a UAS, which will subsequently enable counter measures against UAS. The proposed system will identify a UAS through various methods including image processing and mechanical tracking. Once a UAS is detected, a countermeasure can be employed along with the tracking system. In this research, we describe the design, algorithms, and implementation details of the system as well as some performance aspects. The proposed system will help keep the malicious or harmful UAS away from the restricted or residential areas.},

abstract={While the current legal and policy landscape was not created with the SUAS threat in mind, it is still flexible enough to address it. At the same time, it could use some refinement. In the short-term, educating SUAS operators on current regulations is a wise approach. If good intentioned operators follow the rules, the bad actors will be more readily apparent to everyone else. Relying on the good graces in individuals might be a good interim measure, but any long-term solution to the SUAS threat will require scientists, engineers, lawyers and policy makers to collaborate to both solve the technical problems and create the regulatory and statutory framework to implement it. This will require a three-pronged approach of working within the existing FAA regulatory framework; leveraging state and federal legislation; and seeking additional specific agency authorities. Doing this will require a cross-disciplinary collaboration, whole-of government effort, and public-private partnerships. All of us are better than any of one of us. To be sure, the SUAS threat is real and there will be no one-size-fits-all answer.

abstract={In light of recent U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) notices, there is a surge in the research and development of the `micro' class sUAS for commercial purposes. Natural gas production and distribution companies in particular are making an effort to develop aerial leak detection methods with sUAS. These efforts require a comprehensive evaluation of sUAS capabilities and the environmental disturbances introduced by the sUAS in order to accurately utilize data collected via onboard in situ methane gas sensors. Though many commercially available sUAS are on the market, the shape and arrangement of any system has significant impact on the aircraft's ability to accurately sense gas leaks. This paper explores using a 3DRobotics Iris+ quadcopter for gas sensing, paying particular attention to propeller disturbances introduced by the sUAS. The paper defines certain operating conditions in which the influence of propellers can be ignored. These results can be used in gas leak applications by examining the overall airflow dynamics of a commercially available rotary sUAS.},

abstract={The safe integration of unmanned aircraft into the national airspace is a topic receiving considerable attention. The US Congress has mandated that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) engage in rulemaking that will allow for civil operation of unmanned aircraft in the national airspace system (NAS), with a release of those rules in 2016*. Preparations are occurring simultaneously for the implementation of the FAA's NextGEN System on 1 January 2020, changing Air Traffic Control (ATC) in the US from one that relies upon radar to a GPS-based system. The introduction of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) into the NAS is expected to be integrated with NextGEN. The availability of small, light ADS-B Out equipment (Autonomous Dependent System-Broadcast) is anticipated to facilitate that, and is discussed. Further, control of UASs will likely adhere to the procedural rules present in today's ATC System and in NextGEN, rules that require a pilot in the loop, making fully autonomous operation forbidden. UASs are therefore expected to employ additional systems and equipment to enhance their sense & avoid capability. Collision avoidance in manned aircraft was improved in 2005 when certain aircraft were required to use the Traffic Collision Avoidance System, TCAS II. The sense & avoid performance of UASs within the NextGEN-controlled airspace should similarly be enhanced by a new system called the Airborne Collision Avoidance System, ACAS. This TCAS replacement will have several variants for various aircraft types including UASs, and it will be capable of accepting data from various types of onboard sensors, making “optimal” use of that data when available. Thus collision avoidance on future aircraft should benefit from enhanced sensing devices such as LIDAR, Mode-S transponder interrogation, IR sensors, and possibly from that provided by the “Due Regard” radar system currently in test on the Predator UAS.},

abstract={Segmentation and analysis of histological images provides a valuable tool to gain insight into the biology and function of microglial cells in health and disease. Common image segmentation methods are not suitable for inhomogeneous histology image analysis and accurate classification of microglial activation states has remained a challenge. In this paper, we introduce an automated image analysis framework capable of efficiently segmenting microglial cells from histology images and analyzing their morphology. The framework makes use of variational methods and the fast-split Bregman algorithm for image denoising and segmentation, and of multifractal analysis for feature extraction to classify microglia by their activation states. Experiments show that the proposed framework is accurate and scalable to large datasets and provides a useful tool for the study of microglial biology.},

abstract={An improved differential evolution (IDE) algorithm-based Elman neural network (ENN) controller is proposed to control a squirrel-cage induction generator (SCIG) system for grid-connected wind power applications. First, the control characteristics of a wind turbine emulator are introduced. Then, an AC/DC converter and a DC/AC inverter are developed to convert the electric power generated by a three-phase SCIG to the grid. Moreover, the dynamic model of the SCIG system is derived for the control of the square of DC-link voltage according to the principle of power balance. Furthermore, in order to improve the transient and steady-state responses of the square of DC-link voltage of the SCIG system, an IDE-based ENN controller is proposed for the control of the SCIG system. In addition, the network structure and the online learning algorithm of the ENN are described in detail. Additionally, according to the different wind speed variations, a lookup table built offline by the dynamic model of the SCIG system using the IDE is provided for the optimisation of the learning rates of ENN. Finally, to verify the control performance, some experimental results are provided to verify the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed SCIG system for grid-connected wind power applications.},

abstract={In this paper, an investigation of Arabic phonemes articulation based the vowel /a:/ is addressed. All the Arabic phonemes are uttered by Malay speakers. This paper aims to discover the pronounciation of Arabic phonemes based /a:/ vowel by Malay subjects. 8 Malay speakers have articulated 224 tokens of Consonant-Vowel syllables. Audacity 2.0.3 software is utilised in order to record all the tokens by using SAMSON C03U USB multi-pattern condenser microphone. The speech analysis software PRAAT is used for extracting formant frequencies. Initially, the tokens are manipulated with Spectral subtraction to denoise the tokens. Subsequently, F1, F2, F3, F4 and F5 are measured for each phoneme. The first two formant frequencies (F1 and F2) are employed to represent the phonemes in the vowels-space. The vowel-space has shown that the phonemes are located in central-mid position. As the subjects are not trained to utter the Arabic phonemes with vowels, the vowel-space shows that the speakers are tended to articulate the vowels as a /a/ vowel in some phonemes and in some other phonemes as a /a:/ vowel.},

pages={1792-1800},
abstract={Continuous conduction mode power factor correction AC-DC converters are widely employed as the front stage in power supplies with medium or high output power. The second-order reactive input power in single-phase systems causes second-order ripple in the DC-link voltage. The speed of voltage regulation is thus limited by the second-order frequency in seeking to achieve low distorted input current. This study presents a fast second-order voltage estimation method, wherein an integrator is used for the estimation of second-order voltage ripple to obtain rapid voltage feedback without ripple and thereby cope with the limitations imposed by the second-order frequency. This approach greatly expands the bandwidth of the voltage control loop beyond the second-order frequency while reducing the total harmonic distortion associated with the input current. This also makes it possible to reduce the DC capacitance to reduce costs. The authors opted for full digital control using a TI F28335 DSP IC, in conjunction with feedback plus feedforward control to facilitate the design of the current loop. A feedback current corrector is used to reduce distortion associated with the input current over a wide load range. The effectiveness of the proposed control method was confirmed with some simulation and experimental results.},

abstract={Air traffic flow has faced a big increase in the last decade, becoming one of the main transportation solutions. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and aeronautical industries are both predicting a growth between 150% and 250% over the next two decades. With this increasing number of aircrafts in the air, airports need also to improve their scheduling strategies to better control the coordination of landing planes. Air Traffic Controllers (ATCO) seek to minimize the waiting time on the aircraft waiting queue. However the ATCO normally use a First Come First Served (FCFS) technique driven by its simplicity. However, it has the disadvantage of offering poor performance when opposed to other strategies. Aiming to characterize and evaluate this performance and compare it with other algorithms, we have tested the application of some scheduling meta-heuristics to this problem, namely Tabu Search (TS) and Simulated Annealing (SA). Experiments show that SA outperforms TS by up to 55% and FCFS by up to 19%. We recommend that using the SA could help managers enhance their decisions over the currently used policies (FCFS) by providing a better scheduling for landing control and saving companies' time and money.},

abstract={Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology's potential relies on advances made by researchers for addressing the technology's security and privacy vulnerabilities, and making data collection and storage in an RFID system safe. Privacy and security are key concerns, as paramount as efficiency and reliability, in raising the confidence of end users towards RFID technologies. This study proposes two complementary lightweight and efficient serverless security protocols in the presence of untrusted RFID readers. The first one is used for mass authentication of RFID tags and supports mutual authentication with key establishment. The second one is an RFID tag search protocol that helps interacting with one specific tag surrounded by a huge number of other tags. The originality of both protocols holds that no shared parameters are required between tags and readers for mutual authentication support, they refer to the same basic material, and they have low resource demands in storage, bandwidth, energy and computation for both RFID readers and tags. Finally, the authors' protocols have been formally verified under the computational model using CryptoVerif tool.},

abstract={Autonomous sender is a program that is able to send log data automatically. The sender program is designed to send log data from kleptoware because it only creates log data without having a program to send it. Autonomous sender uses socket programming so that it can transfer the log data from one computer to another computer. There are two programs needed to support Autonomous sender. The programs are client and server. Client program will be a sender and server program will be a recipient. Main problem of Autonomous Sender is the communication between client and server still point to point, so it only focuses to one targeted computer. Other than that, the log data sent by client program includes all supporting button because kleptoware records any keystrokes typed in the keyboard. Log filter sender is one of the solutions to fix this Autonomous sender main problem. Problem comes when the server program closed and reopened. It needs previous opened client program to be closed and reopened again. The connection between client and server program also can be seen on netstat application. This paper discusses about how to send log data from kleptoware without its recorded supporting button with point to multiple point communication and the connection between client and server program as if it's hidden. Result in this paper shows that server can receive log data from more than one client.},

abstract={In this paper, we analyze and optimize the most time-consuming steps of the SWAP-Assembler, a parallel genome assembler, so that it can scale to a large number of cores for huge genomes with sequencing data ranging from terabyes to petabytes. Performance analysis results show that the most time-consuming steps are input parallelization, k-mer graph construction, and graph simplification (edge merging). For the input parallelization, the input data is divided into virtual fragments with nearly equal size, and the start position and end position of each fragment are automatically separated at the beginning of the reads. In k-mer graph construction, in order to improve the communication efficiency, the message size is kept constant between any two processes by proportionally increasing the number of nucleotides to the number of processes in the input parallelization step for each round. The memory usage is also decreased because only a small part of the input data is processed in each round. With graph simplification, the communication protocol reduces the number of communication loops from four to two loops and decreases the idle communication time. The optimized assembler is denoted SWAP-Assembler 2 (SWAP2). In our experiments using a 1000 Genomes project dataset of 4 terabytes (the largest dataset ever used for assembling) on the supercomputer Mira, the results show that SWAP2 scales to 131,072 cores with an efficiency of 40%. We also compared our work with both the HipMer assembler and the SWAP-Assembler. On the Yanhuang dataset of 300 gigabytes, SWAP2 shows a 3X speedup and 4X better scalability compared with the HipMer assembler and is 45 times faster than the SWAP-Assembler. The SWAP2 software is available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/swapassembler.},

They will be delivering goods and merchandise, serving as mobile hot spots for broadband wireless access, and maintaining surveillance and security of smart cities. However, pervasive use of drones for future smart cities also brings together several technical and societal concerns and challenges that needs to be addressed, including in the areas of cybersecurity, privacy, and public safety. Drones, while can be used for the betterment of the society, can also be used by malicious entities to conduct physical and cyber attacks, and threaten the society. The goal of this survey paper is to review various aspects of drones in future smart cities, relating to cybersecurity, privacy, and public safety. We will also provide representative results on cyber attacks using drones.},

Firstly, a μSAT-3 general description is performed, detailing its sub-systems and on-orbit mission characteristics. The micro-satellite obtains energy through a set of four high-performance solar panels fixed in its lateral sides. In order to sizing the batteries, the energy required during three consecutive orbital periods without receiving solar radiation is estimated. In the battery design it is suitable to use Li-ion cells of small size and divide the total capacity among a greater number of cells to increase design versatility. Regarding battery charge/discharge protocol, it is proposed a battery cycling between voltage values away from the recommended ends, in order to prolong its cycle life. To conclude, a stand-alone Energy Management System is presented, which optimize available energy and avoid critically low levels.},

abstract={This book is written for students, CAD system users and software developers who are interested in geometric continuity—a notion needed in everyday practice of Computer-Aided Design and also a hot subject of research. It contains a description of the classical geometric spline curves and a solid theoretical basis for various constructions of smooth surfaces. Textbooks on computer graphics usually cover the most basic and necessary information about spline curves and surfaces in order to explain simple algorithms. In textbooks on geometric design, one can find more details, more algorithms and more theory. This book teaches how various parts of the theory can be gathered together and turned into constructions of smooth curves and smooth surfaces of arbitrary topology.The mathematical background needed to understand this book is similar to what is necessary to read other textbooks on geometric design; most of it is basic linear algebra and analysis. More advanced mathematical material is introduced using elementary explanations. Reading Geometric Continuity of Curves and Surfaces provides an excellent opportunity to recall and exercise necessary mathematical notions and it may be your next step towards better practice and higher understanding of design principles.},

As we noted, much of the research focuses on what makes UAS different than manned aircraft, and what will be required to permit them to operate, integrated into airspace with other users. There are several key requirements for enabling these operations, but the most troublesome one continues to be how to provide the UAS with a “sense and avoid” capability, to replace the fundamental manned aircraft capability to “see and avoid”, as regulated by most countries and described in the U.S. FAA’s Code of Federal Regulation (14 CFR, Part 91.113). A great deal of effort over the past decade has gone into defining what SAA is, and what the aviation requirements are, for being able to adequately sense and avoid other aircraft in the environment around the UAS.},

abstract={Recent advances in sensing and computing technology has made unmanned aerial vehicles/systems (UAV/UAS) low cost but still increasingly capable of executing complex missions in challenging environments. They have gained popularity in a vast range of civilian applications, including search and rescue, disaster relief, and filming. Recently, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on UAS certifications, indicating that a large number of UAS will be present in the National Airspace System (NAS) in the near future. The NASA UTM project is an effort on enabling low-altitude UAS flights. Big value envisaged by Amazon Prime Air happens only when the drone is able to fly itself tens of miles from the distribution center to people's homes autonomously. One prerequisite for such flights is collision avoidance. Our research aims at drones that travel in class G airspace. This article is an exploration of the drone collision avoidance problem in urban areas. The main contribution is a safety control framework that enables a UAS to perform collision avoidance with manned aircraft during autonomous navigation.},

abstract={A recurrent fuzzy cerebellar model articulation neural network (RFCMANN)-based controller to regulate the active and reactive power of a single-stage three-phase grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system during grid faults is proposed in this study. Since the rapid growth of the amount of the PV systems in recent year has greatly affected the stability of the power system, the grid codes demand the grid-connected PV systems to have the low-voltage ride through (LVRT) capability to help sustaining the stability of power system especially during the grid faults. To satisfy the LVRT requirements and ensure the injected current within the safety value, the active and reactive power commands are calculated by using the current profile of the LVRT grid requirements and the current limit of the inverter. Moreover, the proposed RFCMANN controller uses the signed distance and input space repartition mechanisms to convert the dual-input variables to sole-input variable and repartition the input space to an appropriate quantity. Therefore, the structure and computation complexities of the proposed RFCMANN controller are effectively reduced and make it more practical. Furthermore, varied learning-rate coefficients are designed to guarantee the convergence of the tracking error for the proposed RFCMANN controller.},

abstract={The GNSS has been considered the first choice for providing PNT services to telecommunications, power industry, and transportation applications because of its advantages of wide coverage, high accuracy, and low cost. However, the GNSS is inherently vulnerable to intended or unintended radio interference, and this threat has become more serious because of the easy availability of GNSS jammers on the market. From the robustness and safety perspectives, PNT services should not solely rely on GNSS. APNT solutions must be made available in the case of a GNSS outage. In this article, we investigate APNT solutions for aerial vehicles for which highly standardized PNT services are required to ensure secure and safe transportation, including solutions that have been proposed by the FAA in North America. We discuss the basic principle of each solution and analyze and compare their characteristics under different application scenarios. Finally, we conclude the article by predicting future trends in APNT solutions.},

abstract={A controller using fuzzy probabilistic wavelet neural network (FPWNN) for grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system during grid faults is proposed in this study. The FPWNN controller is developed to control the output reactive and active power of the grid-connected inverter which also considers the ratio of the injected reactive current to meet the low voltage ride through (LVRT) regulations. Moreover, the balance of the active power between the PV panel and the grid-connected inverter during grid faults is controlled by the dc-link bus voltage. Furthermore, to reduce the risk of over-current during LVRT operation, a current limit is predefined for the injection of reactive current. The main contribution of this study is the design of the FPWNN controller for reactive and active power control that provides LVRT operation with power balance under various grid fault conditions. Finally, some experimental tests are realized to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

abstract={A kind of improved method for optimizing the optical chamber of photoelectric smoke detector is introduced in this paper. False alarm of fire detectors could be costly, especially in the field of aviation. Therefore, FAA made a standard that any fire in the cargo compartment of an airplane has to be detected within 60 s. This limitation requires detectors to own extremely high sensitivity and low alarm threshold. However, more false alarms occur because of the nuisance aerosols or something else. Great expertise and in-depth knowledge of several disciplines, such as optics, aerodynamics and material science, are required to design the detectors. By powerful modeling software, complicated optical chamber model of detector can be built within a short time. And optical simulation method by optical simulation software offers a simple solution for optimizing the geometry of optical chamber. In this paper, the effect of internal light sources of optical chamber and ambient light are analyzed applying the new method, and the optimization measures are showed by a simplify procedure. Referring to experimental results, this new proposed method is proved to be feasible.},

If one's new features have a new service associated with it the Service Interface Layer (SIL) will need to expose that service. The SIL will be responsible for routing the right app to the right version of the service.

abstract={RFID technology suffers from a recurring issue: the reader-to-reader collision. Numerous protocols have been proposed to attempt to reduce them, but, remaining reading errors still heavily impact the performances and fairness of dense RFID deployments. This paper introduces a new Distributed Efficient & Fair Anticollision for RFID (DEFAR) protocol. It reduces both monochannel and multichannel collisions as well as interference by a factor of almost 90% in comparison with the best state of the art protocols. The fairness of the medium access among the readers is improved to a 99% level. Such improvements are achieved applying a TDMA-based “serverless” approach and assigning different priorities to readers depending on their behavior over precedent rounds. A distributed reservation phase is organized between readers with at least one winning reader afterwards. Then, multiple reading phases occur within a single frame in order to obtain fast coverage and high throughput. The use of different reader priorities based on reading behaviors of previous frames also contributes to improve both fairness and efficiency. Simulation results show the robustness of the proposed solution in terms of different metrics such collision avoidance, fairness and coverage and in comparison with a centralized literature solution.},

Forecast evaluation results have been applied to the dynamic dispatch of power systems that utilize large-scale wind power. As the starting point in optimizing regional forecast evaluation, this study first gathered fully diverse power forecast evaluation indexes that are based on a traditional index. Second, a comprehensive evaluation method for regional wind power forecast was proposed using principal component analysis and the information entropy calculation method. Finally, the proposed method was used to evaluate the regional wind power forecast. The case study revealed comprehensive evaluations and increased scientific weight allocation. Results confirmed the correctness and rationality of the proposed method, which can serve as a reference for power systems.},

title={Influence of the superposition approximation on calculated effective dose rates from galactic cosmic rays at aerospace-related altitudes},

abstract={The superposition approximation was commonly employed in atmospheric nuclear transport modeling until recent years and is incorporated into flight dose calculation codes such as CARI-6 and EPCARD. The useful altitude range for this approximation is investigated using Monte Carlo transport techniques. CARI-7A simulates atmospheric radiation transport of elements H-Fe using a database of precalculated galactic cosmic radiation showers calculated with MCNPX 2.7.0 and is employed here to investigate the influence of the superposition approximation on effective dose rates, relative to full nuclear transport of galactic cosmic ray primary ions. Superposition is found to produce results less than 10% different from nuclear transport at current commercial and business aviation altitudes while underestimating dose rates at higher altitudes. The underestimate sometimes exceeds 20% at approximately 23 km and exceeds 40% at 50 km. Thus, programs employing this approximation should not be used to estimate doses or dose rates for high-altitude portions of the commercial space and near-space manned flights that are expected to begin soon.},

title={Space weather forecasting with a multimodel ensemble prediction system (MEPS)},
year={2016},
volume={51},

pages={1157-1165},
abstract={The goal of the Multimodel Ensemble Prediction System (MEPS) program is to improve space weather specification and forecasting with ensemble modeling. Space weather can have detrimental effects on a variety of civilian and military systems and operations, and many of the applications pertain to the ionosphere and upper atmosphere. Space weather can affect over-the-horizon radars, HF communications, surveying and navigation systems, surveillance, spacecraft charging, power grids, pipelines, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA's) Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS). Because of its importance, numerous space weather forecasting approaches are being pursued, including those involving empirical, physics-based, and data assimilation models. Clearly, if there are sufficient data, the data assimilation modeling approach is expected to be the most reliable, but different data assimilation models can produce different results. Therefore, like the meteorology community, we created a Multimodel Ensemble Prediction System (MEPS) for the Ionosphere-Thermosphere-Electrodynamics (ITE) system that is based on different data assimilation models. The MEPS ensemble is composed of seven physics-based data assimilation models for the ionosphere, ionosphere-plasmasphere, thermosphere, high-latitude ionosphere-electrodynamics, and middle to low latitude ionosphere-electrodynamics. Hence, multiple data assimilation models can be used to describe each region. A selected storm event that was reconstructed with four different data assimilation models covering the middle and low latitude ionosphere is presented and discussed. In addition, the effect of different data types on the reconstructions is shown.},

abstract={This paper provides recommendations for future development and use of the Flight Information Exchange Model (FIXM) based on experiences gained in preparation for and operation of the Mini Global II (MG II) project demonstration, held in April 2016. The recommendations are intended for those extending the FIXM standard beyond 3.0, and for public and private organizations that implement and distribute Flight Objects (FO) based on the FIXM. The MG II demonstration is one phase of the larger Mini Global project, in which the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the international aviation community cooperatively investigate the capability and utility of sharing flight, weather, and aeronautical data. The demonstration provides a unique opportunity for multiple Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP) and Air Transportation Operators (ATO) to experience how the ICAO Flight and Flow Information for a Collaborative environment (FF-ICE) vision can be leveraged to share key information that impact a flight on a global operational scale. The MG II project incorporated the FIXM 3.0, Weather Exchange Information Model (IWXXM) and Aeronautical Information Exchange Model (AIXM) standards in varying degrees of fidelity, though the recommendations in this report primarily address the FIXM. All stakeholders were invited to submit recommendations, which were then refined by the team to produce the final set of recommendations summarized in this paper. The MG II demonstration expanded on the Phase I demonstrations by upgrading support to FIXM 3.0, and expanding the Global Enterprise Messaging Services that support ANSP's, Flight Operations Centers, and other stakeholders. The deployment of these capabilities in a simulated global environment allows for capability demonstration and testing of FIXM standards and data extensions, demonstrate a capability for international partners to integrate into a global system for data exchange, and evaluate the system's capability to collect flight data for analysis. The recommendations resulting from this experience provide guidance for future development and use of the exchange model as a basis for flight objects.},

abstract={The primary focus of the FAA Collaborative Information Management (CIM) program is on interoperability between US partner agencies and the FAA. Much of the information in the partner agency's systems is operationally sensitive or classified and cannot be released, nor can it be broadcasted unencrypted on any public data links including Mode-S and Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) Extended Squitter (ES). The concept of increased safety and efficiency by use of widely shared operational information between FAA systems and partner agency ground systems relies on greatly enhanced interoperability for information sharing among coalition partners and government agencies, supporting information sharing policies and governances. The purpose of the CIM II program is to inform future decision making regarding controlled, secure information sharing between the partner agencies and the FAA and other Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP) as they develop and implement their respective data communications and information sharing security requirements. This paper describes a phased R&D approach, operational use cases, and a Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) simulation platform for secure exchange of flight information between the FAA System Wide Information Management (SWIM) Security Service and a simulated DoD system in support of interagency operations and standards-based global interoperability. A case study example is presented to discuss the key elements that support the operational scenarios for inter-agency information sharing, primarily of flight information.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration is currently developing the Airborne Collision Avoidance System X (ACAS X), a critical safety system intended to be installed on all large aircraft to prevent mid-air collisions. We identify methods of speeding up the ACAS X algorithms in order to address concerns about ACAS X's ability to meet real-time constraints on practical avionics hardware. The approaches involve state- and grid-point combination, pre- and hierarchical interpolation, memory-locality maximization, and selected use of fixed-point computation. These modifications, which are mathematically equivalent to the original ACAS X design, improved the speed of ACAS X's primary runtime-contributing component by a factor of approximately 7.3 on a 32-bit x86 platform. Along with improved hardware, they enabled the system to meet execution-time objectives in flight testing. The techniques developed are general and potentially applicable to systems that approximate a continuous value function using multilinear interpolation over the values for discrete states and to systems that compute weighted sums of these values across multiple points.},

title={Flexible open architecture for UASs integration into the airspace: Paparazzi autopilot system},
year={2016},
volume={},

pages={1-7},
abstract={Air safety authorities are forced to develop regulations for UAS due to incidents disturbing public safety and demands from UAS operators. Despite numerous studies from the FAA and EASA, none of them decided on a regulation for UASs. The reliability of the flight is considered to be one of the main obstacles for UAVs integration. This is not an easy topic considering the unknowns of the systems, environment and possible failures. We believe the flexibility required for such solutions calls for open architectures. More specifically, this paper shows how the use of the Paparazzi open source auto-pilot system can ease the integration of low altitude UAS. To ensure safety, this integration needs to be achieved through airspace management and UAS reliability. Preliminary airspace designs, e.g. Amazon's, identify different zones depending on the UAS capabilities, population density and altitude. Plus, national rules evolution push to cope with a variety of requirements. Open source and modular architectures are key to adapt to these requirements. From a UTM point of view, Paparazzi provide features to ease congestion management, such as dynamic geofencing, trajectory communication and collision avoidance. Concerning reliability, current regulations focus on flight constraints but might be expected to involve regulations on software and hardware components as well. In such case, the increased cost will be inevitable for the demands of certification. In the Paparazzi software case, parts of the code have been formally proved and stable versions have thousands of flight hours. Such heritage might ease the certification process for smaller companies. On top of its flexibility and reliability, Paparazzi offers a unique set of features, as an open source software, to achieve safe integration of low altitude UAS in the G airspace. To conclude this work, desirable new features and future work are discussed.},

abstract={This paper describes the development of a real-time composite interactive display suite or “dashboard” capability for monitoring and alerting significant National Airspace System (NAS) events. The dashboard is designed to address the operational needs of air traffic managers in gathering data from multiple sources, thus gaining situational awareness of the NAS status. It monitors several system performance areas in real-time and identifies alerting events, pushing to the user relevant information and notifications regarding evolving problems. (“Pushing” information on a display means autonomous presentation - no query or other interrogation by the user is required.) While high-level system alerts are provided, drill-down information is also available for the user to determine whether further actions are warranted. The dashboard also allows the user to customize the alerts for a specific context by setting thresholds. Field evaluation results suggest that the dashboard capability shortens traffic managers' data acquisition time and, since the dashboard capability is a shared web application, it improves common situational awareness on NAS operations. Ongoing research focuses on calibrating alert thresholds for site-specific needs and expanding the selection of performance metrics enabled by System Wide Information Management feeds.},

abstract={This publication describes the collection, processing, and analysis of historical data describing air traffic flow management initiatives. The goal of the work is the definition and exploration of traffic flow management plays, collections of initiatives frequently implemented together. Raw data consisting of advisories issued by the Federal Aviation Administration's Air Traffic Control System Command Center were processed to yield feature data describing initiatives implemented in the New York area. The features used are based on the available scientific literature and documents describing operational air traffic control. Example features describing an initiative include plan time, the difference between when advisories first mention the initiative and when the initiative goes into effect, and cancel time, the difference between when an initiative ends and the latest planned end time according to any relevant advisory. Individual initiatives were categorized according to their features and market basket analysis was applied to see which combinations of initiatives were frequently implemented together. Market basket analysis also provided association rules. For example the implementation, before 14:00 GMT, of a Ground Delay Program for flights destined for LaGuardia Airport greatly increases the chances of there being a Ground Stop at LaGuardia by 16:00 GMT.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are soon to cloud our skies in all areas of the national airspace, uncontrolled as well as controlled. Allowing UAS operation in controlled airspace is the responsibility of the National Navigation Service Providers (ANSP), such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Being able to locate UAS and thus associate it with its respective ground control station(s) is a prerequisite for seamless integration into the National Airspace (NAS). This contribution describes the concept of using the GPS capability of the UAS to provide location-based services to the air traffic control systems, to automate the association with appropriate air traffic control (ATC) communications channels and data links. It is a common expectation now that UAS will soon operate not as individual devices, but as part of a highly networked UAS infrastructure. Small to large UASs will need to be properly addressable from the ANSP's ground control systems such as tower, TRACON, or en-route center. As defined in RTCA DO-320 all UAS pilot-in-control (PIC) are subject to the same regulations as pilots flying aircraft while physically residing on the aircraft, thus need to adhere to commands and directives by air traffic control personnel located in these facilities. Communications links to ATC facilities include data and voice links between air traffic control and the PIC in the UAS ground station. In addition, voice commands need to be broadcasted to all other users (i.e. aircraft, and other UAS - PIC) operating in the same ATC sector. When a UAS transitions the boundary of two sectors the corresponding responsibility changes from one controller to another residing within the same or different ATC facilities. The described Location Based Services (LBS) may be used to dynamically associate the communication service to its responsible ATC facility without PIC intervention. Current communications links between UAS ground control stations (GCS) and ATC are relayed via the UAS itself resulting in the need for a special transceiver on the UAS in addition to the control link transceiver. Especially in the case of small UAS (sUAS) this transceiver constitutes a significant reduction in maximum vehicle payload capacity. This paper proposes a solution that operates without the need for a retransmission transceiver on board the UAS. All communications links between UAS GCS and ATC utilize solely ground based communications assets, networks, and protocols. The LBS concept allows calls to automatically find their way to the correct ATC center, respectively the ATC controller in charge for the associated airspace block. Such a mapping between the user location and the service boundary can be implemented using a Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) system. The LoST system fetches the geographic data representing the boundaries of the airspace sector from its authoritative AIXM database and looks up the unique identifier of the responsible sector, and ATC center. This information is then used to identify the corresponding radio frequency, represented by its EUROCAE ED-137 based identifier, which in turn is used to establish the communications association/link between the PIC and the ATC controller using available Ground communication facilities. We further discuss the dynamic communications link establishment from the ATC controller to the UAS PIC using the LBS. In the UAS network we propose the LBS to be setup as a subscribe/notify service allowing the sharing of additional metadata ahead of a sector handoff. The paper ends with an outlook into the option of a make-before-break automatic link establishment, which may enhanced operational safety and security and could further reduce complexity in the UAS coordination effort for air traffic controllers in the NAS.},

abstract={Unmanned airspace access is a key topic to enable unmanned flights in the U.S. National Airspace System. Above the 400-foot AGL limit, unmanned operations need special care and systems to fly safely and reliably. For autonomous flights to be safe, regular parts of daily, economical operations, designs for both the greater airspace and specific avionics must be built on robust systems design principles. For unmanned systems with a predefined flight plan, it is possible to autonomously and safely fly above 400 feet AGL in manned airspace by interfacing with ADS-B out and under the control of a licensed pilot. Utah State University's AggieAir group has been flying autonomously in this manner for real remote sensing missions, and in this paper, design methodologies for aircraft/avionics systems, ground support equipment, as well as flight logistics and airspace data interfaces are described. Lastly, flight data under FAA Certificates of Authorization (COAs) above 400 feet AGL demonstrate AggieAir's safe operations in manned airspace.},

abstract={NASA is collaborating with the FAA and aviation industry to develop and demonstrate new capabilities that integrate arrival, departure, and surface air-traffic operations. The concept relies on trajectory-based departure scheduling and collaborative decision making to reduce delays and uncertainties in taxi and climb operations. The paper describes the concept and benefit mechanisms aimed at improving flight efficiency and predictability while maintaining or improving operational throughput. The potential impact of the technology is studied and discussed through a quantitative analysis of relevant shortfalls at the site identified for initial deployment and demonstration in 2017: Charlotte-Douglas International Airport. Results from trajectory analysis indicate substantial opportunity to reduce taxi delays for both departures and arrivals by metering departures at the gate in a manner that maximizes throughput while adhering to takeoff restrictions due mostly to airspace constraints. Substantial taxi-out delay reduction is shown for flights subject to departure restrictions stemming from traffic-flow management initiatives. Opportunities to improve the predictability of taxi, takeoff, and climb operations are examined and their potential impact on airline scheduling decisions and air-traffic forecasting is discussed. In addition, the potential to improve throughput with departure scheduling that maximizes use of available runway and airspace capacity is analyzed.},

abstract={Accident statistics cite the flight crew as a causal factor in over 60% of accidents involving transport category airplanes. Yet, a well-trained and well-qualified pilot is acknowledged as the critical center point of aircraft systems safety and an integral safety component of the entire commercial aviation system. No data currently exists that quantifies the contribution of the flight crew in this role. Neither does data exist for how often the flight crew handles non-normal procedures or system failures on a daily basis in the National Airspace System. A pilot-in-the-loop high fidelity motion simulation study was conducted by the NASA Langley Research Center in partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to evaluate the pilot's contribution to flight safety during normal flight and in response to aircraft system failures. Eighteen crews flew various normal and non-normal procedures over a two-day period and their actions were recorded in response to failures. To quantify the human's contribution, crew complement was used as the experiment independent variable in a between-subjects design. Pilot actions and performance when one of the flight crew was impaired were also recorded for comparison against the nominal two-crew operations. This paper details a portion of the results of this study.},

pages={1-9},
abstract={When compared with most other common methods of travel, travel in general aviation aircraft is relatively unsafe. Fortunately, the most frequent causes of fatal general aviation (GA) mishaps could be significantly reduced with very simple autopilot systems. However, such systems can be prohibitively costly due in large part to the expense of validation and verification required to certify them. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), NASA, and the US Air Force have been working to develop alternative certification methods to reduce this cost. In particular, run-time assurance (RTA) methods have recently been gaining momentum as a potential avenue to achieve this goal. This has led researchers from the aforementioned group to propose an RTA system for GA autopilots, which uses the human pilot as the baseline controller and a lesser certified autopilot as the advanced controller. This paper expands on that work by developing a hybrid control model which takes into account the human pilot's variable timing and control ability. Simulation results and a discussion on the impact of these findings are also provided.},

year={2016},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-8},
abstract={The Optimized Route Capability (ORC) concept proposed by the FAA facilitates traffic managers to identify and resolve arrival flight delays caused by bottlenecks formed at arrival meter fixes when there exists imbalance between arrival fixes and runways. ORC makes use of the prediction capability of existing automation tools, monitors the traffic delays based on these predictions, and searches the best reroutes upstream of the meter fixes based on the predictions and estimated arrival schedules when delays are over a predefined threshold. Initial implementation and evaluation of the ORC concept considered only reroutes available at the time arrival congestion was first predicted. This work extends previous work by introducing an additional dimension in reroute options such that ORC can find the best time to reroute and overcome the `first-come-first-reroute' phenomenon. To deal with the enlarged reroute solution space, a genetic algorithm was developed to solve this problem. Experiments were conducted using the same traffic scenario used in previous work, when an arrival rush was created for one of the four arrival meter fixes at George Bush Intercontinental Houston Airport. Results showed the new approach further improved delay savings. The suggested route changes from the new approach were on average 30 minutes later than those using other approaches, and fewer numbers of reroutes were required. Fewer numbers of reroutes reduce operational complexity and later reroutes help decision makers deal with uncertain situations.},

The fire set at Chicago Air Traffic Control facility in September 2014 is a striking and worrisome case where one ill-intentioned individual halted traffic in a facility which caused ripple effects across the National Airspace. This paper analyzes the particular role that the Chicago center plays in the National airspace. Then it provides a detailed analysis of the local and global impact of the fire, through the day of the event and for the next two weeks while the facility remained closed for repairs.

year={2016},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-7},
abstract={Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) is an important decision-support tool for air traffic control (ATC). It is currently being introduced into aircraft cockpits, and will be equally important for remote piloting of unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Unfortunately, numerous studies strongly suggest that manually estimation of closest point of approach (CPA) to heavy weather is a difficult task for pilots, and that current-generation NEXRAD may be intrinsically inadequate for that task. In this study, we begin with an ecological information analysis of the looping NEXRAD format itself, and show that inherent task difficulty is predicted mathematically and by the neural structure of the visual system. Then, to confirm empirically, we develop a mathematical model of an extremely simple “ideal storm” to generate various types of simulated weather cells. A looping NEXRAD-type part-task simulation is created, and 21 general aviation (GA) pilots are tested to measure effects of weather system depth (19 vs. 40 nm), and the opening and closing of gaps at various closure rates between weather cells (-14, -7, 0, 7, 14 kt). For the values tested, weather system depth has no significant effect on eventual CPA from heavy weather (>40 dBZ reflectivity). However, redesign and retesting may be warranted for this variable. In contrast, weather movement clearly and greatly degrades safety. It does not seem to matter if weather movement is as slow as 7 scale kt, nor whether gaps are opening or closing. Any weather movement makes an already hard task harder. We can now say with certainty that current-generation looping NEXRAD is inadequate to manually keep aircraft safely separated from weather. Ecological analysis indicates necessity of adding 30-45 minutes of future-predicted (forecast) weather and a 20 nm range ring to the looping NEXRAD display to enable safe tactical weather avoidance.},

year={2016},
volume={},

pages={1-6},
abstract={The complexity of security systems at airports within the United States - indeed, worldwide - has grown significantly over the years in response to increasing threats and regulatory developments. Initially, each airport developed its own security system without recourse to unified standards. The result was a mixed bag of proprietary systems which were typically over budget, poorly integrated, did not fully meet security requirements, and were both difficult and expensive to maintain. To address this, in the early 90s the ACC (Airports Consultants Council) chaired an RTCA Federal Advisory Committee to develop performance standards for staff access control systems to permit access to security-related areas of an airport. This was followed several years later by TSA's technical guidelines for checked baggage and passenger screening systems. Tying these together, a comprehensive document known within the industry as “The Guidelines”, (The full title is: “Recommended Security Guidelines for Airport Planning, Design and Construction “) was commissioned by TSA in 2006 to replace an earlier 2001 FAA version. This was updated in 2011, and a revision is currently underway for a 4th iteration. The RTCA access control standards are currently in their 7th iteration and the checkpoint and baggage guidelines in their 5th and 6th iteration respectively: demonstrating the need to update such standards regularly, as technology and regulatory requirements change to meet the changing threat. The RTCA access control standard is a substantial document, totaling over 300 pages. The checked baggage guidelines are over 500 pages; the checkpoint guidelines are over 150 pages. Together with “The Guidelines” they comprise a comprehensive set of airport security guidance, frequently referenced throughout the world. This paper reviews how the content of each of these standards was developed: how the developmental activity was funded: how participation by airport professionals contributed, and how the various documents continue to be coordinated. It addresses the issue of uneven technology development cycles and requirements, both within each document and between documents, and how to handle these changes without developing “silos”, as well as providing details of how these challenges were addressed in the access control system standards and the Guidelines.},

abstract={The increasing availability of head-mounted displays (HMDs) for home use motivates the study of the possible effects that adopting this new hardware might have on users. Moreover, while the impact of display type has been studied for different kinds of tasks, it has been scarcely explored in procedural training. Our study considered three different types of displays used by participants for training in aviation safety procedures with a serious game. The three displays were respectively representative of: (i) desktop VR (a standard desktop monitor), (ii) many setups for immersive VR used in the literature (an HMD with narrow field of view and a 3-DOF tracker), and (iii) new setups for immersive home VR (an HMD with wide field of view and 6-DOF tracker). We assessed effects on knowledge gain, and different self-reported measures (self-efficacy, engagement, presence). Unlike previous studies of display type that measured effects only immediately after the VR experience, we considered also a longer time span (2 weeks). Results indicated that the display type played a significant role in engagement and presence. The training benefits (increased knowledge and self-efficacy) were instead obtained, and maintained at two weeks, regardless of the display used. The paper discusses the implications of these results.},

abstract={About half of the population of India depends on agriculture for its livelihood, but its contribution towards the GDP of India is only 14 per cent. One possible reason for this is the lack of adequate crop planning by farmers. There is no system in place to advise farmers what crops to grow. In this paper we present an attempt to predict crop yield and price that a farmer can obtain from his land, by analysing patterns in past data. We make use of a sliding window non-linear regression technique to predict based on different factors affecting agricultural production such as rainfall, temperature, market prices, area of land and past yield of a crop. The analysis is done for several districts of the state of Karnataka, India. Our system intends to suggest the best crop choices for a farmer in order to address the prevailing socio-economic crisis facing many farmers today.},

In addition to discussing the current state of cloud event services, this paper presents two real world applications utilizing these platforms: Lambdefy, a library designed to make traditional web application run effectively in AWS Lambda, and a performant media management service designed by Trek10, capable of resizing thousands of images per second. Furthermore, we discuss how cloud event technologies enable and/or limit these applications, motivate new software design paradigms in a cloud event environment, and highlight compelling use case scenarios and barriers to entry for cloud event services. AWS cloud technologies are exclusively used due to their maturity and the recent release of the other platforms, while Node.js and the Serverless Framework are utilized for deployment and application development.},

abstract={The growth of the nascent UAS industry will be affected by the airspace coordination rules between drones because these rules can impact business profitability. Few analyses have been reported to support design of commercial UAS operations in low-altitude commercial urban airspace. Analysis of minimum horizontal separation is critical for designing safe and efficient UAS delivery systems. In this paper a constructive simulation model is used to analyze and evaluate proposed UAS airspace traffic. A high density of delivery drones could create a bottleneck in a drone-based supply chain very quickly, especially when a high minimum horizontal separation standard is required. This paper proposes a simple idea on how to organize low-altitude UAS traffic, and evaluates the idea using a simulation model. Additional implications and future work needed in relation to UAS-based delivery are also discussed.},

abstract={Data deduplication is a technique that removes redundancy of data on the storage. For cloud storage services, enabling deduplication over encrypted data is of vital importance to achieve both cost savings and keeping data confidentiality simultaneously. Recently proposed solutions are not sufficient because of lacking desired level of security and efficiency. In this paper, we propose SEED, a novel scheme for serverless and efficient encrypted deduplication. Without aid of any additional servers, SEED provides strong confidentiality to the outsourced data. In addition, its non-interactive file encryption with support of lazy encryption greatly reduces latency in file uploading process. Security analysis and performance evaluations show the superior efficiency and effectiveness of SEED for cloud storage services.},

abstract={Our team has performed trade and design studies for the FAA and NOAA of multifunction phased array radar (MPAR) concepts that would combine the functionalities of air traffic control, air surveillance, precision weather observation, and detection of clear air turbulence in a single radar unit. Such a system requires multiple independently operating sectors to perform all functions within the required timeline. Our study identified a pyramidal building with four phased array faces as an attractive geometry, in part because faces are isolated from each other by the structure and corners, permitting reception on one face while simultaneously transmitting on its neighbors. We report here on an initial risk-reduction investigation involving simulations that characterized the achievable face-to-face isolation. We conclude that an MPAR design based on a four-faced pyramidal structure should provide sufficient isolation to allow simultaneous and independent operation and tasking of adjacent faces.},

abstract={A modified microstrip Franklin array antenna (MFAA) is proposed for short-range radar applications in vehicle blind spot information systems (BLIS). It is shown that the radiating performance [i.e., absolute gain value and half-power beamwidth (HPBW) angle] can be improved by increasing the number of radiators in the MFAA structure and assigning appropriate values to the antenna geometry parameters. The MFAA possesses a high absolute gain value (>10 dB), good directivity (HPBW <;20°) in the E-plane, and large-range coverage (HPBW >80°) in the H-plane at an operating frequency of 24 GHz. Moreover, the 10-dB impedance bandwidth of the proposed antenna is around 250 MHz. The MFAA is, thus, an ideal candidate for automotive BLIS applications.},

pages={398-407},
abstract={An intelligent wind power smoothing control using recurrent fuzzy neural network (RFNN) is proposed in this study. First, the modeling of wind power generator and the designed battery energy storage system (BESS) are introduced. The BESS is consisted of a bidirectional interleaved DC/DC converter and a 3-arm 3-level inverter. Then, the network structure of the RFNN and its online learning algorithms are described in detail. Moreover, actual wind data is adopted as the input to the designed wind power generator model. Furthermore, the three-phase output currents of the wind power generator are converted to dq-axis current components. The resulted q-axis current is the input of the RFNN power smoothing control and the output is a gentle wind power curve to achieve the effect of wind power smoothing. The difference of the actual wind power and smoothed power is supplied by the BESS. The minimum energy capacity of the BESS with a small fluctuation of the grid power can be achieved by the RFNN power smoothing control. A digital signal processor (DSP) based BESS is built using two TMS320F28335. From the experimental results of various wind variation sceneries, the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent wind power smoothing control is verified.},

year={2019},
volume={10},
number={1},
pages={100-114},
abstract={Objective measurements of engagement are increasingly sought after by both the media industry and scholar communities to explain what drives people to consume audiovisual contents. However, engagement is a complex construct that, at the psychological level, has been mainly operationalised through indicators of attentional and emotional processes, often overlooking motivational factors. We claim that in the context of news consumption, motivation, operationalised as intrinsic interest for consuming a given content, needs to be factored in together with attentional and emotional processes. The present work provides an objective metric for motivation based on electroencephalographic (EEG) registration of users' neural activity, while they read sets of news pre-classified in terms of their potential interest. We focus on a metric that has been used as an indicator of the degree to which an item or event induces the motivation to approach or escape, the so called frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA). Moreover, in addition to the traditional approach to the analysis of EEG signals, we also introduce a more novel technique based on estimating the entropy of the signals. Results confirm that FAA is indeed a good proxy for objective monitoring of interest in media contents and that entropy analysis, although its interpretation in terms of information processing warrants further investigation, is also sensitive to the manipulation of interest, providing results that complement traditional power spectrum analysis.},

abstract={Template-Based face recognition methods have some limitation for the key points which are used for detection based on the common areas in facial images. One disadvantage of using a template-based method is that not all valuable key points are used. Nodes that are outside the areas that are sought with a template will be overlooked. Some of these key points can provide a more accurate description of the face. Using a method that compares training images against each other rather than a template helps to incorporate all key points of interest for a particular person. By comparing all images against each other, to seek similarity based on distances and repetitive nodes, a node map can be built. This is the foundation for the Comparative Graph Model (CGM). By adjusting a required threshold for repetition and allowable distance among nodes, the algorithm can build a node map solely based on similarity of images across training data.},

abstract={Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) is an effective element of the Safety Risk Management process that augments qualitative methods used in the past. QRA is based on Life Data Analysis [1] and can accurately predict future risk by analyzing the risk without corrective action (uncorrected risk), and then analyzing the risk with specific mitigating actions implemented (corrected risk). Before 2013, there was no uniformity among QRA limits or guidelines in the rotorcraft industry. A benchmarking activity was initiated to document the basis of established QRA risk guidelines in use or recommended by helicopter and engine manufacturers, regulatory authorities, and academia. Benchmarking is a focused process that enables changes that can lead to improvements in products, processes, and services. The anticipated outcome is a comparison of the performance level and best practices of numerous organizations in managing processes and procedures, which can improve the standard of operational excellence. The benchmarking process resulted in the significant milestone of industry/government agreement on uniform definitions and risk guidelines (numerical parameters) for all rotorcraft and for engines installed on multi engine rotorcraft. The new guidelines were adopted by consensus of the group and have been promulgated by incorporation into the FAA Rotorcraft Risk Analysis Handbook for application in the rotary wing aircraft industry. This work can serve as a model for other safety critical fields where standardized Quantitative Risk definitions and guidelines are needed.},

title={Refining fault trees using aviation definitions for consequence severity},
year={2017},
volume={32},
number={3},
pages={4-14},
abstract={Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are being considered for civilian tasks that are time consuming and costly for humans, such as package delivery or surveillance. To derive maximum benefit in these applications, UAS will need to be autonomous rather than remotely operated. Safety rules for autonomous, unoccupied vehicles have yet to be defined. As of February 2015, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) still requires that a UAS operator maintain line of sight with the UAS. As safety standards for autonomous flight emerge, it is expected that a very large number of UAS will take to the skies. Current methods for certification of aviation technologies are rooted in the assumption of manned flight in relatively low-density airspace. The massive number of expected UAS flights and the introduction of increasingly autonomous software autopilots mean that new methods for certifying UAS technologies are warranted. In particular, it is overconservative to assume that failures that could result in the loss of aircraft are necessarily catastrophic, as they would be in the case of a manned aircraft. In order to provide more flexibility in modeling faults, this article introduces methods that tune certification processes to better match FAA standards and to reduce overconservatism that can delay system certification. The basic idea of our work is to update the venerable fault tree, which is at the heart of most certification cases for new aviation technology. A fault tree quantifies risks associated with various failure events and maps the risk to a consequence, which is an unfavorable or hazardous outcome of those fault events. Failure events (also called fault modes) and their associated consequences (also called effects) are typically identified through a process called failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA). Failure modes are then mapped on to the fault tree, where related faults form branches that lead to an undesired consequence. Typically fault trees use a binary state to represent each event: either a fault event has occurred or it has not. The probability of fault occurrence is generally much, much lower than the probability of a nonoccurrence.Whereas conventional fault-tree analysis uses a binary state for each fault, our proposed method is different in that it uses a multilevel state. Introducing multiple severity levels allows for the consequences of events to be classified more precisely, recognizing that not all faults have the same (e.g. catastrophic) consequences. More precise classification of consequences promotes reduced overconservatism, particularly in safety-critical applications, like aviation, where sets of faults are classified by the worst case example from the set. Our work is not the first to generalize fault-tree analysis to use fault states with more than two values. Notably, fuzzy logic has been applied in the past to model multilevel fault states in general and aviation-specific safety systems. The limitation of prior work is that multiple severity levels have been assigned at the level of the fault mode (root cause) rather than at the level of the fault effect (final consequence). For safety analysis, unfortunately, it is not usually clear how to combine faults of different severity levels to determine their effect. Do two low-severity faults occurring simultaneously result in a higher severity consequence? There is no generic answer to this question for aviation applications, because the answer depends on the relationship between the two faults, which must be characterized on a case-by-case basis, for example by using an FMEA. Our proposed method modifies the structure of a traditional fault tree, by shifting focus away from individual faults and to groups of faults, called fault chains. A fault chain is a set of events that together result in an undesired consequence. Because the focus of the method is on consequences (rather than fault events) and because those consequences may take on multiple levels of severity, we call our method consequence severity level (CSL) analysis. The remainder of the article describes CSL analysis and its applications. As a starting point, Section II provides background on aviation severity levels and fault-tree analysis. Section III introduces CSL analysis. Afterward, Section IV presents a UAS case study for a representative application: the use of a UAS for an inspection application. Section V quantifies this application using both conventional and CSL analysis. To conclude, a final section summarizes key technical results and their impact for certification of future UAS.},

abstract={Digital forensics is becoming very challenging because of three main reasons: 1) Highly distributed systems under multiple jurisdictions, 2) Big Data handling and 3) Lack of forensic services, in a cloud computing environment. Due to these obstacles, all the digital investigations are becoming time consuming that makes the solutions more expensive. Cloud computing is capable of handling these challenges, but it lacks an architectural level support for forensic analysis that can meet all the legal requirements. Cloud service providers cannot provide solutions to these challenges by offering forensics tools on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. In this paper, we propose a multi-tier cloud architecture for Forensics-as-a-Service (FaaS) capable of handling the aforementioned challenges and introducing a new infrastructure-level forensic support from cloud providers. We will also discuss the improvement in time and cost efficiency of the overall investigation process.},

Unlike the conventional control strategy, which only considers from the perspective of the distribution system operators (DSOs), the proposed control strategy not only meets the requirements of the DSOs but also maximize the profit for the owner of the PV systems through the profit optimization of reactive power control. Some experimental tests are realized to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. The experimental results show that the profit optimization-based power compensation control strategy increases the profit by 9.81% in overvoltage condition and 3.24% in undervoltage condition.},

year={2017},
volume={},

pages={717-722},
abstract={In the digital world, the size of images is an important challenge when dealing with the storage and transmission requirements. Compression is one of the fundamental techniques to address this problem. A number of transform based compression techniques are discussed in the literature and some are used in practice. In this paper, we propose an edge-based image transformation method which will be used with an entropy encoding technique to greatly reduce image size without loss in content. In the first stage of the proposed transform scheme, the intensity difference of neighboring pixels is calculated in the horizontal or vertical direction depending on the presence of a horizontal or vertical edge. In the second stage, the intensity differences are used to form two matrixes - one containing the absolute intensity difference and the other having the polarity of the differences. Next, Huffman or Arithmetic entropy coding is applied on the generated matrixes. The proposed edge-based transformation and entropy coding (ETEC) scheme is compared to the existing lossless compression techniques: Joint Photographic Experts Group Lossless (JPEG-LS) and Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT). Simulation results show that the proposed ETEC scheme can provide better compression compared to JPEG-LS and SPIHT algorithms for pixelated images that are used for data communication between a computer screen and a camera.},

abstract={Population genetics studies the genetic basis of evolution in a quantitative manner. The Hardy-Weinberg Principle is one of the simplest and most important principles in population genetics. Physical models are generally applied in laboratory of evolution to simulate the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which are often time consuming and error prone. Here, we presented a computer simulation program to model the genetic equilibrium between allele and genotype frequencies of a single gene under Hardy-Weinberg conditions with various selection pressures against dominant and/or recessive allele. The simulation program is based on the simplified all-in-one mathematical model. Results demonstrated that the accuracy of the all-in-one model was comparable to the ones implemented using three individual equations. The all-in-one model provides a more convenient and efficient way with regard to the computer programming. Our computer simulation program will greatly facilitate the biological education to provide the students hands-on experience to investigate the causes of evolutionary changes. In addition, it may also be extended further to simulate the effects of other factors such as genetic mutation and population migration on evolutionary process.},

abstract={The proliferation of small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) has led to a security gap in the defense of strategic installations and at public events. One of the most proven and low-regret methods employed by Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (CUASs) is entanglement of the hostile UAS in a net carried by a hunter UAS. Typically these hunter UASs are controlled by a human pilot. We employ a ground based RADAR system for tracking the target UAS and command the hunter UAS to follow the target UAS, using the Robot Operating System (ROS), the MAVLink protocol, and the PX4 autopilot. This system is fully autonomous, which reduces cost and response time when compared to human-in-the-loop systems. In addition, a novel cylindrical net design is presented. We demonstrate the system's effectiveness through field testing.},

There is also a slew of details to memorize about the FAA's regulations. Question: What special requirements come into play if you operate a drone during civil twilight?

abstract={Systems of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), such as the Amazon Air delivery system, will play a large part in future aerospace development. The design and implementation of these systems will be economically, transportationally, and environmentally important. In this paper, we use agent-based models to analyze the emergent behavior of several types of UAV systems with varying parameters and environments. We find that while increasing the number of UAVs initially has a more-than-linear effect on the reported separation incidents, this effect quickly levels off due to carrying capacity limitations. We also find that while different behaviors (objectives and movement patterns) of UAVs affects the locations of the separation incidents, the number of separation incidents is not strongly influenced by these changes. We then explore the implementation of separation-assurance mechanisms using varying levels of information, and examine effects on the emergent behavior.},

title={Design of a decision support system to reduce net radiative forcing via optimal contrail generation},
year={2017},
volume={},
number={},
pages={330-335},
abstract={With global flight distance projected to increase by a factor of four by 2050, contrail generation is expected to increase by a similar factor. Optimized contrail presence can lead to decreased net radiative forcing (RF): the phenomenon that occurs when heat is trapped within the Earth's atmosphere. RF is projected to increase by 280% by 2050, adding significantly to global warming. A system needs to be developed to utilize the opportunity in aircraft contrail generation optimization; this will help to prevent radiation from entering the Earth's atmosphere and allow outgoing heat to escape. Controptimal is a decision support system for airline dispatch that was created to help address this gap and reduce net radiative forcing. Specifically, a simulation was developed to optimize contrail generation to lower net radiative forcing. Of the nine altitudes analyzed, two proved to lower net RF by at least 20% with the most optimal route flying at FL 330 and decreasing the baseline RF value by 94%. However, RF values were found to decrease further when the system used live weather data. The simulation utilized a network optimization to then conduct a tradeoff between net radiative forcing, fuel burn, and duration of flight. In a specific case study timestamped `2015-08-16 09:00,' Controptimal found an optimal route that began at FL 330 and ascended to FL 380 one hour into the flight. By flying this route, it decreased net RF by 94%, increased fuel burn by 3%, and increased flight time by approximately 4 minutes. This trajectory had a utility of 0.65, followed by an alternatives with the utility of 0.49. The results indicate that contrail presence could be planned to lower the net RF.},

abstract={The reliable use of multi-core platforms for designing safety-critical systems still represents an open challenge. Recently, the FAA [1] has formally expressed its concern towards the use of multi-core systems in avionics. The sharing of hardware resources introduces non-trivial timing dependencies between logically independent components (e.g. cores); additionally, the increase in size of circuitry, memory resources, and transistor density makes these platforms more susceptible to transient memory (soft) errors. This work addresses the problem of memory soft errors and their recovery at an OS/platform level on commercial multi-core systems. Proposed strategy considers the schedulability impact of recovery procedures on hard real-time workloads. Finally, the implementation of a SPM-centric OS with the proposed OS-level strategies was performed by using a commercially available multi-core platform. The design has been validated and evaluated using a combination of synthetic and realistic (EEMBC) benchmarks.},

abstract={Formal methods tools, whose underlying principles are based on mathematics and formal logic, are considered one of the most effective and rigorous means of verifying system properties and assuring the absence of undesirable system behavior. The use of such tools seem to squarely fit the needs of those aiming to develop and certify avionic software as per the DO-178C standard, the set of objectives laid out by FAA to achieve a high level of confidence on the systems. However, our recent work on a NASA-funded research project revealed that there are practical considerations and additional complexities involved in using formal method tools to provide the level of assurance as exemplified by the DO-178C. In this paper we discuss one of the key concerns with formal tools: its soundness - the characteristic of a tool to never permit the verified system property be declared true when it is actually not true. We explored two major classes of formal methods tools - namely model checkers and static analyzers - and observed several threats to their soundness such as tool fallacies and failure modes that could lead to misplaced confidence in the verified system. We present various strategies to mitigate them, including an assurance case framework to verify that potential risks are all mitigated. The intent of this paper is not to discourage but encourage scrupulous use of formal tools to certify critical avionic software by being wary of the subtle but serious issues that may be overlooked.},

year={2017},

abstract={An analysis of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification requirements has revealed a potential error in the temperature correction formula the FAA requires manufacturers to use to process engine cooling data for compliance with Part 23 of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR Part 23). The FAA engine cooling performance temperature correction formula, which predicts the critical temperature of engine components, was quantitatively evaluated using data acquired with a single-engine aircraft powered by a normally aspirated, air-cooled, reciprocating engine. Previous research has failed to analyze the effect ambient air temperature has on oil temperature and has failed to propose a more accurate model for predicting critical cylinder head and oil temperature. Engine cylinder head and oil temperature data were acquired during FAA-defined, cooling-performance climbs performed on three days with different ambient air temperatures. The acquired data revealed the FAA correction formula, when applied to cylinder head temperature, did not correct data to the most critical test condition, potentially leaving certified aircraft vulnerable to overheating. The acquired data showed the FAA correction formula, when applied to oil temperature, worked fairly well. Nonetheless, there was room for improvement. Thus, new temperature correction formulas were developed to predict both critical engine cylinder head and oil temperature for compliance with 14 CFR Part 23. The FAA can evaluate these correction formulas for use in 14 CFR Part 23 to ensure engine cooling performance is properly tested and general aviation aircraft remain safe from overheating.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rations capacity to reduce en route delay, especially those caused by bad weather. This is accomplished via Collaborative Trajectory Options Program (CTOP) which has been recently developed to provide a mechanism for flight operators to communicate their route preferences for each flight via a Trajectory Option Set (TOS), as well as a mechanism for the FAA to assign the best possible route within the set of trajectories in the TOS for a given flight, i.e. the route with the lowest adjusted cost after consideration of system constraints and the requirements of all flights. The routes assigned to an airline depend not only on the TOS's for its own flights but also on the TOS's of all other flights in the CTOP, which are unknown. This paper aims to provide a detailed algorithm for the airline to design its TOS plan which is robust to the uncertainties of its competitors' TOS's. To this purpose, we model the CTOP problem as a Bayesian game, and use Linear Program (LP) to compute the security strategy in the Bayesian game model. This security strategy guarantees the airline an upper bound on the sum of the assigned times. The numerical results demonstrate the robustness of the strategy, which is not achieved by any other tested strategy.},

abstract={Exploding data volumes and acquisition rates, plus ever more complex research processes, place significant strain on research data management processes. It is increasingly common for data to flow through pipelines comprised of dozens of different management, organization, and analysis steps distributed across multiple institutions and storage systems. To alleviate the resulting complexity, we propose a home automation approach to managing data throughout its lifecycle, in which users specify via high-level rules the actions that should be performed on data at different times and locations. To this end, we have developed Ripple, a responsive storage architecture that allows users to express data management tasks via a rules notation. Ripple monitors storage systems for events, evaluates rules, and uses serverless computing techniques to execute actions in response to these events. We evaluate our solution by applying Ripple to the data lifecycles of two real-world projects, in astronomy and light source science, and show that it can automate many mundane and cumbersome data management processes.},

title={Calvin Constrained — A Framework for IoT Applications in Heterogeneous Environments},
year={2017},

pages={1063-1073},
abstract={Calvin is an IoT framework for application development, deployment and execution in heterogeneous environments, that includes clouds, edge resources, and embedded or constrained resources. Inside Calvin, all the distributed resources are viewed as one environment by the application. The framework provides multi-tenancy and simplifies development of IoT applications, which are represented using a dataflow of application components (named actors) and their communication. The idea behind Calvin poses similarity with the serverless architecture and can be seen as Actor as a Service instead of Function as a Service. This makes Calvin very powerful as it does not only scale actors quickly but also provides an easy actor migration capability. In this work, we propose Calvin Constrained, an extension to the Calvin framework to cover resource-constrained devices. Due to limited memory and processing power of embedded devices, the constrained side of the framework can only support a limited subset of the Calvin features. The current implementation of Calvin Constrained supports actors implemented in C as well as Python, where the support for Python actors is enabled by using MicroPython as a statically allocated library, by this we enable the automatic management of state variables and enhance code re-usability. As would be expected, Python-coded actors demand more resources over C-coded ones. We show that the extra resources needed are manageable on current off-the-shelve micro-controller-equipped devices when using the Calvin framework.},

abstract={Cloud federation is an emergent cloud-computing paradigm where partner organisations share data and services hosted on their own cloud platforms. In this context, it is crucial to enforce access control policies that satisfy data protection and privacy requirements of partner organisations. However, due to the distributed nature of cloud federations, the access control system alone does not guarantee that its deployed components cannot be circumvented while processing access requests. In order to promote accountability and reliability of a distributed access control system, we present a decentralised runtime monitoring architecture based on blockchain technology.},

pages={438-446},
abstract={Technology is on the brink of enabling fully autonomous unmanned aircraft system (UAS) operations that can supersede the role of humans in every respect. However, in the United States (U.S.), the regulatory structure for these aircraft remains in its nascent stage. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) current UAS regulations, based on the existing regulatory model applicable to manned aircraft, place the Remote Pilot in Charge (RPIC) as central actor in UAS operations, responsible for safety of flight. Specifically, the FAA requires the RPIC, unaided by technology, to “see and avoid” hazards and mitigate the potential of midair collisions. To the extent that humans become further, or even entirely, removed from UAS flight operations, autonomous UAS flight challenges both the letter and intent of this regulatory scheme The purpose of this paper is to review current FAA regulations in light of anticipated technological advances and propose regulatory suggestions to enable autonomous UAS flights in the U.S. NAS. To do this, Part I summarizes relevant UAS regulations and the rationale behind them. Part II identifies different types of technological advances necessary to mitigate concerns associated with UAS flight safety in general and as applicable to autonomous flight. Part III explores potential regulatory improvements that will be required once sufficient technological mitigation measures exist. Part IV concludes by suggesting a new philosophical paradigm is required, in addition to regulatory and other changes, to truly open up the aperture in the NAS for safe autonomous unmanned flight.},

year={2017},

pages={1722-1730},
abstract={Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have gained considerable private and commercial interest for a variety of jobs and entertainment in the past 10 years. This paper presents the applications of UAS in transportation and structural engineering with emphasis on bridge inspection. A brief but thorough review of UAS applications for State Department of Transportation in the United States is provided. Potential advantages of UAS are acknowledged and the major challenges of using them for bridge inspections are determined. The feasibility of UAS in crack detection, real-time and post-processing, is studied through a case study in controlled conditions. In addition, fatigue crack detection in steel bridges is investigated using three platforms with different mounted cameras. The results of these case studies showed the possibility of using UAS for damage detection in concrete and steel bridges with comparable results with human inspections in real-time. At its best, current technology limits UAS use to an assistive tool for the inspector to perform a bridge inspection faster, cheaper, and without traffic closure. The major challenges for UAS are satisfying restrictive FAA regulations, control issues in a GPS denied environment, pilot expenses and availability, time and cost allocated to tuning, maintenance, post-processing time and acceptance of the collected data by bridge owners. Using UAS, with self-navigation abilities and improving image-processing algorithms to provide results near real-time could provide bridge inspectors with a useful tool to reduce costs and improve inspection quality.},

pages={716-721},
abstract={In this study, a recurrent fuzzy cerebellar model articulation controller (RFCMAC) is proposed to regulate the active and reactive power of a single-stage three-phase grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) system during grid faults. The proposed RFCMAC uses the signed distance and input space repartition mechanisms to convert the dual input variables to sole input variable and repartition the input space to an appropriate quantity. Therefore, the structure and computation complexities of the proposed RFCMAC are lowered and make it more practical. Moreover, in order to satisfy the low-voltage ride through (LVRT) requirements and ensure the injected currents within the safety value, the active and reactive power commands of the controllers are calculated by using the current profile of the LVRT grid requirements and the current limit of the inverter. Furthermore, varied learning-rate coefficients for the online parameters learning are designed to guarantee the convergence of the tracking error for the proposed RFCMAC. Finally, some experimental tests are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

abstract={Contemporary solutions for cloud-supported, edge-data analytics mostly apply analytics techniques in a rigid bottom-up approach, regardless of the data's origin. Typically, data are generated at the edge of the infrastructure and transmitted to the cloud, where traditional data analytics techniques are applied. Currently, developers are forced to resort to ad hoc solutions specifically tailored for the available infrastructure (for example, edge devices) when designing, developing, and operating the data analytics applications. Here, a novel approach implements cloud-supported, real-time data analytics in edge-computing applications. The authors introduce their serverless edge-data analytics platform and application model and discuss their main design requirements and challenges, based on real-life healthcare use case scenarios.},

abstract={Commercial human spaceflight raises numerous medical, legal and ethical considerations with regard to the health and safety of civilian spaceflight participants (SFPs) and commercial crew. New and emerging space transportation companies are proposing a range of commercial suborbital, orbital, interplanetary and point-to-point space transportation. However, the diversity in mission architecture, operation, flight purpose and duration make it difficult to establish a solitary risk assessment or approach towards spaceflight as a homogeneous activity. Even after 50 years in space, there is no denying that a great deal of scientific, technological and medical uncertainty exists with spaceflight. While some hazards have been identified (e.g. acceleration, microgravity, radiation and meteorites), physiological risks and uncertainties for spacefarers remain and are accentuated in opening space access to a wide demographic of individuals with varying levels of fitness and no standardized medical criteria for selection. In addition, the scope of physiological risks spans pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight operations and activities this in turn triggers practical mitigation measures and bioethical-legal duties, such as full disclosure and informed consent. This paper will provide an overview of the applicable laws, underlying values and duties of care intertwined with spaceflight and addresses prominent concerns of medical uncertainty and human risk factors. The aim of which is to assist in establishing a practical, prudent and sustainable framework for human expansion into space.},

abstract={Software testing criteria differ in their effectiveness, the numbers of test cases required, and the processes of test generation. Specific criteria often are compared to random testing, and in some cases, random testing shows a surprisingly high level of effectiveness. One reason that this is the case is that any random test set has a specific level of coverage according to any coverage criterion. Numerical evaluation of coverage levels of random testing according to various coverage criteria is an interesting research task and is important in understanding the relationship between different testing approaches. In this paper, we performed an experimental evaluation of the coverage levels of random testing for two criteria: MC/DC and combinatorial t-way testing. Our experiments showed that, when the number of random test cases increased, a high level of coverage was reached rapidly, both for MC/DC and t-way. However, many more random tests are required to reach 100% coverage. An unexpected result was that there were significant differences in the measurement of partial MC/DC coverage by various tools. The results may be used to select optimal methods for practical testing and develop new testing methods based on the integration of existing approaches.},

We have made a comparative study here of the microfibers of the materials poly vinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT) with the help of COMSOL to understand the suitability of these materials in capturing pulse signals. PZT shows higher electric potential of 21.8 V compared to PVDF which shows 11.6 V for a single microfiber. Therefore here we use a PZT disc sensor in conjunction with Arduino UNO and Arduino IDE to detect the pulse signal and count them. The main objective of this paper is to provide a simple and non-invasive device which while eliminating human errors also allows remote monitoring of patients and at the same time reduces the average time required by the doctor to analyze the patient's health condition.},

abstract={The FAA and EUROCONTROL have a long history of collaboration on air traffic management performance measurement and benchmarking. Every couple of years this results in the joint publication of their report US/Europe Comparison of Air Traffic Management Related Operational Performance. In 2015 they agreed to start taking a closer look at Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) operational practices and performance. Whereas traditional analysis always focused on comparing delay statistics, both groups now wanted to develop a better understanding of each other's application of Traffic Management Initiatives (TMI). The study participants developed an understanding of conceptual and terminology differences between the US and Europe, found data sources that would support benchmarking, and defined a common framework (metrics, indicators, and data dimensions including TMI typology) which enabled them to build a harmonized TMI database containing data covering the full calendar year 2015. The study is still ongoing, and this paper reports on research results as of end 2016. While ATFM actions (i.e. TMIs) in both regions resulted in more or less the same amount of reportable delay (approximately 10 million minutes), we found that there are significant differences in how this delay is “manufactured”: for example, differences were found in terms of the number and type of TMIs used, their duration, TMI cancellation practices, the number of flights affected, the delay production rate of TMIs, etc. This research will help both groups to improve their ability to analyze the effectiveness of ATFM and learn from each other's experience.},

abstract={Air traffic management analysis efforts today are focusing more on trajectory-based operations as a basis for better air traffic control and modernization. Developing proper indicators that correctly characterize these operations has been a key activity for both EUROCONTROL and the FAA. Both organizations are working jointly towards harmonizing the generation of existing metrics to allow for a more analogous comparison between ATM in Europe and in the USA. Harmonization efforts have been challenging due to numerous factors, e.g. missing data or processes that cannot be easily changed due to various system dependencies. One such topic under consideration is vertical flight efficiency, which measures the amount of level flight occurring after the top of descent until an aircraft reaches its destination airport. Various causes of level flight include weather conditions, airport capacity, airspace design and restrictions, and air traffic flow control. A higher level flight value (in terms of the number of level-offs, the total time flown level, or the total level distance) is an indicator of reduced vertical flight efficiency, since a gradual, consistent descent without level-offs from the TOD to the runway is seen as ideal. Benefits of a continuous descent operation or optimized profile descent include better fuel economy, reduced noise, and less pollution. The results of this study show that flights into European airports undergo less level flight on average than flights into US airports: the average level distance per flight is 15.3 NM in Europe and 28.7 NM in the US. Nevertheless, the potential fuel savings are similar: on average 43.5 kg and 43.9 kg of fuel per flight in the US and Europe, respectively. The results of this study are promoted for wider usage by the international ATM performance benchmarking community.},

abstract={Real-time data from ground-based surveillance systems form the basis for current air traffic control procedures in the terminal and en route regions of today's National Airspace (NAS). Current air traffic control procedures, used by controllers, employ tactical methods to manage the separating and sequencing of aircraft. Crossing restrictions are a commonly-used component of tactical control. The use of crossing restrictions causes sub-optimal, level-altitude flight segments for extended distances, which results in excess fuel burn, excess flight duration, and higher airline operating costs. Design and use of uninterrupted climb and descent profiles will recover the lost operating costs. This work employed flight track data and a heuristic algorithm to estimate the magnitude of the lost operation costs. We estimated the impact of level-altitude flights on aircraft operating at airports in the New York City (NYC) area (e.g., EWR, JFK, LGA Airports) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015. In FY2015, 200,000 minutes (3,333 hrs) and 10 million kg (3.3 M gal) fuel were lost due to use of level-altitude procedures for aircraft operations at the NYC-area airports. The study provides estimates of the burden of level-altitude flight sections for aircraft that operated in FY2015 at other major terminal radar approach control (TRACON) facilities in the US: Atlanta (A80), Charlotte (CLT), Chicago (C90), Dallas-Ft Worth (D10), and Northern California (NCT). For the TRACONS studied in this work, the estimated penalty of level-altitude operations is 930,000 minutes (15,500 hrs) and 61 million kg (20 M gal) fuel per year.},

abstract={As UAS technology advances and full-scale operations become feasible and cost effective, the pressure to integrate commercial UAS operations into the National Airspace System (NAS) will drive the need for an architecture that supports seamless interaction between UAS and Air Traffic Control (ATC). This paper considers four high-level architecture alternatives that leverage the FAA NextGen National Voice System (NVS) and identifies the pros and cons of each architecture alternative. The recommended architecture is to have a UAS Gateway to establish connections to the managing Air Traffic Voice Node (AVN) within the airspace via a networked Ground-to-Ground (G/G) connection. Based on this architecture choice, this paper focuses on the UAS Gateway design and functional requirements development.},

abstract={In the current Air Traffic Management (ATM) environment, there is an information access asymmetry between the flight crew and stakeholders on the ground. In many cases, the flight crew, dispatchers, and air traffic manager do not readily have access to updated relevant information to collaborate in determining favorable trajectories for individual flights. This information collaboration between air crew, their dispatchers, and air traffic manager is constrained by current communication capabilities. Air/ground System Wide Information Management (SWIM) concept of operations offers a solution to overcome this communication challenge in the future. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in collaboration with industry stakeholders conceived, planned and executed an Aircraft Access to SWIM (AAtS) demonstration project to determine the feasibility of air-ground communications. The demonstration was conducted in two phases and a series of scenarios of increasing complexity leading up to initial 4-Dimensaional Trajectory (4DT) preferences exchange. Phase 1 demonstrated the ability to share advisory information with the flight crew by utilizing existing commercial data links and hardware in the flight deck. Phase 2 demonstrated the feasibility of bi-directional information exchange between aircraft and ground systems via the SWIM Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The SOA included data management service provider (DMSP), data link provider (DLP), and electronic flight bag (EFB) with software applications. The final 4DT preference exchange scenario demonstration was completed in October 2016. This paper discusses the concepts, assumptions, communication scenarios and results of the AAtS demonstration project. The lessons learned through the AAtS demonstration provide meaningful considerations for guidance on future air-ground information sharing and collaborative decision-making environment.},

abstract={In order to safely and seamlessly integrate UAS into non-segregated airspace, a robust DAA capability needs to be established. The New York Griffiss International Airport Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Test Site is evaluating next-generation UAS ground-based detect and avoid (GBDAA) systems capable of enabling extended UAS beyond line-of-sight (BLOS) operations in airport terminal areas and in transition airspace. GBDAA is an important research area in the current Phase Two of RTCA Special Committee 228 (Minimum UAS Performance Standards), which focuses on civil UAS equipped to operate under IFR flight rules in extended UAS operations in Class D, E, and G, airspace, down to but not including ground operations. The Griffiss UAS Test Site has set up an instrumented test range for air traffic surveillance, extending from the Griffiss airport and its Class D airspace to about 40 NM to the north. The Griffiss range instrumentation system employs multi-sensor fusion using a combination of wide area multilateration, ADS-B, and primary radar to track cooperative and noncooperative air traffic. The system is designed to operate in combination with other air traffic surveillance sensors, including airborne DAA sensors. Griffiss test range instrumentation provides real-time air traffic surveillance, with an ability to incorporate simulated air traffic. The system incorporates a data collection, storage, and analysis capability for building the safety for UAS integration into terminal and transition airspace, and supports live, virtual and constructive simulation in distributed environments (LVC-DE). To understand the system and its uses, it is important to keep sight of reasons for capabilities such as those under development at the Griffiss UAS Test Site. The paper concludes with a description of an example of how multi-sensor fusion in the Griffiss range instrumentation system might be employed to make a safety case of beyond line-of-sight UAS operation in Griffiss test range airspace.},

title={An XML Datalink Message Exchange Model (DMXM) for command and control data sharing},
year={2017},
volume={},

pages={3A2-1-3A2-10},
abstract={ATC services use datalink communication systems such as FANS/ACARS, FAA DCIS and EUROCONTROL DLS/Link2000+. This communication domain, specific for ANSP safety applications, uses dedicated Communication Service Provider (CSP) networks, such as Rockwell Collins (ARINC) and SITA. A need has been identified in the broader aviation community to share the updated status of ATC instructions and clearances with stakeholders other than the ANSPs. This information sharing capability should use the widely-accepted XML data format in order to leverage open publish/subscribe services, and SWIM architecture and governance. Therefore, a standard data model and interface should be defined. This paper explores the creation of a new “XM”, Datalink Messaging Exchange Model (DMXM), for datalink information sharing. Datalink messages and communication functions supported by current FANS 1/A (RTCA DO-258A/EUROCAE ED-100A) and ATN-B2 (RTCA DO-350/EUROCAE ED-228) service standards are identified for inclusion in the model. The relevant ATC communication service (AFN/CM, CPDLC, ADS-C) messages are discussed, and a preliminary XML syntax example is described based. An assessment of the architectures supporting services using this scheme is also introduced. DMXM can enable the use of a common reference data model for datalink information globally, such as through SWIM, integrated with the ATM Information Reference Model (AIRM). Aviation industry data exchange standards (e.g. ACRIS) can also benefit from the use of this information. Targeted users of applications for DMXM include airline dispatchers, pilots, airport operation control centers, and fixed-based operators such as ground handlers. DMXM will provide the aviation community with a standard data model enabling ATC consumer applications using interoperable semantics, thus achieving a higher productivity rate at a lower cost and a shorter time to deployment. Such applications will support common situational awareness for controlled flights and enable collaborative decision making among stakeholders.},

abstract={Rockwell Collins is working closely with government agencies such as the FAA and NASA to extend its service provider portal that offers National Airspace System (NAS) services to range of aircraft operators to include Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) operators. These UAS services, offered in a cloud infrastructure, are referred to as WebUAS™. In this paper, we will present the WebUAS™ architecture — its layers of security, its adaptability to future FAA interfaces, and its organic growth capability as UAS applications expands. We will present its current architecture serving a scaled system of large and small UAS operators and its interfaces to air-traffic control. The paper will also show this current suite of services applied to representative railroad operations — weather, precision navigation, aircraft situation display (ASD), temporary flight restrictions and an authentication engine. One important aspect of WebUAS™ is the separation of computational engines (e.g., authentications engine) from services infrastructure and the ability to use different engines either developed in-house or by 3rdparty vendors for the same purposes. Mapping a specific computational engine to a service package depends on the service package and factors such as minimum cost to maximize capability for the specific operational needs but also use a set of “engine elements” to qualify an engine for a service package. In this paper, we will cover the “engine elements” studied by Rockwell Collins. These engine elements will be applied to the sUAS notification and authentication engine currently addressed by the FAA.},

abstract={On January 14th, 2017, the first SpaceX rocket launch of 10 of Iridium NEXT's satellites generated an exciting milestone towards the global coverage of Aireon's space-based Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) system [1]. ADS-B is a cornerstone technology for the aviation industry that enables significant improvements in aircraft based travel efficiency and safety. Aireon's hosted payload ADS-B receivers have the potential to accelerate and extend the benefits of ADS-B to the entire Air Traffic Management (ATM) community by significantly expanding the boundaries of legacy infrastructure. To evaluate the full extent of this potential, the Aireon team embarked on a series of functional and performance tests on the hosted payloads as well as integration with the operational system. About 2 weeks after the first launch, Aireon began to receive and analyze on orbit ADS-B data from equipped aircraft. This paper describes the key test approaches, results, and analysis that were used to tune and verify Aireon's space-based ADS-B models to estimate the expected end-state ADS-B data service metrics when all 66 operational satellites have reached their mission orbit.},

pages={4B1-1-4B1-7},
abstract={The FAA's recently announced 2016 Performance Based Navigation (PBN) National Airspace System (NAS) Navigation Strategy states that it will retain and expand Distance Measuring Equipment (DME/N) infrastructure to help ensure continued Area Navigation (RNAV) service during Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) outages. The targeted navigation performance using DME/DME in this strategy is RNAV 2.0 in the En Route Domain without requiring Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) and RNAV 1.0 in some large Terminal Areas. It is expected that DME will still play an important role as an alternative RNAV navigation source beyond 2030. It is, therefore, desirable to determine if the performance of DME can be improved to enable PBN of higher navigation accuracy to better meet future air traffic needs. This paper investigates the benefit of a newly developed DME/N pulse using Genetic Algorithms (GA) that can provide much higher ranging accuracy than the conventional Gaussian or Smoothed Concave Polygon (SCP) pulse while meeting the pulse shape requirements in current DME specifications. The primary benefit analysis will compare the achievable DME/DME positioning accuracy with a current DME ground network and compare the DME ground network requirements needed to meet RNAV 0.3 and 92.6 m surveillance positioning accuracy using the conventional Gaussian and the GA-based pulses in selected areas in Conterminous US (CONUS) NAS.},

abstract={In 2016, Harris Inc. designed and implemented the ADS-R Same Link Rebroadcast (SLR) airport service in support of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Surveillance & Broadcast Services program. Airport structures can block reception of direct aircraft to aircraft ADS-B messages between aircraft on an airport surface that need to participate in an application such as Surface Indications and Alerts (SURF IA). In addition, severe multipath interference on direct aircraft to aircraft ADS-B messages may impact the reception of ADS-B messages on the surface. SLR service mitigates such risks by rebroadcasting targets in the same link, that is, 1090 Targets are rebroadcasted on 1090, and UAT targets are rebroadcasted on UAT. In this paper, we describe the SLR service and the data driven approach taken to optimize the design of SLR for airport surface service volumes.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating a concept to improve the quality and timeliness of bird activity information provided by air traffic controllers to pilots. This concept is referred to as the Wildlife Surveillance Concept (WiSC) and uses radar sensors to detect birds in the vicinity of an airport. This paper describes the concept and results from a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) simulation. Previous concept development actIvItIes suggested two primary questions to address through a HITL simulation: 1) what are the impacts of WiSC on a controller's workload?, and 2) How should the information be displayed to the controller? Five Certified Professional Controllers (CPCs) participated in this evaluation using an Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) simulator. We compared a baseline condition to 3 types of WiSC presentation methods (target, text, or supervisor). Measures included multiple indexes of workload, push-to-talk communication counts, and responses to design preference questionnaires. The examination of workload data revealed that WiSC did not increase workload. Instead, the data suggested that there are potential workload savings associated with the implementation of WiSC. Results also showed that WiSC reduced the number of push-to-talk transmissions. Questionnaire responses about WiSC design revealed that most participants preferred the WISC target design, and that most preferred displaying WiSC information on a controller's primary radar display. This paper concludes by discussing the future direction of WiSC research.},

abstract={Unmanned systems are rapidly transforming the entire National Airspace System (NAS). Technological advancements and commercial adoption are pushing the entire industry forward, while regulatory and research efforts are struggling to keep pace. Every aspect of our aviation industry is under consideration, from core technologies to the fundamental definitions of safety and certification. The FAA has moved rapidly to engage the public and put in place an iterative set of commercialuse rules. This process has been exceptionally speedy in the context of historical rulemaking, but these are still just the initial steps. Extensive research is needed, to assess the impacts of this fledgling technology and to ensure a safe and integrated sky. With the growth of unmanned vehicle fleet expected to reach 500,000 vehicles in the next five years, one of the most important elements to be assessed is the impact on wireless communication spectrum. Command and control data links are assumed for each vehicle, but it is unclear what bandwidth and spectrum are needed to support this level of traffic. Understanding capacity and demand issues arising from unmanned aerial vehicle (UA V) activity in specific locations, is a critical component for wireless infrastructure planning and radio frequency (RF) management. As the only unmanned aerial industry forecasting tool that incorporates mission and location data, the innovative UAXPAN system is uniquely suited to assessing the impact of future UA V activity on the wireless communication spectrum. This paper reports on the use of UAXPAN to model localized wireless demand in two specific mission types: quarry mining, and wind farm inspection. UA V activity profiles forecasts are modeled for the period 2016-2036, and those activity forecasts are extended to calculate aggregate bandwidth demand for the given operations. Results of this study provide much-needed insight into the impacts of UA V activity on wireless infrastructure, and provide a path to further modeling of demand on both terrestrial and satellite data links.},

As for flight safety concerns, UAV has much less reliability and less stability comparing to general categories of transportation passenger aircraft. In order to operate UAVs into National Airspace System (NAS), general criteria to show how the UAVs can be operated at a satisfactory level of safety. Based on the UAV development, it is difficult to establish an equivalent level of safety to the general categories of aircraft. Although the flight risk to the ground is relatively low, once any accidents may cause catastrophic casualties to human life. This study uses a simulator to assess the crashing probability density and presents an adaptive set of the clearance region. The UAV specifications by different classifications, such as wing dimension, power plant, fuel capacity and maximum take-off weight, are selected as parameters in consideration for simulation. The crash scenarios of lose power, lose control, spiral drop and fuselage damage are simulated to find the probability of impact to ground objects and human beings. The results can be used to construct a UAV flight mission by combining with a path planning algorithm to keep off potentially high populated areas. The intended use of the tool is discussed and the adaptive clearance region is assessed by a chosen UAV.},

abstract={Manned aircraft that operate in the National Airspace System (NAS) typically undergo certification flight test to ensure they meet a prescribed level of safety—dependent on their category—before they are able to enter service [for example, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) advisory circular (AC) 25-7C is the flight-test guide for certification of transport-category airplanes]. With the integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into the NAS, in the future some type of certification flight test may ultimately be required, however, even lacking such a requirement UAS manufacturers can find value in flight testing UASs using familiar experimental and certification flight-test procedures, the results of which can enhance the safety of the design, the safety of the operation, and/or the efficiency of the operation. In this paper, selected applications of flight-test procedures to the development and operation of UASs are demonstrated using a rotorcraft UAS (a multirotor) and a surrogate for a fixed-wing UAS. The limited, selected flight tests shown here reveal areas for design improvements to potentially enhance safety, provide insights into UAS and manned-aircraft equipage differences, enable potentially safer operational flight profiles, and facilitate more-efficient flight regimes (e.g., optimal flight profiles to maximize a UAS's flight time). These sample studies show promise for the use of conventional flight-test techniques in the design of UAS flight procedures and in the design of the UAS itself.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) long-term vision for full and safe integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS) includes UAS operations in a non-segregated environment where manned and unmanned aircraft share airspace. NAS air traffic services and resources are provided, as needed, with appropriate technology, infrastructure, procedures and policies in place to ensure safe and efficient operations. Significant progress has been made by the FAA to enable small UAS flying below 400 ft. Although most of the current demand for UAS operations is in this low altitude airspace, an increasing number of UAS is expected to need access to higher altitudes where manned aircraft operate. Providing safe and efficient access to airspace for both manned and unmanned aircraft poses significant challenges that may require time to be addressed. These challenges include ensuring reliable command-and-control (C2), and detect-and-avoid (DAA) capabilities; communications with air-traffic-services; airspace design; and supporting automation, flight information, and mobility management. There is also a need for procedures, training, and policies that ensure safety of operations in the integrated environment. This paper provides an overview of these key challenges, discusses potential approaches and opportunities to overcome them, and identifies key trade-offs expected when considering different alternatives with a focus on commercial UAS operations.},

abstract={Rockwell Collins is working closely with government agencies such as the FAA and NASA to extend its service provider portal that offers National Airspace System (NAS) services to range of aircraft operators to include Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) operators. These UAS services, offered in a cloud infrastructure, are referred to as WebUASTM. In this paper, we will present the WebUASTM architecture -its layers of security, its adaptability to future FAA interfaces, and its organic growth capability as UAS applications expands. We will present its current architecture serving a scaled system of large and small UAS operators and its interfaces to air-traffic control. The paper will also show this current suite of services applied to representative railroad operations -weather, precision navigation, aircraft situation display (ASD), temporary flight restrictions and an authentication engine. One important aspect of WebUASTM is the separation of computational engines (e.g., authentications engine) from services infrastructure and the ability to use different engines either developed in-house or by 3rd party vendors for the same purposes. Mapping a specific computational engine to a service package depends on the service package and factors such as minimum cost to maximize capability for the specific operational needs but also use a set of "engine elements" to qualify an engine for a service package. In this paper, we will cover the "engine elements" studied by Rockwell Collins. These engine elements will be applied to the sUAS notification and authentication engine currently addressed by the FAA.},

pages={1-18},
abstract={The FAA's recently announced 2016 Performance Based Navigation (PBN) National Airspace System (NAS) Navigation Strategy states that it will retain and expand Distance Measuring Equipment (DME/N) infrastructure to help ensure continued Area Navigation (RNAV) service during Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) outages. The targeted navigation performance using DME/DME in this strategy is RNAV 2.0 in the En Route Domain without requiring Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) and RNAV 1.0 in some large Terminal Areas. It is expected that DME will still play an important role as an alternative RNAV navigation source beyond 2030. It is, therefore, desirable to determine if the performance of DME can be improved to enable PBN of higher navigation accuracy to better meet future air traffic needs. This paper investigates the benefit of a newly developed DME/N pulse using Genetic Algorithms (GA) that can provide much higher ranging accuracy than the conventional Gaussian or Smoothed Concave Polygon (SCP) pulse while meeting the pulse shape requirements in current DME specifications. The primary benefit analysis will compare the achievable DME/DME positioning accuracy with a current DME ground network and compare the DME ground network requirements needed to meet RNAV 0.3 and 92.6 m surveillance positioning accuracy using the conventional Gaussian and the GA-based pulses in selected areas in Conterminous US (CONUS) NAS.},

abstract={Manned aircraft that operate in the National Airspace System (NAS) typically undergo certification flight test to ensure they meet a prescribed level of safety-dependent on their category-before they are able to enter service [for example, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) advisory circular (AC) 25-7C is the flight-test guide for certification of transport-category airplanes]. With the integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into the NAS, in the future some type of certification flight test may ultimately be required, however, even lacking such a requirement UAS manufacturers can find value in flight testing UASs using familiar experimental and certification flighttest procedures, the results of which can enhance the safety of the design, the safety of the operation, and/or the efficiency of the operation. In this paper, selected applications of flight-test procedures to the development and operation of UASs are demonstrated using a rotorcraft UAS (a multirotor) and a surrogate for a fixed-wing UAS. The limited, selected flight tests shown here reveal areas for design improvements to potentially enhance safety, provide insights into UAS and manned-aircraft equipage differences, enable potentially safer operational flight profiles, and facilitate moreefficient flight regimes (e.g., optimal flight profiles to maximize a UAS's flight time). These sample studies show promise for the use of conventional flight-test techniques in the design of UAS flight procedures and in the design of the UAS itself.},

This is where you control the plane while viewing live video transmitted from an onboard camera to the ground. I quit this hobby when the FAA issued an interpretation of the law that forbade flying model planes this way. In a nutshell, it defined a model aircraft as something you kept in sight at all times. Having video goggles or other visual aids (besides eyeglasses) blocked your view, so it wasn't okay to fly with them under model aircraft rules. . But the FAA opened the door to FPV again last year with its Small UAS Rule, which allows this kind of flying if you are certified as a remote pilot, as I've recently become. So I've been dusting off my FPV gear and exploring what's new in the hobby.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel control method for multimodule photovoltaic microinverter (MI). The proposed MI employs a two-stage topology with active-clamped current-fed push-pull converter cascaded with a full-bridge inverter. This system can operate in grid-connected mode to feed power to the grid with a programmable power factor. This system can also operate in line-interactive mode, i.e., share load power without feeding power to the grid. In the event of grid power failure, the MI can operate in a standalone mode to supply uninterruptible power to the load. This paper presents a multiloop control scheme with power programmable capability for achieving the above multiple functions. In addition, the proposed control scheme embedded a multimodule parallel capability that multiple MI modules can be paralleled to enlarge the capacity with autonomous control in all operation modes. Finally, three 250-W MI modules are adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method in simulations as well as experiments.},

pages={1-6},
abstract={Advantages of the recurrent fuzzy cerebellar model articulation controller (RFCMAC) include local generalization capability, fast learning, simplicity of computation, and capability of solving dynamic problem. Normally, the tracking error and the derivative of the tracking error are fed into the controller to perform the control of command tracking. Firstly, in this study, a two-dimensional RFCMAC (2D-RFCMAC) is adopted to approach the command control of the active and reactive power for performing the low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) operation of a single-stage photovoltaic (PV) system. However, the 2D-RFCMAC requires larger memory due to the memory size increases exponentially with the number of inputs. Thus, a one-dimensional RFCMAC (1D-RFCMAC) with signed distance and input space repartition mechanisms is proposed to replace the 2D-RFCMAC to perform the LVRT operation of the single-stage PV system. The reduced input dimension and computation complexity make the 1D-RFCMAC more practical. Moreover, some experimental tests are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. The results show that the control performance of the proposed 1D-RFCMAC is not only slightly better than 2D-RFCMAC but also has lower memory size and computation complexity.},

abstract={Lambda architecture is a novel event-driven serverless paradigm that allows companies to build scalable and reliable enterprise applications. As an attractive alternative to traditional service oriented architecture (SOA), Lambda architecture can be used in many use cases including BI tools, in-memory graph databases, OLAP, and streaming data processing. In practice, an important aim of Lambda's service providers is devising an efficient way to co-locate multiple Lambda functions with different attributes into a set of available computing resources. However, previous studies showed that consolidated workloads can compete fiercely for shared resources, resulting in severe performance variability/degradation. This paper proposes a resource allocation mechanism for a Lambda platform based on the model predictive control framework. Performance evaluation is carried out by comparing the proposed solution with multiple resource allocation heuristics, namely enhanced versions of spread and binpack, and best-effort approaches. Results confirm that the proposed controller increases the overall resource utilization by 37% on average and achieves a significant improvement in preventing QoS violation incidents compared to others.},

abstract={Securely processing data in the cloud is still a difficult problem, even with homomorphic encryption and other privacy preserving schemes. Hardware solutions provide additional layers of security and greater performance over their software alternatives. However by definition the cloud should be flexible and adaptive, often viewed as abstracting services from products. By creating services reliant on custom hardware, the core essence of the cloud is lost. FPGAs bridge this gap between software and hardware with programmable logic, allowing the cloud to remain abstract. FPGA as a Service (FaaS) has been proposed for a greener cloud, but not for secure data processing. This paper explores the possibility of Secure FaaS in the cloud for privacy preserving data processing, describes the technologies required, identifies use cases, and highlights potential challenges.},

abstract={Cloud federation is a novel concept that has been drawing attention from research and industry. However, there is a lack of solid proposal that can be widely adopted in practice to guarantee adequate governance of federations, especially in the Public Sector contexts due to legal requirements. In this paper, we propose an innovative governance approach that ensures distributed and democratic control in cloud federations. Starting from FaaS, a recent cloud federation proposal, we propose a blockchain infrastructure for the federation registry that implements the proposed governance approach.},

abstract={A Cloud federation is a collaboration of organizations sharing data hosted on their private cloud infrastructures in order to exploit a common business opportunity. However, the adoption of cloud federations is hindered by member organizations' concerns on sharing their data with potentially competing organizations. For cloud federations to be viable, federated organizations' privacy concerns should be alleviated by providing mechanisms that allow organizations to control which users from other federated organizations can access which data. We propose the architecture of a novel identity and access management system part of FaaS, a cloud federation service developed by the H2020 SUNFISH project. Our system allows federated organizations to enforce attribute-based access control policies on their data in a privacy-preserving fashion. Users are granted access to federated data when their identity attributes match the policies, but without revealing their attributes in clear. The architecture relies on two novel technologies, blockchain and Intel SGX hardware platform to guarantee integrity of the policy evaluation process.},

abstract={In this paper, an approach has been developed to determine the list of aero-engine life-limited parts (ELLPs) precisely with different number and types for service management plan. The recent researches about the ELLPs have been investigated including airworthiness regulations and life management plan based on the airworthiness requirements and advisory circulars related to the ELLPs from Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). Take a certain type of fan rotor as an example, the flowchart and approach to determine the ELLPs have been established through three steps. Each part of the fan rotor has been checked and listed in the collection of the ELLPs, in which the primary failure level is the catastrophic and the failure mechanism corresponds to the low cycle fatigue (LCF). The list of ELLPs in this type of aero-engine has been obtained using the present approach. This approach provides the guidance to enhance the safe life through maintaining the attributes required for engineering plan by determining the life-limited parts with other types of aero engine.},

abstract={A novel maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) method based on power perturbation for a field-oriented control interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive system is proposed in this study. The proposed MTPA method, which is parameter independent and can improve the motor operation at both start-up and low speed, is designed based on the power perturbation by using the signal injection in the current angle. Moreover, the influence of current and voltage harmonics to the MTPA control can be eliminated effectively. Furthermore, to enhance the robustness of the control system, an online tuning scheme for an integral-proportional controller using a new wavelet fuzzy neural network with disturbance torque feedforward control is developed where the disturbance torque is obtained from an improved disturbance torque observer. Finally, some experimental results using an IPMSM drive system based on a low-price digital signal processor are presented. From the experimental results, the proposed control approach can guarantee the control performance of the speed loop, even under a cyclic fluctuating load.},

The goal is to enhance the fulfillment of the good governance principles, namely: visionary, effectiveness-efficiency, openness-transparency and accountability. The overall service system quality is expected to improve with the adherence to the principles. The method used is an extension of the Service Engineering Framework, with a specifically chosen SOA Methodology; the Thomas Erl's Mainstream SOA Methodology (MSOAM). The produced result shows an increase of good governance score by 12.51%, measured between the initial assessment survey and after the demonstration of proposed financial services system.

abstract={Additional digital layer is an important aspect in the Smart grid architecture. We gather the data using this layer and the whole grid is controlled accordingly. Energy cost can be estimated and the demand can be predicted. Estimation of health issues of electrical equipment can be done from the control room by gathering the data from remote locations. In the case of computer-aided digital relay model if we choose the pilot relay action by remote data then that would be the good application of this digital layer. In this paper, we have suggested an alternative method- to gather and analyze the remote data using the serverless cloud computing framework. The prime objective is to design a cheaper and technically easier simulation strategy with this new framework. At the end, we have tried to create a mathematical model to estimate the cost and quality of service. The system is simulated using MATLAB, Amazon Web Service (AWS) products and a batch program.},

year={2017},
volume={},

pages={1-4},
abstract={The aviation industry has many aircraft in use after more than twenty years of life with some aircraft achieving the fifty years of life milestone. The avionics aboard the older aircraft are based on circuitry elements with diminishing or no manufacturing sources. Entire families of integrated circuits are no longer available, such as the early Intel processors and peripherals, 54C series CMOS logic and LH0075/LH0076 voltage references. Obsolescence replacement programs must preserve the investment in formal FAA certification for affordability, which makes work-alike solutions technically attractive. The voltage reference replacement is fairly straightforward using a newer series reference. The logic replacement is less straightforward because even though the logic diagram may be a duplicate, modern logic operates at reduced voltage levels. Processors and programmable peripherals present additional challenges, as the code running on the processors represents a large secondary investment multiplying the cost of replacement. The documentation for older systems may be poor quality, including illegible drawings, missing data and incompatible data formats. The high cost of overcoming these obstacles to redesign led to a search for cost reductions in other areas. Re-use of an automated test station (ATS) and development of test program set (TPS) assets proved to be a cost reduction opportunity in the manufacturing, integration, acceptance and maintenance of the replacement avionics. Past practice has been to design a unique separate test solution at each level of test, incurring significant non-recurring cost. Selecting an existing maintenance level ATS for all levels of test avoids the significant non-recurring costs of specialized ATS at each level. Developing electronic box and circuit card TPSs compatible across all test phases reduces cost over the life of the redesigned avionics. The paper is a case study of a recent avionics obsolescence replacement program, which included the test solution used. An existing ATS, single electronic box level TPS and single circuit card TPS per circuit card type were used for all phases of test. Integrating the legacy avionics on the TPSs ensured functional equivalence would be achieved with the new avionic assets. The unique fault universe for each level of test will be covered, like fabrication defects for manufacturing, design defects for integration, fabrication & infant mortality defects for acceptance, and component failures for maintenance.},

abstract={Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using non-uniform linear arrays is considered. We focus on the so called "fully augmentable arrays" (FAAs) with full set of covariance lags. In FAAs, the number of covariance lags is usually larger than the number of sensors in the array. Thus, with FAAs more sources than the number of sensors can be identified. Existing DOA estimation algorithms for FAAs are based on the assumption of uncorrelated sources. In this paper, based on compressed sensing, we present a DOA estimation algorithm for FAAs without assuming uncorrelated sources. The proposed algorithm is based on the newly introduced gridless SPARse ROW-norm reconstruction (SPARROW) formulation for the joint sparse reconstruction from multiple measurement vectors. By numerical experiments, we show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in the presence of correlated signals or small number of snapshots. Moreover, using simulations, the behavior of the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) for the case of correlated source is demonstrated and it is shown that, when the number of sources is larger than the number of sensors, the CRB for FAAs approaches zero at infinitely large signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) only if the sources are fully correlated.},

abstract={We describe the use of model-driven development for safety assurance of a pioneering NASA flight operation involving a fleet of small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) flying beyond visual line of sight. The central idea is to develop a safety architecture that provides the basis for risk assessment and visualization within a safety case, the formal justification of acceptable safety required by the aviation regulatory authority. A safety architecture is composed from a collection of bow tie diagrams (BTDs), a practical approach to manage safety risk by linking the identified hazards to the appropriate mitigation measures. The safety justification for a given unmanned aircraft system (UAS) operation can have many related BTDs. In practice, however, each BTD is independently developed, which poses challenges with respect to incremental development, maintaining consistency across different safety artifacts when changes occur, and in extracting and presenting stakeholder specific information relevant for decision making. We show how a safety architecture reconciles the various BTDs of a system, and, collectively, provide an overarching picture of system safety, by considering them as views of a unified model. We also show how it enables model-driven development of BTDs, replete with validations, transformations, and a range of views. Our approach, which we have implemented in our toolset, AdvoCATE, is illustrated with a running example drawn from a real UAS safety case. The models and some of the innovations described here were instrumental in successfully obtaining regulatory flight approval.},

abstract={Future reduced crew operations or even single pilot operations for commercial airline and on-demand mobility applications are an active area of research. These changes would reduce the human element and thus, threaten the precept that “a well-trained and well-qualified pilot is the critical center point of aircraft systems safety and an integral safety component of the entire commercial aviation system.” NASA recently completed a pilot-in-the-loop high fidelity motion simulation study in partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) attempting to quantify the pilot's contribution to flight safety during normal flight and in response to aircraft system failures. Crew complement was used as the experiment independent variable in a between-subjects design. These data show significant increases in workload for single pilot operations, compared to two-crew, with subjective assessments of safety and performance being significantly degraded as well. Nonetheless, in all cases, the pilots were able to overcome the failure mode effects in all crew configurations.

abstract={Accident statistics cite flight crew error in over 60% of accidents involving transport category aircraft. Yet, a well-trained and well-qualified pilot is acknowledged as the critical center point of aircraft systems safety and an integral safety component of the entire commercial aviation system. No data currently exists that quantifies the contribution of the flight crew in this role. Neither does data exist for how often the flight crew handles non-normal procedures or system failures on a daily basis in the National Airspace System. A pilot-in-the-loop high fidelity motion simulation study was conducted by the NASA Langley Research Center in partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to evaluate the pilot's contribution to flight safety during normal flight and in response to aircraft system failures. Eighteen crews flew various normal and non-normal procedures over a two-day period and their actions were recorded in response to failures. To quantify the human's contribution, crew complement was used as the experiment independent variable in a between-subjects design. Pilot actions and performance when one of the flight crew was unavailable were also recorded for comparison against the nominal two-crew operations. This paper details diversion decisions, perceived safety of flight, workload, time to complete pertinent checklists, and approach and landing results while dealing with a complete loss of electrical generators. Loss of electrical power requires pilots to complete the flight without automation support of autopilots, flight directors, or auto throttles. For reduced crew complements, the additional workload and perceived safety of flight was considered unacceptable.},

abstract={Accident statistics cite the flight crew as a causal factor in over 60% of large transport aircraft fatal accidents. Yet, a well-trained and well-qualified pilot is acknowledged as the critical center point of aircraft systems safety and an integral safety component of the entire commercial aviation system. The latter statement, while generally accepted, cannot be verified because little or no quantitative data exists on how and how many accidents/incidents are averted by crew actions. A joint NASA/FAA high-fidelity motion-base simulation experiment specifically addressed this void by collecting data to quantify the human (pilot) contribution to safety-of-flight and the methods they use in today's National Airspace System. A human-in-the-loop test was conducted using the FAA's Oklahoma City Flight Simulation Branch Level D-certified B-737-800 simulator to evaluate the pilot's contribution to safety-of-flight during routine air carrier flight operations and in response to aircraft system failures. These data are fundamental to and critical for the design and development of future increasingly autonomous systems that can better support the human in the cockpit. Eighteen U.S. airline crews flew various normal and non-normal procedures over a two-day period and their actions were recorded in response to failures. To quantify the human's contribution to safety of flight, crew complement was used as the experiment independent variable in a between-subjects design. Pilot actions and performance during single pilot and reduced crew operations were measured for comparison against the normal two-crew complement during normal and non-normal situations. This paper details the crew's actions, including decision-making, and responses while dealing with a drive shaft failure - one of 6 non-normal events that were simulated in this experiment.},

abstract={When developing new automation capabilities, analysts must consider how those capabilities affect the air traffic controller's tasks. At the request of the FAA, MITRE examined how a future set of automation enhancements for the TRACON domain will impact air traffic controller workflow, task times, and mental effort. The MITRE team assessed these operational impacts to the controller through task modeling with a tool called Cogulator. We modeled tasks representing operations with today's tools (as-is) and use of the TRACON automation enhancements (to-be). Our modeling results show how a controller's workflow changes when the controller chooses to use the TRACON automation enhancements. These workflow changes include electronic communication in place of voice communication, as well as earlier notification of separation and spacing conflicts. Our results also demonstrate other impacts of using the automation enhancements: shorter task times associated with each capability and mental effort levels that decrease or stay the same.},

title={Wide-scale integration of unmanned aircraft systems into the National Airspace System through a fault tree analysis approach},
year={2017},
volume={},

pages={1-10},
abstract={The introduction of Title 14 of the code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) Part 107 by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has begun widespread integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS). Manned and unmanned aircraft will be occupying the same volumes of airspace for which the safety levels must be upheld. In order to preserve these levels of safety, a thorough scientific and systematic integration approach must be implemented. Until this point, aircraft certifications for operation in the NAS have been based upon the assumption that a pilot flies the aircraft from an in-fuselage cockpit. To maintain equivalency for unmanned aircraft operations, these implicit assumptions must be identified and translated to an unmanned aircraft context. A formal system safety assessment approach was initiated with a fault tree analysis to identify assumptions contingent on the pilot's presence inside the aircraft and areas of weakness in operational equivalency. A UAS fault tree framework is proposed as a translation from the accepted manned aircraft fault tree model. This framework is applicable to UAS of different classes, sizes, and operational modes. A database of international UAS accidents and incidents occurring 2001-2016 was used to categorize reported failure events and develop trend data identifying areas of concern for integration. This database was categorized by the UAS Fault Tree Framework Level 1 Subsystems and ICAO/CAST Aviation Occurrences. The most commonly occurring Aviation Occurrence was System/Component Failure (Non-Power plant). Trend data indicates areas of integration and reliability concern including the Aircraft/System and Flight Crew/Human Factors Level 1 Subsystem categories. The common ICAO/CAST Aviation Occurrences identified were different than those for fatal accidents in manned commercial aviation operations. High system reliability and formal aircraft system certification are needed to achieve equivalent levels of safety between manned and unmanned operations in the NAS. Additionally, pilot/crew training requirements for unmanned operations must be developed independently of existing manned aircraft training standards and must be evaluated to ensure effective systematic risk mitigation to the appropriate levels of safety.},

title={Small unmanned aircraft system (SUAS) automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) like surveillance concept of operations: A path forward for small UAS surveillance},
year={2017},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-10},
abstract={Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS) are becoming more common in the National Airspace System (NAS). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) forecasts SUAS growth to be over 2.69 million by 2020 [1]. The majority of these operations are expected to occur below 400 feet above ground level. Due to the clutter of SUAS operations, a surveillance system will likely be required to help SUAS operators avoid collisions with other aircraft and eventually, to help integrate these operations into the National Airspace. A concept for such a SUAS surveillance service is presented in this paper. A surveillance solution concept is proposed that leverages Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) and Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks to provide ADS-B like services to SUAS. Using both networks enables surveillance coverage at low altitude that is able to be integrated with existing FAA surveillance services. This paper describes the need for a new SUAS surveillance service, a set of use cases for that service, and proposes a conceptual system solution, referred to as `Vigilant'. The Vigilant proposal includes the use of a new ADS-B frequency for air-to-air communications, a concept for leveraging the LTE network, and new surveillance message content specific to SUAS operations. Future research needs are discussed to expand on the concept, furthering the capability of the system to support SUAS operations. The Vigilant SUAS surveillance communication concept will enable the safe and efficient integration of SUAS into the NAS.},

title={Safety analysis paradigm for UAS: Development and use of a common architecture and fault tree model},
year={2017},
volume={},

pages={1-10},
abstract={Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS, a.k.a., drones) are a compelling technology with numerous possibilities for highly productive new airspace operations. Safety of operators and bystanders is of paramount concern, and a common, accepted, safety methodology is a pressing need to enable widespread adoption of UAS. This paper provides a methodology for safety analyses that can be conducted for multiple applications using common models and a suggested standardized architecture for small UAS. To date, in the US, safety analyses have been done on an individualized, custom basis, mainly in support of waivers for specific, limited UAS operations. For example, safety analyses have been conducted in the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Pathfinder Program for use of drones in three focus areas: beyond visual line of sight for infrastructure inspections, extended visual line of sight in rural areas, and flight over people. In addition, approximately 400 waivers have been granted for multiple individual applicants [1]. The waiver process is highly specific to an individual applicant's operation and a special safety analysis must be conducted for each waiver request. This is an inefficient use of resources for both the FAA and industry. It would be more efficient if a common model for UAS safety analysis could be employed that was adaptable to varied applications. An important subclass of UAS operations which currently requires waivers are operations termed Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS). BVLOS operations allow for UAS flight operations which are out of the visual line of sight of the UAS operator. BVLOS will allow multiple economically beneficial applications, for example, infrastructure inspection and agriculture. Our approach seeks to begin providing an adaptable framework for analyses, focusing on Beyond Visual Line of Sight operations, that allows rapid assurance of operational safety. The benefits of this approach are twofold: first, in the near term, the workload involved in applying for waivers, both for the FAA and for applicants, would be significantly reduced, and second, the approach can be used to inform industry standards on key system requirements. This would give industry an important start in the development of common standards for equipment requirements, as is typically done in standards bodies such as RTCA. To provide a UAS reference model, a common small UAS architecture is proposed to conduct analyses across UAS platforms and operations. The architecture enables the safety model's inputs to be adapted to target UAS platforms and operational scenarios. This approach allows for large scale simulations that can analyze the impact of various vehicle performance configurations in differing operational scenarios. This paper also provides a fault-tree analysis model that is customizable to specific operations, and shows some initial results that help provide insights into tradeoffs and potential requirements. The paper explores these tradeoffs in the context of previous analysis conducted by Patterson et al. [2] which identifies a top-level requirement for “Loss of Controlled Flight for any Reason.” The fault-tree analysis helps to identify the various root causes (basic events) of the model's system failure condition (top event) - loss of controlled flight of the UAS vehicle. The attractiveness of the model is that it is easily adaptable to different operations, safety guidelines, reliability requirements, equipment standards, etc. The paper demonstrates a sensitivity analysis to assess the varying impact of the basic events on system failure at different error levels. The fault-tree model and sensitivity analysis results, along with the accompanying common architecture, together provide a flexible approach to UAS safety analyses.},

abstract={This paper investigates opportunities and challenges when implementing Trajectory-based Taxi Operations at airports dependent on the availability of Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) processes in Europe and the U.S. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) jointly developed a concept of operations for Trajectory-based Taxi Operations. An essential prerequisite of this concept is that adequate information sharing processes referring to collaborative decision making are available. CDM concepts like Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) and Surface Collaborative Decision Making (S-CDM) were introduced by EUROCONTROL and the FAA, respectively, to improve the use of the available airport infrastructure. Both concepts aim to improve the efficiency of airport operations by reducing congestion on the airport surface, improving the traffic flow efficiency, and reducing uncertainties during airport operations. Both concepts are compared in this paper with a focus on taxi operations and the impact on the stakeholders. This paper provides an answer to the question which opportunities and challenges might be faced with the implementation of Trajectory-based Taxi Operations at airports with A-CDM and S-CDM. Especially from the perspective of involved stakeholders, the operational objectives that are partially contradicting to each other are discussed. It is shown that both CDM processes generally leverage the implementation of Trajectory-based Taxi Operations. However, there are still existing gaps that are identified and addressed in this paper. They based on current research in the area of airport surface traffic optimization towards Trajectory-based Taxi Operations.},

volume={},

pages={1-9},
abstract={As demands increase to use unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for a broad spectrum of commercial applications, regulatory authorities are examining how to safely integrate them without compromising safety or disrupting traditional airspace operations. For small UAS, several operational rules have been established; e.g., do not operate beyond visual line-of-sight, do not fly within live miles of a commercial airport, do not fly above 400 ft above ground level. Enforcing these rules is challenging for UAS, as evidenced by the number of incident reports received by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This paper reviews the development of an onboard system - Safeguard - designed to monitor and enforce conformance to a set of operational rules defined prior to flight (e.g., geospatial stay-out or stay-in regions, speed limits, and altitude constraints). Unlike typical geofencing or geo-limitation functions, Safeguard operates independently of the off-the-shelf UAS autopilot and is designed in a way that can be realized by a small set of verifiable functions to simplify compliance with existing standards for safety-critical systems (e.g. for spacecraft and manned commercial transportation aircraft systems). A framework is described that decouples the system from any other devices on the UAS as well as introduces complementary positioning source(s) for applications that require integrity and availability beyond what can be provided by the Global Positioning System (GPS). This paper summarizes the progress and test results for Safeguard research and development since presentation of the design concept at the 35th DASC (2016). Significant accomplishments include completion of software verification and validation in accordance with NASA standards for spacecraft systems (to Class B), development of improved hardware prototypes, development of a simulation platform that allows for hardware-in-the-loop testing and fast-time Monte Carlo evaluations, and flight testing on multiple air vehicles.

abstract={Providing improved efficiency in the terminal environment around high-capacity airports, Established on RNP leverages Required Navigation Performance technology to safely allow reduced aircraft-to-aircraft separation during curved simultaneous approaches. As one element in a comprehensive safety analysis, this paper describes the methodology and results used to estimate the mid-air collision risk when at least one aircraft leaves the intended approach path by inadvertently selecting an unintended flight procedure. The analysis considers three possible cases where an aircraft could be put at risk of collision during such an event: one where the trailing aircraft flying to the intended runway may be put at risk; a second where an aircraft flying to the incorrectly selected runway is put at risk; and, a third case, which only occurs when more than three parallel runways are available, where an aircraft flying to a runway between the intended runway and the incorrectly selected runway is put at risk of collision. The analysis concludes that all three cases could pose significant risk if not appropriately mitigated with controller monitoring and procedure design, but the third case is the most severe.},

title={Models of maximum flows in airspace sectors in the presence of multiple constraints},
year={2017},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-8},
abstract={Recently, the ATM community has made important progress in collaborative trajectory management through the introduction of a new FAA traffic management initiative called a Collaborative Trajectory Options Program (CTOP). FAA can use CTOPs to manage air traffic under multiple constraints (manifested as flow constrained areas or FCAs) in the system, and it allows flight operators to indicate their preferences for routing and delay options. CTOPs also permit better management of the overall trajectory of flights by considering both routing and departure delay options simultaneously. However, adoption of CTOPs in airspace has been hampered by many factors that include challenges in how to identify constrained areas and how to set rates for the FCAs. Decision support tools (DST) providing assistance would be particularly helpful in effective use of CTOPs. Such tools would need models of demand and capacity in the presence of multiple constraints. This study examines different approaches to using historical data to create and validate models of aircraft counts in sectors and other airspace regions in the presence of multiple constraints. A challenge in creating an empirical model of aircraft counts under multiple constraints is a lack of sufficient historical data that captures diverse situations involving combinations of multiple constraints especially those with severe weather. The approach taken here to deal with this is two-fold. First, we create a generalized sector model encompassing multiple sectors rather than individual sectors in order to increase the amount of data used for creating the model by an order of magnitude. Secondly, we decompose the problem so that the amount of data needed is reduced. This involves creating a baseline demand model plus a separate weather constrained sector count reduction model and then composing these into a single integrated model. A nominal demand model is a sector aircraft count model (gdem) in the presence of clear local weather. This defines the flow as a function of weather constraints in neighboring regions, airport constraints and weather in locations that can cause re-routes to a location of interest. A weather constrained flow reduction model (fwx-red) is a model of reduction in baseline counts as a function of local weather. Because the number of independent variables associated with each of the two decomposed models is smaller than that with a single model, need for amount of data is reduced. Finally, a composite model that combines these two can be represented as fwx-red (gdem(e), l) where e represents non-local constraints and l represents local weather. The approaches studied to developing these models are divided into three categories: (1) Point estimation models (2) Empirical models (3) Theoretical models. Errors in predictions of these different types of models have been estimated. In situations when there is abundant data, point estimation models tend to be very accurate. Also, empirical models do better than theoretical models when there is sufficient data available. The biggest benefit of theoretical models is their general applicability in wider range situations once the degree of accuracy of these has been established. Quantile regression methods are used to create models of different quantiles of aircraft counts as well as probability distribution functions. Such models can be used in CTOP DSTs in providing assistance with recommendations about CTOP parameters and in supporting what-if reasoning about consequences of potential decisions.},

abstract={Air route traffic control centers (ARTCCs) operated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) are responsible for efficiently and safely managing United States en route air traffic at altitudes of 18,000 feet and above. To achieve the FAA's mission, the ARTCC's human air traffic controllers monitor air traffic and ensure aircraft safety within partitioned airspace, called sectors, located in each ARTCC's boundaries. In order to achieve this, air traffic controllers must resolve potential conflicts that are identified through methods including manual inspection through looking at their display, or air traffic automated systems alerts. A standard en route conflict occurs if two aircraft travel within five nautical miles in the horizontal plane, while simultaneously flying within 1000 feet in the vertical plane. The controllers request pilots make changes to their intended trajectories to prevent a risk of violating separation distances. The FAA collects and archives the air traffic automation data corresponding to the predicted conflict events and information about the aircraft during their flight, such as: ground speed, vertical phase, horizontal phase, minimum separation distances and time postings. This paper describes algorithms for cataloging (detect and characterize) aircraft conflict resolutions, utilizing the data that is archived by air traffic automated systems. The automated systems only alert the air traffic controllers of potential conflicts. It is the human air traffic controllers that either perform a conflict resolution or determine if the alert is false. Our algorithms identify the maneuvers cleared by the air traffic controllers that occurred. We verify and validate our algorithms using real air traffic data. Characteristics of the traffic scenarios we used are not factors impacting our algorithms.},

abstract={It is widely acknowledged that the proliferation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) may lead to serious concerns regarding avionics safety, particularly when end-users are not adhering to air safety regulations. There are, however, domains in which UAVs may help to increase the safety of airplanes and the management of flights and airport resources that often require substantial human resources. For instance, Paris Charles de Gaulle airport (CDG) has more than 7,000 staff and supports 30,000 direct jobs for more than 60 million passengers per year (as of 2016). Indeed, these new systems can be used beneficially for several purposes, even in sensitive areas like airports. Among the considered applications are those that suggest using UAVs to enhance safety of on-ground airplanes; for instance, by collecting (once the aircraft has landed) data recorded by different systems during the flight (like the sensors of the Aircraft Data Networks - ADN) or by examining the state of airplane structure. In this paper, our proposal is to use UAVs, under the control of the airport authorities, to inventory and track various tagged assets, such as luggage, supplies required for the flights, and maintenance tools. The aim of our proposal is to make airport management systems more efficient for operations requiring inventory and tracking, along with increasing safety (sensitive assets such as refueling tanks, or sensitive pieces of luggage can be tracked), thus raising financial profit.},

abstract={Dealing with Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components is a daily business for avionic system manufacturers. They are necessary ingredients for hardware designs, but are not built in accordance with the avionics consensus standard DO-254 for Airborne Electronic Hardware (AEH) design. Especially for complex COTS hardware components used in safety critical AEH, like Microcontroller Units (MCUs), additional assurance activities have to be performed. All of them together shall form a convincing confident, that the hardware is safe in its intended operation environment. The focus of DO-254 is one approach called Design Assurance (DA). Its aim is to reduce design errors by adherence of prescribed process objectives for the entire design life cycle. The effort for certain COTS assurance activities could be reduced if it is possible to demonstrate, that the COTS design process is based on similar effective design process guidelines to minimize desgin errors. In the last years, semiconductor manufacturers released safety MCUs in compliance to the ISO 26262 standard, dedicated for the development of functional safe automotive systems. These products are COTS components in the sense of avionics, but they are also developed according to a process that focuses on reduction of design errors. In this paper an evaluation is performed to figure out if the ISO 26262 prescribes a similar DA approach as the DO-254, in order to reduce the COTS assurance effort for coming avionic systems.},

abstract={Recent advances in rotorcraft design, multi-rotor vehicle control, miniaturization of hardware, sensing, and battery technologies have enabled cheap, practical design of micro air vehicles (MAVs) for civilian and hobby applications. In parallel, several applications are being envisioned that bring together networks of MAVs to accomplish large tasks by coordinating with each other. Despite these advancements, and new FAA rules governing their use, it is still very challenging to experiment with multiple networked MAVs. To address this problem, we are engaged in a multi-year effort to develop an open software/hardware platform called the University at Buffalo's Airborne Networking and Communications testbed (UB-ANC1), and an associated emulation environment called the UB-ANC Emulator. Our goal is to design, implement, and test MAV networking applications in simulation, and provide seamless transition to deployment. In our prior work on the UB-ANC Emulator, we considered a simple network simulation in which nodes can communicate with each other if they are within a given range. However, this does not accurately reflect the performance of a MAV network where communication links are subject to interference and packet losses, and protocols at the data link, network, and transport layers have a significant influence on network throughput, latency, and reliability. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we integrate the open-source discrete-event network simulator ns-3 into the UB-ANC Emulator. We demonstrate through link-level and end-to-end measurements how the UB-ANC Emulator can be used to holistically evaluate MAV networking applications with accurate modeling of mobility, control, wireless channel characteristics, and network protocols using ns-3.},

volume={},

pages={438-443},
abstract={AWS Lambda (Amazon Web Services) is the most popular serverless architecture provided by Amazon. It currently supports three platforms: JavaScript, Python, and Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM could be the most complicate platform among the three as there are many languages that target the JVM platform besides Java. In addition, the complex hierarchy of dependencies, versioning, and the class loader are major issues that could cause conflict in a project. Deployment in the context of a serverless architecture means deployment as a function that represents a single service rather than as an application that is comprised of many services. AWS Lambda requires a deployment artifact to be self-contained which means all resources and dependencies must be packaged into a single jar file, and this file could be larger than AWS Lambda's allowable limit. Developers usually use build tool plugins to make self-contained artifacts, and those tools are generally unaware of what class and resource files a function needs. As a result, the artifact is not optimized. This paper demonstrates that optimization of an artifact can in general improve its resource usage and runtime performance. This paper also reports the result of an anecdotal experiment regarding the overhead of calling functions remotely in order to support design decisions in the development of AWS Lambda.},

abstract={An experimental research on display principle of Head Up display (HUD) failure alert design was conducted on the basis of aircraft failure alert relevant regulations in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advisory Circular (AC) 25.1322. An experimental research including HUD visual coding techniques (outline boxes, flashing with different frequencies) and binary channel alerts (visual and aural channel) was performed based on the static display interface of monochrome HUD, which was drawn by GL studio software. Subjective evaluation, signal detection assessment based on sensitivity and likelihood ratio, behavioral performance, as well as physiological measures indexed by electrocatdiogram (ECG), electrodermal Activity (EDA) data, and respiration data were recorded and analyzed for the statistical method. Results claimed that an immediate alert can be induced by the outline boxes and flashing in visual coding. As to physiological responses, flashing with low frequency had a significant lower HR than flashing with high frequency; the RRCV and SDNN (the time domain index of heart rate variability) of Group 2 (60HZ, 80DB) in Topic 2 was obviously lower than the others, which indicated a workload effect to the alerts. The alert with binary channels was evidently better than the alert with visual channel individually, and the better one was Group 2 (60HZ, 80DB) in Topic 2 in the experiment. Our study can provide a certain technical support for the design of HUD failure alert interface in ergonomics.},

A “dumb pipes” approach, where services communicate through a simple message queue, facilitated this evolution with relatively little disruption to the rest of the system.

abstract={As data is having an increasingly relevant role in di erent business fields, ensuring integrity has become fundamental. Modern databases rely on transaction history written on redo logs to allow for data restore. However, if redo logs are (maliciously) forged, data can actually be lost or altered. Due its strong data integrity guarantees, blockchain technology can be employed to ensure log integrity, but its current performance limitations hinder actual exploitations.In previous work, we proposed a layered blockchain-based architecture for distributed (federated) database redo logs: a fast first layer blockchain, anchored to a secure second layer blockchain, based on proof-of-work to achieve strong integrity. Here, we present an implementation and an experimental evaluation of a prototype of that architecture, which employs a total consensus algorithm on the first layer blockchain. Finally, to improve availability and scalability, we refine our solution by investigating, respectively, a Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus and a Distributed Hash Table solution to shard the first layer blockchain ledger among available nodes.},

However, there is now an emerging consensus around key ideas and informal applications design patterns that have been adopted and used in many successful cloud applications. In this introduction, we will describe these cloud-native concepts and illustrate them with examples. We will also look at the technical trends that may give us an idea about the future of cloud applications. We begin by discussing the basic properties that many cloud-native apps have in common. Once we have characterized them, we can then describe how these properties emerge from the technical design patterns.},

title={A Model Predictive Controller for Managing QoS Enforcements and Microarchitecture-Level Interferences in a Lambda Platform},
year={2018},
volume={29},
number={7},
pages={1442-1455},
abstract={Lambda paradigm, also known as Function as a Service (FaaS), is a novel event-driven concept that allows companies to build scalable and reliable enterprise applications in an off-premise computing data-center as a serverless solution. In practice, however, an important goal for the service provider of a Lambda platform is to devise an efficient way to consolidate multiple Lambda functions in a single host. While the majority of existing resource management solutions use only operating-system level metrics (e.g., average utilization of computing and I/O resources) to allocate the available resources among the submitted workloads in a balanced way, a resource allocation schema that is oblivious to the issue of shared-resource contention can result in a significant performance variability and degradation within the entire platform. This paper proposes a predictive controller scheme that dynamically allocates resources in a Lambda platform. This scheme uses a prediction tool to estimate the future rate of every event stream and takes into account the quality of service enforcements requested by the owner of each Lambda function. This is formulated as an optimization problem where a set of cost functions are introduced (i) to reduce the total QoS violation incidents; (ii) to keep the CPU utilization level within an accepted range; and (iii) to avoid the fierce contention among collocated applications for obtaining shared resources. Performance evaluation is carried out by comparing the proposed solution with an enhanced interference-aware version of three well-known heuristics, namely spread, binpack (the two native clustering solutions employed by Docker Swarm) and best-effort resource allocation schema. Experimental results show that the proposed controller improves the overall performance (in terms of reducing the end-to-end response time) by 14.9 percent on average compared to the best result of the other heuristics. The proposed solution also increases the overall CPU utilization by 18 percent on average (for lightweight workloads), while achieves an average 87 percent (maximum 146 percent) improvement in preventing QoS violation incidents.},

The intelligent IoT tag contains 4 types of sensors; three dimensional accelerometer, thermometer and humidity sensor. Accelerometers acquire the three dimensional vibrations through internal motor system motion, other sensors measure environmental conditions. In our FaaS (Factory as a Service) system also have non-network supported legacy devices; 3D printer, Vapor and CNC machines which contain motor based moving system.

abstract={Fish-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a business-to-business model offering monitoring services performed by a biomimetic fishlike drone. FaaS considers environmental, scientific, and business concerns when addressing marine monitoring, providing alternative methodology while preserving ocean resources. The key to FaaS is the ability to provide a low-cost, low-maintenance, high-endurance, agile sensor platform. This article analyzes the design criteria for such a vehicle and the challenges presented. The current state of AUVs (both traditional and biomimetic) is briefly reviewed to put these design challenges in perspective. The solution offered by Aquaai Corporation to address this challenge is the bio-inspired vehicle (BIV). In robotics, biomimicry emulates designs found in nature to solve technological challenges - such as the tuna fish for swim speed and cuttlefish for rapid maneuverability. The key for success is that the design of the BIV incorporates biomimicry with aerial drone technology and advanced manufacturing techniques to achieve the low-cost point necessary to proliferate throughout the water space.},

abstract={In line with cloud computing emergence as the dominant enterprise computing paradigm, our conceptualization of the cloud computing reference architecture and service construction has also evolved. For example, to address the need for cost reduction and rapid provisioning, virtualization has moved beyond hardware to containers. More recently, serverless computing or Function-as-a-Service has been presented as a means to introduce further cost-efficiencies, reduce configuration and management overheads, and rapidly increase an application's ability to speed up, scale up and scale down in the cloud. The potential of this new computation model is reflected in the introduction of serverless computing platforms by the main hyperscale cloud service providers. This paper provides an overview and multi-level feature analysis of seven enterprise serverless computing platforms. It reviews extant research on these platforms and identifies the emergence of AWS Lambda as a de facto base platform for research on enterprise serverless cloud computing. The paper concludes with a summary of avenues for further research.},

volume={6},

pages={4308-4320},
abstract={The lack of sufficient spectral resources in many alternative positioning, navigation, and timing (APNT) systems for aviation has led to the problem of mutual interferences. Building APNT system with the cognitive radio and frequency-hopping (FH) techniques can resolve above problem, however, the main challenge is to achieve a long and high-precision range with high-speed FH signals. In this paper, we propose a novel ranging method called time-frequency matrix ranging (TFMR), which is based on the FH signals. Using the TFMR method, we built a jam-resistant APNT system to meet the accuracy and coverage requirements of aviation. We employed a dual-tone signal for the TFMR to estimate the pseudoranges between the ground stations and the aircrafts. One major challenge we faced was that what was good for ranging accuracy was bad for coverage. For example, increasing the dual-tone interval can improve the ranging accuracy; however, this led to a decrease in the unambiguous measurement range (UMR). To overcome this challenge, we employed different dual-tone intervals in different hops of the frequencyhopping signal. Finally, we formed a time-frequency matrix, so that a high UMR could be guaranteed without any harmful consequences on the ranging accuracy in the middle to high levels of the signal-to-noise ratio. The Cramér-Rao lower bound of TFMR is derived as the benchmark of the method. Using extensive simulations, we investigated the ranging performance of the TFMR method. The simulation results showed that the proposed TFMR could satisfy the APNT requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration.},

This article focuses on the design of integrated structure and the intrinsically safe circuit with digital signal output. The maximum operating current is less than 50mA, which meet the requirements of current stipulated by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in 2008.

abstract={Cloud computing providers offer a variety of pricing models, complicating the client decision, as no single model is the cheapest in all scenarios. In addition, small to medium-sized organizations frequently lack personnel that can navigate the intricacies of each pricing model, and as a result, end up opting for a sub-optimal strategy, leading to overpaying for computing resources or not being able to meet performance goals. In this paper, we: (1) present the results of a study that shows that, in Ecuador, a considerable percentage of companies choose conservative pricing strategies, (2) present a case study that shows that the conservative pricing strategy is suboptimal under certain workloads, and (3) propose a set of models, a tool and a process that can be used by tenants to properly plan and budget their cloud computing costs. Our tool is based on M (t)/M/* queuing theory models and is easy to configure and use. Note that, even though we are motivated by our study of adoption of cloud computing technologies in Ecuador, our tool and process are widely applicable and not restricted to the Ecuadorian context.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is funding and encouraging new concepts for improving air traffic flow management (TFM) decision-making. The resulting automation capabilities will need to be operationally integrated into the existing air traffic management (ATM) system. Understanding how a new capability will interact with existing system components is challenging because of the range of possible real-world situations, which must be handled by the ATM system. Although there are fast-time traffic simulation tools available for modeling the impact of TFM actions, they are often developed as stand-alone tools, which are not extensible or flexible to work in concert with other advanced TFM capabilities for conducting integration studies or quantifying benefits. To address this gap, we have built a fast-time, distributed simulation platform integrating state-of-the-art traffic simulator and allows the plug-in of advanced TFM prototypes - or other experimental capabilities that already exist - so their interactions can be studied. In this paper, we discuss the requirements and the necessary components for building this platform, which requires an architecture that is flexible enough to support many different configurations of modeling tools and applications. We then use a TFM integration case study to demonstrate the utility of the platform. We show, with only minor effort, a proposed TFM prototype can be plugged into the platform and its benefits can be evaluated.},

abstract={The demand of the industry for high performance electric motors has significantly increased nowadays. This has boosted the usage of permanent magnet brushless synchronous motors (BLSM) in many applications where the accuracy and performance requirements are high. Further improvement of the BLSM drive systems performance can be achieved by providing them with adaptive control capabilities. The relative complexity of adaptive control schemes and algorithms and the computational load that they impose have prevented until recently their practical implementation into the industrial servo systems. In this investigation, a neuro-adaptive control scheme where the rule for parameter adaptation is designed by taking into account the variable structure control (VSC) concepts and Lyapunov stability, is proposed and embedded into an inexpensive, available on the market, position control system for brushless synchronous servomotors. The experimental tests have been carried on using compact and flexible, based on open hardware and software concept, dual-axis motion controllers PMC201/PMC202 manufactured by the PicoMotion Inc. The applied software has been written using the Motion Control Framework software platform, provided together with the above controllers. The results obtained with the proposed neuro-adaptive control scheme have been compared to those obtained using the originally built into the system PI controller. The experiments have shown that the implemented advanced adaptive control approach is practically viable and can be embedded into the industrial motion control systems which will lead to their improved performance.},

The types of learning behavior we extracted were determined by analyzing the usage of course site in Sakai. To display students' learning behavior intuitively to instructors, we designed trace charts to visualize the data. We used the LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) methodology to analyze students' behavior in whole course duration. Machine learning model GBDT was chosen as the classifier in our model to detect well-performed students.

abstract={Adverse weather can reduce airport capacity. When the number of arriving aircraft exceeds this reduced capacity, flights can get delayed. A Ground Delay Program (GDP) is a strategy by which aircraft landing slots can be redistributed so that the flights are delayed on the ground itself and not in the air. This increases safety, reduces the fuel consumption and hence the operating costs for airlines. In this paper, we present six algorithms that perform this slot reassignment. These algorithms differ in the extent to which slots can get re-arranged in real-time and the amount of information that the airlines must reveal to the central planner during the implementation. These two features of the algorithm are called as stability and privacy respectively. The efficiency of these six algorithms, measured in terms of the expected delay cost for flights, is compared using operational data for La Guardia Airport in New York. A two-step Receding Horizon Static (2-step RHS) model is shown to be a good compromise based on present expectations of privacy and stability in the system.},

pages={2078-2082},
abstract={This paper suggests a simple method for decomposing several chaotic systems into a harmonic oscillator provided with a nonlinear feedback. The chaotic oscillators analyzed include low order, non-delayed and continuous time models. The proposed decomposition method consists in three steps. First, the chaotic system is modelled as a combination of a linear component with a nonlinear feedback. Second, the linear part is modified so that it is transformed into a conventional harmonic oscillator with pole placement means. The position of the poles is set arbitrarily to guarantee its stability while maintaining the desired properties of sustained oscillation frequency. Finally, the feedback system is designed to keep the original nonlinearities while cancelling the changes introduced in the linear part. This, in turn, retrieves the initial chaotic dynamics. Essentially this procedure allows switching from chaotic to harmonic dynamics -or vice-versa-as required by application demands. The idea is presented in a generic form so that it can be applied to a variety of fields. The initial motivation was set in the context of secure chaotic communications. The decomposition procedure has been demonstrated and validated through numerical simulation of various well-known chaotic oscillators such as Duffing, Lorenz and Chua.},

abstract={Pets in real life and pets in virtual worlds play two different roles in a human's life. To date, the relationships between humans and virtual pets, especially in virtual reality environments (VRE), remain uninvestigated and relatively unexploited in designing virtual pet games. This paper examines the perceptions, motivations and expectations of people who play games involving pets, and how emotional connection with real pets affect their expectation for pets in VREs. To investigate this, we analyzed data collected from (i) an online survey of 774 people and (ii) observations and interviews with 30 people who played VR pet games in a lab study. Differences in perception, motivation and expectation in virtual reality pet games were found between players who have pets or do not. These findings deepen our understanding of the formation of emotion connections in VREs and provide a basis for studying individual differences in emotion in virtual pet games.},

pages={1-5},
abstract={Recently, the incentive to improve transformer utilization driven by increasing power demands and financial pressure of new equipment investment is more and more strong. Existing study focus on overloading constraints like hottest-spot temperature (HST) and failure rate, but the transformer operation risk is rarely considered in overload strategy making. This paper firstly proposes an operation risk analytical method of oil-immersed transformers, to evaluate the transformer loss, power grid enterprise loss and society loss during overloading. Considering the operation risk, a two-stage overload strategy is presented. In stage 1, the security constraints including HST, failure rate and the proposed risk are discussed to obtain a preliminary strategy; in stage 2, benefits and costs of overloading are calculated to analyze the economy of strategies between preliminary strategy and full-loading, and the profit-optimal strategy will be chosen as the final strategy. The validity of proposed overload strategy and influence of transformer service time on strategy making is demonstrated through case study.},

abstract={Transformer life assessment and failure diagnostics have always been important problems for electric utility companies/Ambient temperature and load profile are the main factors which affect aging of the transforiner insulation, and consequently, the transformer lifetime. The IEEE Std. C57.91-1995 provides a model for calculating the transformer loss of life based on ambient temperature and transformer's loading. In this paper, this standard is used to develop a data-driven static model for hourly estimation of the transformer loss of life. Among various machine learning methods for developing this static model, the Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is selected. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed ANFIS method compared with other relevant machine learning based methods to solve this problem.},

year={2017},
volume={},
number={},
pages={35-40},
abstract={A difficult issue that faces the operators of aging aircraft is to assure the regulators that their aircraft is structurally sound. From a structural perspective, aircrafts are complex and susceptible to fatigue damage due to the usage of aluminium and the proliferation of rivets. Multiple site fatigue damage (MSD) refers to the presence of multiple fatigue cracks in the same structural element. These cracks may interact with each other, increasing their collective growth rates, which may result in a rapid degradation of the structural integrity of the structure. This paper describes this group's experiences related to the usage of 1-D convolutional neural networks (1D ConvNets), in conjunction to fracture mechanics-borne material fatigue damage models in the task of modeling the damage progression of an aircraft lap joint with multiple cracks, subjected to a specific range of possible load sequences. This multivariate regression task is a proxy to the crucial task of estimating the point at which a structural element's residual strength levels have been lowered enough that it cannot sustain the loads it is required to sustain anymore. Current methods of doing the above still require empirically determined correction factors to account for material-related scatter, which require expensive physical tests to determine. The 1D convolutional network is trained on a combined dataset, which consists of the fatigue test data from the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) AR-07/22 report, augmented by data generated by a crack growth analysis program, with initial conditions and load sequences akin to those in the FAA's fatigue test. This initial version of the model obtained an average MSE of 1.05, MAE of 0.85 and an average MAPE of 125.26 over the 110-sequence testing set.},

The focus of our study is to establish stress and electrical contributions of such materials in a typical 3D-IC integration through a small test vehicle at wafer and chip levels.

The increased integration level for wearable devices has proposed higher request for power sources. Conventional button cell has become bulky for epidermal and implantable medical sensing. Wireless power delivery employing RFID technology including near field communication (NFC) is a common solution in such a case. In this paper some related problems for NFC technology such as coil inductor coupling and inductor geometry optimization is discussed and simulated with HFSS.

And the necessary and sufficient condition is found, which gives the accurate range of the parameter, even a little complex in analytical form. Simulation shows a clear comparison between these two conditions.

title={A new live video streaming approach based on Amazon S3 pricing model},
year={2018},

pages={321-328},
abstract={Video has become a mainstream media source on the web, and live video streaming is growing as a prominent player in the modern marketplace for both businesses and individuals. Due to elasticity and on-demand nature that cloud computing provides, more and more video service providers (VSP) utilize cloud infrastructures to provide cloud-based video applications. In this work, we propose Cloud Live Video Streaming (CLVS) - a new approach to efficiently stream live video that is based on Amazon S3 pricing model. In the design of CLVS, when a source video is being recorded by a mobile device, on which then it is segmented and encoded. Next, those video segments are pushed into a designated Amazon S3 bucket. On end-user devices, the client program of CLVS directly retrieves the most recent video segment from the S3 bucket, then performs decoding and video playing back. By using Amazon S3 service, our CLVS employs what is referred to as a “serverless” design by eliminating the needs for an intermediary and persistently running streaming server. Thus, VSPs do not have to pay for the idle time found on the traditional streaming servers, but still are able to continually provide live video streams to end viewers. We implement a prototype of CLVS and optimize its performance by using multithreaded prefetching and caching techniques. In experiments, we compare our CLVS with an existing video streaming software - Wowza Streaming Engine. Experiment results indicate that CLVS not only outperforms Wowza in many aspects of video streaming performance, but also financially costs less.},

abstract={Multiple site fatigue damage is a problem that affects many operators of aging aircraft. The methods currently in place for prediction of such damage are conservative, sensitive to noise and cannot fully account for grain-level material variations, which results in aircrafts being more conservatively designed than they need to be. The authors augmented the dataset of the FAA AR-07/22 report into a sizable body of variable- and constant-amplitude multiple-site fatigue damage sequences. This was done implementing and tuning the algorithm from AFGROW, implementing the plastic zone linkup criteria for crack interaction, as well as adding Gaussian noise at different stages of the computation. The interim model used for predicting the damage is a hybrid 1-D convolution and bidirectional LSTM model, which achieved an average of 171.26% MAPE, and 4.028 MSLE on the interim version of the dataset. A detailed breakdown of the error characteristics and the hyperparameters that have salient effects on the performance of the model are also examined.},

abstract={Disaggregation and rack-scale systems have the potential of drastically increasing TCO and utilization of cloud datacenters, while maintaining performance. In this paper, we present a novel rack-scale system architecture featuring software-defined remote memory disaggregation. Our hardware design and operating system extensions enable unmodified applications to dynamically attach to memory segments residing on physically remote memory pools and use such remote segments in a byte-addressable manner, as if they were local to the application. Our system features also a control plane that automates software-defined dynamic matching of compute to memory resources, as driven by datacenter workload needs. We prototyped our system on the commercially available Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC platform. To our knowledge, this is the first time a software-defined disaggregated system has been prototyped on commercial hardware and evaluated through industry standard software benchmarks. Our initial results - using benchmarks that are artificially highly adversarial in terms of memory bandwidth - show that disaggregated memory access exhibits a round-trip latency of only 134 clock cycles; and a throughput penalty of as low as 55%, relative to locally-attached memory. We also discuss estimations as to how our findings may translate to applications with pragmatically milder memory aggressiveness levels, as well as innovation avenues across the stack opened up by our work.},

abstract={One of the biggest problems facing operators of aging aircraft is making sure that their aircraft is structurally safe. Multiple site fatigue damage (MSD) refers to the presence of multiple fatigue cracks in the same structural element. These cracks interact with each other, rapidly increasing the crack growth rate, and this can result in a more sudden loss of structural integrity. This research is intended to explore the suitability of LSTM (Long and Short Term Memory recurrent neural network) to augment current fracture mechanics-derived analytical methods in the task of accurately predicting the cycle number at which a structural element's residual strength levels have been lowered enough that it cannot sustain the loads it is required to sustain any more. Current methods still require empirically determined correction factors to account for material variability and assembly tolerance-induced scatter. The LSTM tested in this paper is intended to be a part of a larger predictive system that can predict the life of a part, with manufacturing and in-service inspection and load monitoring results as its inputs. The LSTM is trained on a combined dataset, which consists of the fatigue test data from the Federal Aviation Administration's AR-07/22 report, combined with data generated by a crack growth simulator program, with initial conditions and loading similar to that encountered in the FAA's fatigue test. This original version of the model obtained an average MSE of 0.18 and an average MAE of 0.248 on the combined dataset, with the input and the output both normalized and centered.},

abstract={The federation of information technology (IT) systems is a common approach to bundle capabilities and get the best results for all participants. Cloud computing and electronic identity (eID) are only two out of many domains, for which federated solutions have been a topic of scientific and corporate interest during the past years. Recently, the H2020 project SUNFISH has introduced a new cloud-federation approach called `Federation as a Service' (FaaS). FaaS enables secure cloud federations, where data owners remain in full control of their data and workflows. In this paper, we identify shortcomings of the FaaS approach in terms of secure and reliable user authentication. In this sense, data security and protection mechanisms are only as good as the applied authentication measures. We solve this issue by proposing the integration of an existing pan-European federation of national eID systems into FaaS. This increases security guarantees of FaaS by using a trustworthy and liable eID solution that has a strong legal basis in the form of the EU eIDAS Regulation. A first successful implementation and deployment of the proposed solution demonstrates its feasibility and shows the great potential of combining federation solutions from the cloud domain and the eID domain.},

abstract={Serverless computing is a new cloud programming and deployment paradigm that is receiving wide-spread uptake. Serverless offerings such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda, Google Functions, and Azure Functions automatically execute simple functions uploaded by developers, in response to cloud-based event triggers. The serverless abstraction greatly simplifies integration of concurrency and parallelism into cloud applications, and enables deployment of scalable distributed systems and services at very low cost. Although a significant first step, the serverless abstraction requires tools that software engineers can use to reason about, debug, and optimize their increasingly complex, asynchronous applications. Toward this end, we investigate the design and implementation of GammaRay, a cloud service that extracts causal dependencies across functions and through cloud services, without programmer intervention. We implement GammaRay for AWS Lambda and evaluate the overheads that it introduces for serverless micro-benchmarks and applications written in Python.},

abstract={Serverless computing platforms provide function(s)-as-a-Service (FaaS) to end users while promising reduced hosting costs, high availability, fault tolerance, and dynamic elasticity for hosting individual functions known as microservices. Serverless Computing environments, unlike Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud platforms, abstract infrastructure management including creation of virtual machines (VMs), operating system containers, and request load balancing from users. To conserve cloud server capacity and energy, cloud providers allow hosting infrastructure to go COLD, deprovisioning containers when service demand is low freeing infrastructure to be harnessed by others. In this paper, we present results from our comprehensive investigation into the factors which influence microservice performance afforded by serverless computing. We examine hosting implications related to infrastructure elasticity, load balancing, provisioning variation, infrastructure retention, and memory reservation size. We identify four states of serverless infrastructure including: provider cold, VM cold, container cold, and warm and demonstrate how microservice performance varies up to 15x based on these states.},

abstract={Serverless computing has emerged as a compelling paradigm for the development and deployment of a wide range of event based cloud applications. At the same time, cloud providers and enterprise companies are heavily adopting machine learning and Artificial Intelligence to either differentiate themselves, or provide their customers with value added services. In this work we evaluate the suitability of a serverless computing environment for the inferencing of large neural network models. Our experimental evaluations are executed on the AWS Lambda environment using the MxNet deep learning framework. Our experimental results show that while the inferencing latency can be within an acceptable range, longer delays due to cold starts can skew the latency distribution and hence risk violating more stringent SLAs.},

abstract={The preterm infant are estimated to be around 15 million cases worldwide every year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) that is more than 1 in 10 babies worldwide 60% of them are born in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. So the babies born prematurely are generally kept in special chamber or sensitive unit care called “incubators” which are designed to help this preterm babies to keeping their bodies warm for the first several weeks of life. Because the infant incubator provides a stable level of temperature, relative humidity and oxygen concentration. Temperature control system is the most important part of the baby incubator which is around (37°C). This paper focuses on the comparison of two identification methods to get the best model from the experimental data and chooses the one that is nearest to the real process. The two methods are the identification system toolbox from Matlab environment and a software called HIDEN or Hito IDENTification.},

abstract={One key challenge of integrating Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) platforms into the National Airspace System is the potential for midair collisions between manned aircraft and the unmanned system. The lack of an established UAS benchmark for Detect, Sense and Avoid Systems put the preponderance of avoidance efforts on manned aircraft pilots to visually see and avoid potential collision threats. The small size, unusual configurations, and diverse operational applications of unmanned systems make UAS platforms difficult to visually identify. This paper sought to determine the mean visibility distance of small UAS systems (sUAS) to an alerted pilot flying a general aviation aircraft in visual meteorological conditions (VMC). The study evaluated mean visibility distance to various small UAS platforms based on a scripted set of UAS convergence conditions. The study utilized a quantitative, experimental design in which a general aviation aircraft was flown into a UAS operations area. Study pilots were instructed to locate a flying UAS aircraft without bearing assistance. Both the UAS and manned aircraft were assigned vertically de-conflicted altitudes with the UAS aircraft executing a series of converging and crossing courses relative to the manned aircraft. The distance at which the pilot visually located the UAS platform was timestamped and electronically recorded via a GPS tracking device. The various conditions were statistically analyzed to determine significant visibility differences among the various convergence conditions.},

title={Development of a European ionosphere threat model in support of GBAS deployment},
year={2018},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1181-1190},
abstract={GBAS is a Ground Based Augmentation System for GNSS that provides precision approach operations to aircraft. The main vulnerability of this system is the ranging error caused by the ionospheric propagation delay, which is mitigated by the development of local ionosphere threat model. EUROCONTROL launched a project in 2012 to develop such a model for Europe in support of current and future GBAS implementations. First, the appropriate GNSS data have been selected and retrieved. Based on existing networks of ground receivers, several clusters of GNSS ground receivers have been selected. This selection process was a trade-off between a reasonable number of ground stations on one side, and the need to cover the European latitudes but also to have the smallest distances between ground stations on the other side. As a result, 14 clusters were selected, located in the Canary Island (Spain, 28°N), Madrid (Spain, 40°N), Corsica (France, 42°N), Toulouse (France, 43°N), Friuli region (Italy, 46°N), Paris (France, 48°N), Prague (Czech Republic, 50°N), London (United Kingdom, 51°N), Hamburg (Germany, 53°N), Malmö (Sweden, 55°N), Göteborg (Sweden, 57°N), Stockholm (Sweden, 59°N), Lulea (Sweden, 65°N), and Gällivare (Sweden, 67°N). Data were retrieved from a total of 215 ground receivers and from October 8th, 2012 to March, 31th, 2016. Second, a dedicated MATLAB-based tool initially developed by Stanford to define the CONUS threat model and provided to EUROCONTROL by the FAA has been used to process the GNSS data. This tool has been largely modified and complemented with additional functions to match the European specificities. The GNSS raw data processing has been divided into different steps. The first step processes GNSS raw measurement stored in RINEX files and performs various corrections to compute “true” ionosphere delay per line of sight. In order to improve the raw measurement processing, an innovative technique based on a statistical analysis has been developed to correct for the cycle slips. The second step estimates the ionosphere gradients for every pair of ground stations within a cluster and sorts them in “nominal” gradient if the gradient is lower than a threshold, “anomalous” otherwise. “Nominal” gradients are then plotted together in a complementary cumulative histogram. “Anomalous” gradients are scanned through various consistency checks and a third step computes the following additional characteristic for the consistent gradients: the ionosphere front speed, direction and width. The last step is the manual validation of the processing. Although various and efficient correction and consistency checks are applied to the raw measurement, the processing needs to be manually validated to separate the “anomalous” gradients coming from measurement artefact (“fake” gradients) with the “anomalous” true gradients coming from ionosphere spatial variation. The various raw measurement corrections and consistency checks have been gradually improved through the development of several versions of the tool in order to reduce the number of measurement artefact detected. Additionally, specific tools have been developed to reduce the required effort to manually validate a gradient. The combination of these developments allowed the manual validation of a very large number of ionosphere gradients. All data from October 8th, 2012 to October, 1st, 2017 have been processed, and a total of 15340 potential gradients have been manually validated out of which, 1561 were true ionosphere gradients. The largest measured ionosphere gradient has a slope of 403 mm/Km, which remains lower than the boundary of the threat model developed for the Contiguous United State. However, this event has been measured at very low latitude from the Canary Islands cluster, and GBAS users at mid-latitude may use a different boundary. The ionosphere gradient location analysis has shown that most of them are occurring either at low latitude (below 35°N) or high latitude (above 60°N). In addition, the analysis of the gradient time of occurrence has shown that most of the gradients occurred around the equinoxes and during local night hours. These characteristics are very consistent with typical ionosphere behaviour and reinforce the confidence in the overall data processing methodology.},

abstract={A new form of cloud computing, serverless computing, is drawing attention as a new way to design micro-services architectures. In a serverless computing environment, services are developed as service functional units. The function development environment of all serverless computing framework at present is CPU based. In this paper, we propose a GPU-supported serverless computing framework that can deploy services faster than existing serverless computing framework using CPU. Our core approach is to integrate the open source serverless computing framework with NVIDIA-Docker and deploy services based on the GPU support container. We have developed an API that connects the open source framework to the NVIDIA-Docker and commands that enable GPU programming. In our experiments, we measured the performance of the framework in various environments. As a result, developers who want to develop services through the framework can deploy high-performance micro services and developers who want to run deep learning programs without a GPU environment can run code on remote GPUs with little performance degradation.},

One option is the Multifunction Phased Array Radar (MPAR) which seeks to combine the aircraft detection and tracking as well as weather surveillance into a single polarimetric PAR system. While the functionality of PAR technology for point targets is well-established, accurate polarimetric measurements of distributed targets have not yet been demonstrated. Currently, the cylindrical and planar architectures are being assessed for MPAR. The latter provides greater flexibility to perform point target and weather functions but (at least in theory) presents a greater challenge to achieve sufficient accuracy for polarimetric weather measurements. To evaluate the performance of a planar polarimetric PAR for weather surveillance, MPAR Advanced Technology Demonstrator (ATD) is being constructed by the MIT Lincoln Laboratory and will be installed in Norman, OK.

abstract={In 2016, the FAA, NOAA, DoD, and DHS initiated a feasibility study for a Spectrum Efficient National Surveillance Radar (SENSR). The goal is to assess approaches for vacating the 1.3- to 1.35-GHz radio frequency band currently allocated to FAA/DoD long-range radars so that this band can be auctioned for commercial use. As part of this goal, the participating agencies have developed preliminary performance requirements that not only assume minimum capabilities based on legacy radars, but also recognize the need for enhancements in future radar networks. The relatively low density of the legacy radar networks, especially the WSR-88D network, had led to the goal of enhancing low-altitude weather coverage. With multiple design metrics and network possibilities still available to the SENSR agencies, the benefits of low-altitude coverage must be assessed quantitatively. This study lays the groundwork for estimating Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (QPE) differences based on network density, array size, and polarimetric bias. These factors create a pareto front of cost-benefit for QPE in a new radar network, and these results will eventually be used to determine appropriate tradeoffs for SENSR requirements. Results of this study are presented in the form of two case examples that quantify errors based on polarimetric bias and elevation, along with a description of eventual application to a national network in upcoming expansion of the work.},

abstract={Numerous protocols allow modern aircraft to communicate with ground entities over wireless networks, including the so-called Datalink digital communications protocols such as ACARS and FANS-1/A. Among other benefits, they greatly enhance automation and allow communication between embedded avionics and aircraft components with ground infrastructure. Unfortunately, none of these protocols incorporate any form of message authentication or confidentiality. To date, no security counter-measures have been proposed to address this with the exception of the ARINC 823 ACARS Message Security (AMS) standard currently employed by the US Air Force to communicate with the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) air traffic controllers. In this paper, we present a threat analysis of the security flaws in the context of modern usage Datalink communications in aviation. To do so, we first describe how Software Defined Radios (SDR) have made easy to mount impersonation and message spoofing attack on both ACARS and FANS1/A datalink protocols. We then evaluate the potential impact of such attacks on both aircraft safety and air traffic management. To lend credence to our analysis, we describe a proof-of-concept implementation of this attack with a Universal Software Radio Project (USRP) SDR. Finally, we studied the viability of widely adopting AMS as an authentication solution by analyzing its real-world impact in terms of frequency congestion. We show that the widespread adoption of AMS, or an equivalent solution, by all commercial aircrafts would be sustainable.},

abstract={The New York Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Test Site is developing a next-generation capability for supporting extended UAS beyond line-of-sight (BLOS) operations in airport terminal areas and in transition airspace. The Test Site has set up an instrumented test range to provide air traffic surveillance. This test range currently extends from the Griffiss International Airport, in Rome, New York, and its Class D airspace to about 40 NM to the north. To safely integrate UAS into civil airspace, a robust detect and avoid (DAA) capability is required. RTCA Special Committee (SC) 228 is incorporating ground-based detect and avoid (GBDAA) into minimum operating performance standards (MOPS) for UAS DAA in the current SC-228 Phase Two. SC-228 is also developing GB primary radar MOPS for detecting noncooperating air traffic. SC-228 Phase Two MOPS development scope supports civil UAS equipped to operate under IFR rules in extended UAS operations in Class D, E, and G, airspace, down to but not including ground operations. The guiding RTCA SC-228 Terms of Reference (TORs) focus on both airborne DAA systems (with sensors onboard the unmanned aircraft) and GBDAA sensors. While the SC-228 DAA MOPS scope is limited to large UAS operating under IFR, this paper makes a case that SC-228 MOPS-compliant GBDAA systems can also support small UAS operations in Very Low Level (VLL) airspace. The New York UAS Test Site Griffiss test range system employs multi-sensor fusion, using a combination of primary radar, wide area multilateration, and ADS-B, to track both cooperative and noncooperative air traffic. The system operates in combination with other dedicated air traffic surveillance sensors, including airborne DAA sensors. The system incorporates data collection, storage, and analysis capabilities supporting UAS integration into terminal and transition airspace, with live, virtual and constructive (LVC) simulation capabilities. By repurposing and leveraging mature systems such as ASDE-X and ASSC, the New York UAS Test Site not only avoids development of completely new prototype systems but also secures the advantage of built-in system health and performance monitoring. This paper supports the argument that dedicated capabilities such as those under development at the New York UAS Test Site are necessary to support development of concepts of operation (ConOps) and performance standards for future certification of UAS DAA systems.

abstract={Aviation evolution points to new entrants such as Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), urban air taxi and other on-demand mobility (ODM) vehicles, and commercial space vehicles, operated by individuals and different kinds of organizations [1, 2], To date, there has not been significant research focused on the planning needs of the various stakeholders involved in these operations and on envisioning a NAS that supports collaborative operations planning for a wide variety of vehicles and operations [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], The future NAS must be shared equitably among all classes of vehicles used for various missions that present different safety and planning challenges. In a preliminary effort to advance research in this area, Mosaic ATM developed a software prototype, named the NAS Integrated Collaborative Planning System (NICoPS), to support all NAS users in planning their operations in collaboration with traffic managers and licensing personnel. NICoPS supports a variety of airspace users, including emerging markets with different operation and vehicle types. It considers the information requirements of both traffic management and operations licensing personnel in carrying out negotiation across different time scales. It supports airspace users in developing, proposing, and negotiating safe and efficient routes; FAA traffic management personnel in maintaining safe and efficient NAS operations; and licensing personnel responsible for evaluating individual operations to manage risk to the general public. This paper summarizes a research effort performed by Mosaic ATM for the NASA Ames Research Center and provides an overview of NICoPS, beginning with a section that explores documenting planning needs of various NAS stakeholders, continuing with a section on the design of the software prototype that meets those needs, and finishing with a brief section that covers ideas for future research to advance the concept.},

title={Integration of UAS in existing air traffic management systems connotations and consequences},
year={2018},
volume={},

pages={2G3-1-2G3-7},
abstract={The current airspace rules have evolved over a century of manned flight. This is not to say that they are ideal but they are known and all operators apply them. This paper examines the issues raised by integrating UAS in the existing `air traffic management systems' and airspace, and, the connotations of the integration and the subsequent consequences for both manned and unmanned aircraft. `Integration' means fitting in with the current operators in the airspace and with those users' rules and behaviors. It does not mean setting up UAS reservations, otherwise known as UAS Traffic Management; nor does it mean adding new rules and regulations that limit the existing manned aviation operations. An indication of the size of the problem in the USA is that there are 230,000 manned aircraft; fixed, wing, helicopters, gliders etc., but there are already 770,000 UAS registered with the FAA (not including those unregistered purchased on EBAY or `toy' stores) So the UAS being integrated are three times more than manned, but the value of the manned aviation sector to the USA is 1.8% GDP and cannot be hazarded. So manned/unmanned integration must be well planned. Yet it is apparent from SESAR and NextGen that the current ATM systems and their ConOps are at their scalability limit adding more aircraft will lead to delays and potentially reduce safety. Even the definition of the airspace is being challenged. It is unclear whether the FAA actually has authority to regulate aircraft operations below 500ft or 400ft or 83ft dependent on which case law is used. Neither is it clear whether State or City laws have precedence over FAA regulation. If deliveries by `drone' are a commercial use case, then not being able to descend below 83ft above ground is a significant limitation that cannot be overcome by throwing money. Existing manned operators are clear that at low level they are in Class G airspace where the Rules of the Air and Visual Flight Rules pertain. But UAS cannot fly Visual Flight Rules so they will fly `Detect and Avoid'. The Rules of the Air require a pecking order of aircraft type avoidance precedence based on seeing and identifying the aircraft type. UAS cannot `detect' the aircraft type so cannot apply the Rules of the Air for example; the flight rules require that a Predator must avoid a hang glider but it cannot sense the other aircraft type so cannot obey the rules of the air. In mandatory IFR airspace the UAS will be required to follow IFR; one of the IFR regulations is on loss of communications an aircraft should follow its last clearance to destination; not loiter or have a `lost link procedure'. Can an IFR UAS that has lost its link to the ground station fly the remainder of the mission including fitting in with an arrival sequence? This paper proposes an approach that could allow the number of aircraft operating be raised by a factor of four and still be safe to operate. The approach fits with the proposed ConOps from SESAR and NextGen of using Trajectory Based Operations. All aircraft would be treated equally whether manned or unmanned but would also be required to follow the same ConOps. It is achievable as it considers that an aircraft is an aircraft regardless of whether it has a pilot on board, and the connotation is that all aircraft should be treated equally but the consequence is that they must all meet the same basic level of capability. The impact on UAS avionics architectures and operations are highlighted and are significant. UAS can be integrated into the current ATM airspace but it will require significant changes in both the UAS systems and the systems analysis approach.},

abstract={Significant fuel and emissions savings can be realized by an efficient air traffic management system. Throughout the recent years, vertical flight efficiency has been identified as an improvement area. Continuous climb and descent operations are important elements of the on-going air navigation system modernization efforts. This paper expands the joint work by FAA and EUROCONTROL with a view to develop a harmonized understanding and methodology to measure and assess operational air traffic management performance. The work is conducted as an empirical study under the umbrella of the biennial regional US/Europe operational comparison report. Next to updating the assessment of the descent phase, the 2018 edition will include and assess the climb phase. The overall comparison is augmented with case studies for specific airports where a balance between operational constraints and improved efficiency needs to be struck. While initial results point at a higher benefit potential for the descent phase, addressing both phases of flight is essential to provide policy makers and air traffic management decision makers with performance results to further prioritize implementation options and changes to the operational concept.},

abstract={It is said, “A theoretical plan does not survive reality”1. Management of disruptive forces, positive or negative, requires a methodology focused on the continuous monitoring of emerging capabilities and aviation trends. The methodology can lead to the systematic resolution of strategic issues that can affect the future National Airspace System (NAS). This paper will identify aviation strategic outlook areas that will affect the evolution and implementation of Communications, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management systems that will enable the Future NAS vision. Strategic Outlook Areas examined in this paper are: Resiliency of the NAS, management of NAS Infrastructure and Technology Management planning, reducing the environmental footprint of aviation, minimizing the impact of weather on operations, understanding the Internet-of-Things on aviation, and New Aviation Entrants. In each area, the paper will explore the background, challenges they poses to achieving the future NAS, and key questions that need to be answered to leverage an opportunity or mitigate a risk. The goal of the Aviation Strategic Outlook effort serves as an instrument to inform decision-makers on potential policy, capabilities, procedures, and technology decisions to maintain an appropriate path to the desired or target future. The expected results will set the stage to define an impact statement, identify risks and opportunities to implementation, and proposed strategies to inform decision-makers on a pathway to achieve the future NAS vision.},

year={2018},
volume={},

pages={3E2-1-3E2-15},
abstract={Management by Trajectory (MBT) is a NASA concept for taking Trajectory Based Operations (TBO) to the next level of maturity. MBT looks beyond enabling technologies to flesh out the operational concept and look at how TBO changes the ways in which actors interact. In MBT, each aircraft has an assigned trajectory that is negotiated between the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and airspace user (AU) and complies with all National Airspace System (NAS) constraints. Any deviation from the assigned trajectory must be negotiated. In addition to the request/response interactions between controllers and pilots that have so far been proposed to support Data Comm, trajectory negotiation under MBT leverages emerging capabilities to support much richer negotiations. MBT proposes a higher level language to support new kinds of requests and responses, such as providing new or amended constraints to which a trajectory must conform and allowing the trajectory to be proposed by the AU, or controllers offering solution options to the AU for the AU to select the preferred solution. The key MBT benefit mechanisms are trajectory predictability and AU flexibility. Improved predictability supports more efficient operations, from earlier and less frequent conflict detection and resolution to better calibration of traffic flow management decision-making to balance demand with capacity. Improved flexibility allows AUs to act on their trajectory preferences. This paper provides an overview of the MBT concept and discusses open questions to be explored in future concept evaluation activities.},

abstract={Simultaneous arrivals to closely spaced parallel runways (CSPR) are permissible when visual approaches can be conducted, and visual separation from the lead aircraft and its wake can be provided by the trail aircraft flight crew. During instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), CSPR visual approaches cannot be conducted, and instrument approach procedures are used. These procedures reduce the airport capacity because of increased separation to compensate for surveillance uncertainty and larger collision avoidance response times associated with having a controller in the loop. To increase capacity during IMC, the Paired Approach procedure has been developed. The Paired Approach procedure is a part of Interval Management (IM), which leverages automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) Out for the lead aircraft (referred to as the Target aircraft) and ADS-B In for the trail aircraft (referred to as the IM aircraft). During the Paired Approach procedure, the IM aircraft uses speed commands from the flight-deck IM (FIM) equipment to maintain precise spacing between itself and the Target aircraft. The IM flight crew is given a time-based spacing parameter referred to as the assigned spacing goal, which is the desired spacing behind the Target aircraft. The desired spacing between the IM and Target aircraft in a Paired Approach operation is the spacing that will keep the IM aircraft far enough behind the Target aircraft to avoid the risk of a collision while still being close enough to the Target aircraft to avoid an encounter with its wake. The FAA is conducting a Paired Approach Flight Demonstration at San Francisco International Airport in early 2019. Honeywell is developing the prototype avionics that will be used and Alaska Airlines, United Airlines, and Honeywell are providing aircraft. The FAA is choosing to scope the demonstration based on a limited part of the Paired Approach operational concept due to technology and concept maturity.},

abstract={This paper outlines the methods used for validating the Flight & Flow Information for a Collaborative Environment (FF-ICE) Provisions and Implementation Guidance as well as the process of developing and executing tabletop activities, as conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The validation activities include both tabletop and laboratory exercises. The recommendations and observations from these activities are provided to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), whose members have the task of proposing processes to succeed the present-day operations to enable the realization of the Operational Concept. Global air traffic is increasing, and systems and processes that can manage the growth and standardize operations are required. The FAA's International Interoperability Harmonization and Validation (IIH&V) project is addressing these challenges by blending advances in airborne and ground technology, and focusing on the operational improvements that these technologies may enable. By exploring the interactions that Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) and airspace users (AUs) could encounter during these future operations, the team is able to provide feedback to that can be adopted by the international aviation community. The FAA provided recommended procedure diagrams to address message submissions and expected responses, a lexicon to normalize definitions for all users, and suggested further exercises exploring airborne message exchanges. These findings will be discussed in detail within this paper. Ultimately, these exercises allow the FAA to participate in the development of a cohesive operating environment while advancing the goals of global harmonization and interoperability.},

abstract={The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Manual on Flight and Flow Information for a Collaborative Environment (FF-ICE) outlines the components and requirements to achieve a common picture in global Air Traffic Management (ATM) for implementation readiness in 2020. To prepare for this global implementation by ATM stakeholders and ensure the technical feasibility and interoperability across implementations, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) initiated the International Interoperability Harmonization and Validation project (IIH&V) to validate the FF-ICE Planning Provisions [1], FF-ICE Implementation Guidance [2], and message exchanges in a lab environment. This paper explores the technical components of the FAA's IIH&V exercise while the complementary paper “An Operational Approach to FF-ICE Planning and Global Harmonization through IIH&V” explores operational components of the exercises. In order to effectively validate the FF-ICE Planning provisions and implementation guidance, it was required that the exercises focus on two areas. The first focus area was ensuring that future versions of the ICAO exchange models (primarily FIXM) were prepared to support FF-ICE. The second focus area was identifying system-level implementation decisions that could affect international interoperability, critical components to implementation readiness. Thus, the role of the ICAO exchange models, the role of data governance, and the feedback communicated to the FIXM Configuration Control Board (CCB) and the ATM Requirements Performance Panel (ATMRPP) are discussed herein. The FAA split the focus of the IIH&V project into three sequential validation exercises, with each exercise integrating more advanced systems into the lab infrastructure. For each exercise, the paper presents a system architecture diagram as well as an overview of the messages exchanged across systems. Several validation exercises have taken place in the context of a mixed mode environment in which only a subset of actors is FF-ICE capable, thus requiring the use of “bridging” capabilities such as data transformation to allow systems to remain interoperable despite differences in message type, version, etc. Validation 1 included the initial “mixed mode” environment envisioned in 2020 in which FF-ICE capable actors have implemented pre-departure FF-ICE message exchanges for pre-departure trajectory negotiations, while other actors are still using legacy capabilities. Validation 2 expanded trajectory negotiation into the post-departure portion of an active flight using bi-directional Air-to-Ground (A/G) System Wide Information Management (SWIM) data links, and single or bi-directional communications between the Flight Management System (FMS) and Electronic Flight Bag (EFB). Validation 3 further explored post-departure trajectory negotiation leveraging Data Communication (DataComm) messages in addition to A/G SWIM. The outputs and results of the IIH&V project outlined in this paper bring clarity to FF-ICE Planning Provisions and Implementation Guidance, as well as support the authoring organizations refining these documentations through input given to the ATMRPP. The IIH&V project also begins laying the groundwork for the development of FF-ICE Execution for post-departure.},

abstract={The majority of general aviation (GA) pilots use mobile devices to conduct many tasks related to flight operations, including performing flight planning, filing Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) flight plans, and retrieving weather briefings. However, there is an opportunity in the aviation community to implement additional mobile device capabilities for electronic (non-verbal) services, such as clearance delivery, departure release, and pre-departure data exchange, to streamline GA pilot operations. The MITRE Corporation (MITRE) has researched how leveraging mobile application technologies for these purposes has the potential to reduce pilot and air traffic control (ATC) workload, mitigate operational risk, and enable pilots to exchange data that will improve scheduling. MITRE has developed a research prototype pilot application and data exchange model to explore this evolutionary vision. This paper provides a detailed description of these concepts, the operational benefits of the various functions, and the data architecture. It also highlights the initial findings of an on-going field demonstration at Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) conducted to test the pre-departure data exchange capability. The goal of our work is to mature these concepts so that we can transition the methods and processes to appropriate government and industry entities, who can use them for internal use or create commercially available and supported products that will further GA safety and scheduling.},

To improve the safety, security, and efficiency of air traffic operations, more digital information technologies are being introduced to provide additional Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance (CNS) services. Through aviation radio technology advancement, it may be possible to increase the data capacity and functionality of existing systems and still maintain backward compatibility without increasing the demand on the already crowded aviation spectrum. This paper presents concepts for transparently introducing data capabilities into the Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) signal, and identifies potential aviation applications that may make use of this data capability. In conducting our research, we developed both analytical and simulation models for assessing the DME data capacities. We also evaluated various potential CNS services that could be enabled, and found that DME spectrum could be used more efficiently, providing a channel for data exchange to support additional CNS services.},

Participating airlines include Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines. The domain for storm product creation is contained by the scanning area of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-East and GOES-West satellites. Routes to be flown are between the continental United States (CONUS) and South America, Caribbean, Australia, and South Africa, among others. A select number of airline line check pilots will participate in the demonstration. The ROMIO demonstration will begin in spring of 2018 and continue for approximately 9 months.

year={2018},
volume={},

abstract={The measurement of takeoff and landing distance during flight testing of general aviation aircraft requires an accurate measurement of aircraft position over the ground and altitude up to 50 feet above surface elevation. Current methods of evaluating takeoff and landing distances include cinetheodolites, laser and radar trackers, and Differential Global Positioning Systems. The use of laser altimetry to get altitude above the ground originated with military and agricultural aircraft. The AgLaser module was an infrared laser ranging unit designed for agricultural aircraft to gauge optimal spray height above a field. The AgLaser system has a stated accuracy of 2.0 inches and a maximum range of 500 feet. By integrating the AgLaser system into the Flight Test Data Acquisition System designed at Florida Institute of Technology, the ability exists to measure takeoff and landing distance more accurately than currently acceptable methods. The integration of the laser module and the instrumentation unit occurred across an RS-232 serial connection and a modified LabVIEW interface. Through a series of ground and flight tests conducted at Florida Institute of Technology and Valkaria Airport, the integrated system was validated. Data from this research can be presented to the Federal Aviation Administration for consideration as an accurate, cost-effective means of measuring takeoff and landing distances for aircraft certification per 14 CFR Part 23.},

This paper presents suggestions for new methods of compliance for Angle-of-Attack (AOA) warning systems and AOA-limiting systems. The methods of compliance were derived from a flight campaign on the Technical University of Munich's fly-by-wire DA42 research aircraft. The team consisted of GA test pilots, experienced flight test engineers, research assistants, and college students. The project explored novel concepts for audio, visual and haptic AOA warning. Classic test-matrix approaches were compared to pilot-tracking tasks designed to put GA aircraft in conditions that activate AOA-warning or AOA-limiting systems. Lessons learned in the execution of this flight test program, as well as the system integration of the advanced technologies, are provided.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are swiftly becoming a large sector for research and development. However, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has set forth many regulations that UAS must comply with before they are able to be integrated into the National Airspace System (NAS). Among these regulations is for all UAS to have an ability analogous to a human pilot's ability to “see-and-avoid.” This system must be capable of detecting both large and small obstacles, such as terrain and intruding aircraft. A Detect-and-Avoid (DAA) algorithm is currently in development at the University of North Dakota (UND) in order to comply with these regulations. However, while this DAA algorithm is capable of detecting and avoiding cooperative targets through an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) system, UAS are also required to detect and avoid uncooperative obstacles. This paper describes a proof-of-concept solution to this problem by integrating a small RADAR into UND's current DAA algorithm.},

abstract={One of the disadvantages of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) communications protocol is its vulnerability to a number of security attacks since it broadcasts information of the flying aircraft carrying the device over unencrypted datalink. As the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has mandated the use of ADS-B by 2020, solid, reliable security solutions are needed to secure ADS-B data exchange. The first step in this regard is investigating ADS-B attacks and their impacts on air traffic. Therefore, in this paper, we describe a preliminary work performed to study some effects of an ADS-B attack category, message injection, using Hardware in the Loop testing platform. Using a set of flight plans developed to generate aircraft encounters, results show that this attack can distract pilots and ground controllers, cause air traffic disturbance, and increase the risk of aircraft collisions.},

abstract={This paper presents a system designed for Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) operations incorporating light (<;7 kg) and frangible structures, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) transceivers and light weight radar for air traffic detection and avoidance. In recent years, there has been a steep increase in number of UAS and the trend indicates a further increase. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) projections point towards a total commercial UAS fleet size greater than 400 000. The congestion of air traffic leads to an increase in the risk posed to general aviation and efforts are taken to mitigate this development. A holistic collision avoidance protocol requires attention to be paid to pre-flight mission planning, integration of cooperative collision avoidance equipment and techniques, development of non-cooperative collision avoidance equipment and an appropriate choice of platform. The main focus of this paper is the feasibility study of a non-cooperative traffic detection system for small UAS. The proposed method is a continuous wave radar. It is light weight (450 g), low power (5 W), operates at 24 GHz and has an Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power (EIRP) of +20 dBm. The system was tested in ground-to-air experiments that showed a detection range of 400 m of a target with 1.1m2Radar Cross Section (RCS) corner reflector mounted facing the radar. There was no sign of interference with the test-target aircraft due to the use of the system. Confirmation of the minimum detection range was achieved with air-to-air tests, when the radar clearly picked up the same target at a distance of 480 m (the maximum range tested). The increased situational awareness of the aircraft with the radar mounted on board showed a result better than human eye detection of the small target aircraft due to a larger RCS than visual signature of the target. Based on the proven feasibility of radar technology for collision avoidance on board small UAS, further work can be pursued into optimization of such a system, versatility of platform and product manufacturing.},

abstract={Increased autonomy promises many advantages in the aviation domain, especially for unmanned aerial systems and small aircraft. However, several critical challenges remain and must be solved before highly autonomous or “unpiloted” operation can be fully realized. Of these challenges, safety and safety assurance is of utmost importance. Run-time assurance (RTA) has been shown, both theoretically and experimentally, to be a very promising avenue upon which to assure safety of the myriad of functions required for effective flight. This paper develops concepts based around an RTA architecture composed of multiple safety monitors encompassing and assuring many flight functions. Implementation of the concepts described in this work was performed on a small-unmanned air vehicle (SUAV) as a part of the NASA/FAA Traveler project. Lessons learned in requirements generation, system design, and operations are presented along with flight test results. These results are applicable to not only SUAV, but also to small manned aircraft and other vehicle systems where safety assured autonomy is desired.},

abstract={This paper presents a preliminary study of Raman spectroscopic measurement of chromium traces in leather and its processed forms such as shavings, hydrolyzate and ash. The emphasis is given on the valence of chromium, especially two most stable forms trivalent and hexavalent, as they have adverse effect on human health. Trivalent form is mainly beneficial. Compounds of hexavalent chromium are classified as carcinogens. The conventional methods for chromium assessments (e.g. FAAS) are often time-consuming and destructive. Some of methods give only the total chromium content value, which is not sufficient due to the nature of different valences. The official UV-VIS spectrophotometry is designed mainly for liquid samples. The innovative approach is the study of Raman spectroscopy possibilities. Raman spectroscopy is an efficient method for material identification reflecting the molecular structure. This method provides many benefits such as rapidity, non-invasiveness, no requirements for sample preparation, applicability to various materials. The results of the performed experiments show the hidden potential of Raman spectroscopy for the chromium detection with the benefit of direct determination of valence. The limitation can be by emerging luminescent. Silver colloidal treatment of luminescent samples indicated more intense Raman signal. An agreement was reached with trivalent and hexavalent chromium content in specially treated leather samples and the ash.},

In this paper, for the purpose of improving the DC-link voltage regulation control in the shunt APF under nonlinear load variation and reducing the total harmonic distortion of the current effectively, a novel recurrent probabilistic fuzzy neural network with an asymmetric membership function (RPFNN-AMF) controller is developed to substitute for the conventional proportional-integral controller. Moreover, the network structure, the online learning algorithm, and the convergence analysis of the proposed RPFNN-AMF are detailedly introduced.

abstract={The goal of this research paper is to investigate the viability and advantages of using a software controlled RS-232 and RS-485 pattern generator versus a stored version of a pseudo-random test pattern for effective telecommunication test impairment measurements sets (TIMS). Previous developments of the digital virtual test impairment measurement sets (DVTIMS) required an additional circuit board to be built using transistor-to-transistor logic (TTL). It also required using the digital input/output (DIO) pins to generate the patterns within the communication standards (RS-232; RS-485). This setup is needed and commonly used by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) technicians. This investigation is carried out by capturing the hexadecimal format of each pseudo-random pattern available on modern test sets in the hexadecimal format by using a software program developed. This requires sending those captured patterns over the onboard RS-232 port to a Fireberd 6000A, and then analyzing the data to see if the two would communicate. If successful communication is established between the two devices, it would eliminate the need in the future to have any additional circuit boards in the newer versions of the DVTIMS. This would save the FAA money and time-to-market, reduce size and weight, and give expandability to future adaptations of serial communication (USB and RJ-45 connections). The proposed methods have commercial potential applications that offer affordable, portable, and highly effective test equipment to take over the day-to-day maintenance tasks that their technicians are performing to ensure the quality of their services.},

abstract={This paper presents the design and implementation of a stereo camera system used to produce accurate three-dimensional flight tracks of aircraft during the visual approach segment of an instrument landing approach procedure. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has developed a model of collision risk for all phases of flight. Currently, the data available for low-altitude segments is sparse because radar is not capable of operating below certain altitudes in most terminal areas. Instrument approaches are particularly critical because the reduced visibility forces the pilot to rely on the navigational equipment and the airspace set aside for such an approach. The FAA desires to collect accurate data on flight paths during instrument approaches in order to more thoroughly model the risk of collision with obstacles during this critical phase of flight. The current system uses classic geometry and image processing to determine a frame-by-frame East-North-Up position of the approaching aircraft relative to the centerline point of the runway threshold. Truth flight tests indicate that the position accuracy can be maintained within three meters in the vertical and cross-track directions, and less than 30 meters in the distance measurement.},

abstract={Today, botnet continue to be a significant threat to Internet, and is still responsible for most large scale cyber-attacks. An obvious strategy for preventing these activities is detecting Command-and-Control (C&C) servers of the botnet. Once C&C servers have been discovered, the botnet would face the risk of the whole structure's failure, and defenders can easily trace the owner. Recently years, attackers have begun to exploit social network websites (e.g., twitter.com) as their C&C infrastructures, which turns out to be quite stealthy but still can be detected through the application-centric approach, such as monitoring the behavior of particular usernames. In this paper, we assess the efficacy and feasibility of abusing multiple different public services to construct botnets, and propose a serverless C&C channel model using a novel strategy named Service Flux, which contains three subchannels: addressing channel (AC), command channel (CC), and upload channel (UC). We implement the model based botnet prototype named SLBot, and evaluate the resilience and efficiency of it.},

abstract={Commercial use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, promises to revolutionize the way in which consumers interact with retail services. However, the further adoption of UAVs has been significantly impeded by an overwhelming public outcry over the privacy implications of drone technology. While lawmakers have attempted to establish standards for drone use (e.g., No-Fly-Zones (NFZs)), at present a general technical mechanism for policy enforcement eludes state-of-the-art drones. In this work, we propose that Proof-of-Alibi (PoA) protocols should serve as the basis for enforcing drone privacy compliance. We design and implement AliDrone, a trustworthy PoA protocol that enables individual drones to prove their compliance with NFZs to a third party Auditor. AliDrone leverages trusted hardware to produce cryptographically-signed GPS readings within a secure enclave, preventing malicious drone operators from being able to forge geo-location information. AliDrone features an adaptive sampling algorithm that reacts to NFZ proximity in order to minimize the processing cost. Through laboratory benchmarks and field studies, we demonstrate that AliDrone provides strong assurance of geo-location while imposing an average of 1.5% overhead on CPU utilization and 0.3% of memory consumption. AliDrone thus enables the further proliferation of drone technology through the introduction of a trustworthy and accountable compliance mechanism.},

year={2019},

abstract={The synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) is a high-efficiency and low-cost motor with rugged structure. However, the nonlinear and time-varying control characteristics of the SynRM with high torque ripple confine the high-performance applications of this motor. Therefore, an intelligent backstepping control (BSC) using recurrent feature selection fuzzy neural network is proposed to construct a high-performance SynRM position servo drive system. First, the dynamic model of a vector control SynRM position servo drive is introduced. Second, a BSC system is designed for the tracking of the position reference. Since the lumped uncertainty of the SynRM position servo drive system is unavailable in advance, it is very difficult to design an effective BSC in practical applications. Moreover, the sign function in BSC will cause undesired chattering phenomenon, which will excite unknown dynamics and wear the ball bearing of the SynRM. To alleviate the existed difficulties in the BSC, the recurrent feature selection fuzzy neural network (RFSFNN) is proposed in this study to approximate an idea BSC. In addition, to compensate the possible approximated error of the RFSFNN, an improved adaptive compensator is augmented. The online learning algorithms of the RFSFNN are derived by using the Lyapunov stability method to assure asymptotical stability. Finally, the proposed control system is implemented in a 32-bit floating point digital signal processor. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed intelligent BSC system are verified by some experimental results.},

abstract={Decentralized online social networks (OSNs) have attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners as a viable alternative to the current centralized OSNs, whose business model is based on the exploitation of the private data of their users. Yet, pure decentralized models may either require significant investment on the user side in terms of hardware and bandwidth, or may fail to provide the desired user experience. In this paper, we propose a middle-ground solution that mainly relies on a serverless social overlay in which links represent friendship relations, but occasionally complements it with inexpensive storage rented from the cloud. The experimental evaluation based on a real OSN dataset confirms that our solution provides the desired quality of service at a low cost.},

abstract={User eXperience (UX) and at a higher level, Customer eXperience (CX) are trending topics in the industry. More than ever, many businesses and corporations have realized that their success in growing their user base and revenue is dependent on creating a good customer and user experience through their services and products. However, traditional systems development methods and life cycle models have not had their focus on user/customer experience and with the most recent application development frameworks and possibilities to spin up rapid serverless cloud-based APIs, opportunities exist to almost entirely separate the front-end and back-end development concerns. Such a separation implies a different development paradigm, which traditional methods have not addressed completely. This paper proposes a novel systems development life cycle model that integrates UX-related practices into the development process and postpones the back-end development to begin once the maturity of a prototype with enriched user experience is achieved. The proposed method has been evaluated by a community of practice in a case study which shows the success of the proposed method in a number of areas like separation of concerns, agility, and the perceived level of user experience.},

abstract={Media applications are amongst the most demanding services requiring high amounts of network capacity as well as extremely low latency for synchronous audio-visual streaming in production quality. Recent technological advances in the 5G domain hold the promise to unlock the potential of the media industry by offering high quality media services through dynamic efficient resource allocation. Actual implementations are now required to validate whether advanced media applications can be realised benefiting from ultra-low latency, very-high bandwidth and flexible dynamic configuration offered by these new 5G networks. A truly integrated approach is needed that focuses on the media applications not only on the management of generic network functions and the orchestration of resources at the various radio, fronthaul/backhaul, edge and core network segments. The H2020 5G PPP Phase 2 project 5G-MEDIA [1] leverages new options for more flexible, ad-hoc and cost-effective production workflows by replacing dedicated lines and hardware equipment with software functions (VNFs) facilitating (semi-) automated smart production in remote locations. Highly scalable virtualized media services deployed on or close to the edge reduce complexity for the user, ensure operational reliability and increase the Quality of Experience (QoE). Virtual compression engines have the potential to replace dedicated encoder/decoder hardware while the network optimisation (Cognitive Network Optimizer) in combination with the Quality of Service (QoS) monitoring helps to overcome the current internet best-effort principle and ensures that the required performance needs are met at all times.},

abstract={Media applications are amongst the most demanding services in terms of resources, requiring huge network capacity for high bandwidth audio-visual and other mobile sensory streams. The 5G-MEDIA project aims at innovating media-related applications by investigating how these applications and the underlying 5G network should be coupled and interwork to the benefit of both. The 5G-MEDIA approach aims at delivering an integrated programmable service platform for the development, design and operations of media applications in 5G networks by providing mechanisms to flexibly adapt service operations to dynamic conditions and react upon events (e.g. to transparently accommodate auto-scaling of resources, VNF replacement, etc.). In this paper we present the 5G-MEDIA service platform architecture, which has been specifically designed to enable the development and operation of services for the nascent 5G media industry. Our approach delivers an integrated programmable service platform for the development, design and operations of media applications in 5G networks.},

This sub-array based fractal array antenna is designed based on the concentric elliptical sub array geometric generator methodology. An alteration of the fractal array geometry is considered in which one of the antenna element is placed at the centre of the each sub-array of the deterministic triangular fractal array. Owing to the centre antenna element side lobe ratios are diminished from −25dB to −52dB and −30dB to −41dB in the triangular fractal array of second and third iterations simultaneously, with little variation in the side lobe level angle and beam width.},

year={2019},

pages={2605-2616},
abstract={Zeroing neural dynamics (ZND) can be seen as an effective controller to solve various challenging scientific and engineering problems. Computing Lyapunov equation is a kind of important issue in nonlinear systems for stability analysis in control. This paper presents a systematic and constructive procedure on using ZND to design control laws based on the efficient solution of dynamic Lyapunov equation. We particularly address three important aspects in the design: 1) the global stability of ZND, to guarantee the effectiveness of the solution; 2) the robustness against additive noises, to ensure the capability of ZND for using in harsh environments; and 3) the finite-time convergence of ZND, to endow ZND for real-time solution of dynamical problems. To do so, a novel formula is first designed in a unified manner of ZND. Differing from the conventional formula appearing in ZND, the proposed formula simultaneously has finite-time convergence and noise robustness property. According to this novel formula, a novel control law (termed nonlinear neural dynamics, NND) is established to compute dynamic Lyapunov equation in the presence of various additive noises. Both theoretical and simulative results ensure the finite-time convergence and noise robustness property of the NND model for computing dynamic Lyapunov equation in front of various additive noises. As compared to the conventional ZND model for computing dynamic Lyapunov, the superior property of the NND model is further demonstrated.},

abstract={Accurate counts of aircraft operations at unmonitored or partially-monitored general aviation airports are important due to their role in the allocation of funds for airport development and improvement. While the Federal Aviation Administration annually invests approximately $1B in small commercial and general aviation airports in the United States, fewer than 270 of these 2,950 airports have either full- or part-time air traffic personnel available to register operations counts. Aircraft operations at airports with limited personnel may be counted using temporary acoustic, pneumatic, or video devices, and observations from contract staff. The related sample sizes are inherently small, leading to inaccuracies in the extrapolation of long-term totals. The authors have developed an estimation procedure for use with small sample sizes that employs a Bayesian hierarchical model with a Poisson likelihood function. This procedure is used in conjunction with a counting device that registers operations counts based on aircraft transponder signals (also developed by the authors), and is shown to achieve an accuracy of 2.88% at a general aviation airport staffed with an FAA control tower over a one-month period.},

abstract={Mood disorders caused by chronic stress are mostly difficult to be recognized of by ourselves. Self-reported inventories, e.g., Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), as screening tests can elucidate the emotional valence; however, these tools are not designed for periodic monitoring in daily life. Moreover, positive affect is also hard to recognize without taking such self-reported inventories. Here we compared the indices of frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) obtained from electroencephalography (EEG) data in the resting state and laterality index at rest (LIR) from near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data. The Comfort Vector model (CVM) is another approach for using the feature value of prefrontal alpha wave fluctuation. In this paper, we discuss the applicability of these biomarkers for assessment of emotional valence. From experimental results from periodic NIRS and EEG recordings of two healthy subjects who participated for more than 4 weeks, feature values of FAA, LIR, and CVM were compared with BDI and STAI scores.},

Although serverless runtimes are limited to applications requiring lightweight computation and memory, such as machine learning prediction and inference, they have shown improvements on these applications beyond other cloud runtimes. Training deep learning can be both compute and memory intensive. We investigate the use of serverless runtimes while leveraging data parallelism for large models, show the challenges and limitations due to the tightly coupled nature of such models, and propose modifications to the underlying runtime implementations that would mitigate them.

abstract={Serverless computing provides a small runtime container to execute lines of codes without infrastructure management which is similar to Platform as a Service (PaaS) but a functional level. Amazon started the event-driven compute named Lambda functions in 2014 with a 25 concurrent limitation, but it now supports at least a thousand of concurrent invocation to process event messages generated by resources like databases, storage and system logs. Other providers, i.e., Google, Microsoft, and IBM offer a dynamic scaling manager to handle parallel requests of stateless functions in which additional containers are provisioning on new compute nodes for distribution. However, while functions are often developed for microservices and lightweight workload, they are associated with distributed data processing using the concurrent invocations. We claim that the current serverless computing environments can support dynamic applications in parallel when a partitioned task is executable on a small function instance. We present results of throughput, network bandwidth, a file I/O and compute performance regarding the concurrent invocations. We deployed a series of functions for distributed data processing to address the elasticity and then demonstrated the differences between serverless computing and virtual machines for cost efficiency and resource utilization.},

abstract={In serverless computing, developers define a function to handle an event, and the serverless framework horizontally scales the application as needed. The downside of this function-based abstraction is it limits the type of application supported and places a bound on the function to be within the physical resource limitations of the server the function executes on. In this paper we propose a new abstraction for serverless computing: a developer supplies a process and the serverless framework seamlessly scales out the process's resource usage across the datacenter. This abstraction enables processing to not only be more general purpose, but also allows a process to break out of the limitations of a single server - making serverless computing more serverless. To realize this abstraction, we propose ServerlessOS, comprised of three key components: (i) a new disaggregation model, which leverages disaggregation for abstraction, but enables resources to move fluidly between servers for performance; (ii) a cloud orchestration layer which manages fine-grained resource allocation and placement throughout the application's lifetime via local and global decision making; and (iii) an isolation capability that enforces data and resource isolation across disaggregation, effectively extending Linux cgroup functionality to span servers.},

abstract={Serverless computing, also known as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) or Cloud Functions, is a new method of running distributed applications by executing functions on the infrastructure of cloud providers. Although it frees the developers from managing servers, there are still decisions to be made regarding selection of function configurations based on the desired performance and cost. The billing model of this approach considers time of execution, measured in 100ms units, as well as the size of the memory allocated per function. In this paper, we look into the problem of scheduling scientific workflows, which are applications consisting of multiple tasks connected into a dependency graph. We discuss challenges related to workflow scheduling and propose the Serverless Deadline-Budget Workflow Scheduling (SDBWS) algorithm adapted to serverless platforms.

TheArchitect will provide any software developer to generate a proper architecture minimizing the involvement of an experienced software architect. Furthermore, the positives that microservices and serverless technologies has brought to the world of software engineering has made the software engineering community shift from the era of building large monolith applications containing overly complex designs, to microservices and serverless based technologies. Hence TheArchitect focuses on generating best fitted microservices and serverless based high-level architecture for a given application.},

Today, cloud computing, that is, using IT as a service, on-demand and pay-per-use, is a widely used computing paradigm that offers large economies of scale. Born from a need to make platform as a service (PaaS) more accessible, fine-grained, and affordable, serverless computing has garnered interest from both industry and academia. This article aims to give an understanding of these early days of serverless computing: what it is, where it comes from, what is the current status of serverless technology, and what are its main obstacles and opportunities.},

abstract={Induction motors excel other types of electrical motors in various applications with their advantages such as low cost, ruggedness, etc. The vector control method which is widely preferred for induction motor control requires speed and position measurement fed back from the motor. Speed sensors called encoders which are conventionally employed for this measurement are costly and space consuming. A method of speed and position estimation using a few additional sensing windings on the stator of the induction motor is discussed in this paper. The effects of rotor slot harmonics and back-EMF are exploited in this method. Speed and position information can be extracted from externally injected signals and from the induced voltages in the additional windings at different speeds and standstill. The speed and position estimation algorithms are discussed. Simulations are carried out and measurements on a real motor are performed. It is shown that the current and voltage signals in the additional windings contain speed and position information that could be extracted and fed to the controller.},

This paper proposes an improvement in CQ-Iearning, which is a typical method for sparse interaction tasks, taken from the perspective of action selection and updating augmented Q-values.

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles has been significantly gaining national and international interest recently. Texas A&M University at Corpus Christi has been recently approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as one of the six fully operational test site for unmanned vehicles in the United States in order to seamlessly integrate all UAS operations into the national airspace. The Unmanned aerial vehicles has been attracting researchers, industries and consumers for varied applications. Controlling the airflows over an airfoil or other aerodynamic surfaces for separation control and drag reduction are of significant interest to Airforce. The planar or surface plasmas have shown to have a significant effect on the drag reduction especially at high angle of incidences. The use of surface plasmas generated using plasma actuators on medium to large aerial vehicles has been of interest to the plasma actuator research community and has been widely researched. However, in the case of unmanned aerial vehicles that are usually small and light in weight and they do not have significant payload capacity. Contrarily, the power supply required to generate high-frequency high-voltage signal to create uniform surface plasmas in the plasma actuators are usually bulky and heavy, making it not suitable for the UAV application. The weight of the plasma power supply has been the limiting factor for the plasma actuator application on UAVs. Our research group has been developing a method to develop a light weight highfrequency high-voltage power supply and incorporate it in a plasma actuator on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In this work we will present the results of the plasma actuator performance and the performance of the UAV controlled with default servo motor based controls and plasma actuated control dynamics, mechanisms and efficiencies.},

abstract={The FAA and other Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) plan to share the existing cockpit data radio for NextGen data communication applications. This radio is currently used for supporting airline operations. Sharing this radio, which operates in a relatively open network environment, with mission critical air traffic control communications creates a need to address air-ground security. Most of the data to be shared over air-ground communication is tactical and transient in nature. In addition, secure communication between the controller and the pilot provides situational awareness to all receivers listening on the voice radio channel. In this paper we provide a rationale for securing air-ground communication and explore some of the issues in implementing a secure air-ground communication channel between the controller and the pilot over the shared radio. We recommend a lightweight approach based on Identity Based Encryption (IBE) that meets the security paradigms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system without compromising situational awareness.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a number of standards and regulations that are designed to protect occupants in the event of a crash. Compliance with these regulations is described in the Code of Federal Regulations 14 CFR 25.562 for transport category aircraft, with similar regulations for other types of aircraft in parts 23, 27, and 29. One of these required tests is a seated dynamic impact with either a Hybrid II or FAA Hybrid III Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD) with a pulse which has a primary vertical component. Vertical loading can be obtained in other environments such as under vehicle blast, ejection seat testing, or as part of a vehicle rollover. When the commonly used ATDs were developed, focus was placed on frontal impact performance with some consideration given to rear and lateral loading. It has recently been brought up that there could be significant variability in the compressive lumbar load measurement during vertical impacts. This variability could be between tests with the same ATD, between tests within the same ATD family, and between ATDs attempting to measure the same response. To quantify this issue, data from several test sources including from the Civil Aerospace Medical Institute, National Institute for Aviation Research and the Air Force Research Laboratory was collected. Cases were selected where the primary loading phase was in the vertical direction on a variety of ATDs including the Hybrid II, FAA Hybrid III, Hybrid III, and aerospace variants. These cases also included different configurations including restraint systems, cushions, and acceleration levels. This study was limited to only investigating the compressive variability and not the bending moment or in cases where significant multi axial loading could occur. Also, since these data were from different test laboratories, slight differences in test procedures could also have affected the results. Through this analysis it was shown that the Hybrid III had the most repeatable response whether it was the FAA Hybrid III or the aerospace Hybrid III. One issue noted was the lack of calibration methods for the lumbar spine to assess its current characteristics. Without this calibration method, there is no way other than visual inspection which would only show gross changes to determine when a lumbar spine segment has been degraded. Such a performance requirement should be developed for both ATDs currently in the field and those being newly developed and used such as the THOR.},

abstract={Neurofeedback has long been proposed as a promising form of adjunctive non-pharmaceutical treatment for a variety of neuropsychological disorders. However, there is much debate over its efficacy and specificity. Many suggest that specificity can only be achieved when a specially trained clinician manually updates reward thresholds that indicate to the trainee when they are modulating their brain activity correctly, during training. We present a novel fully automated reward thresholding algorithm called progressive thresholding and test it with a frontal alpha asymmetry neurofeedback protocol. Progressive thresholding uses dynamic difficulty tuning and individual-specific progress models to simulate the shaping a clinician might perform when setting reward thresholds manually. We demonstrate in a double-blind comparison that progressive thresholding leads to significantly better learning outcomes compared with current automatic reward thresholding algorithms.},

abstract={In the constantly changing technological landscape the concept of serverless computing in a public Cloud is a relatively new development. Over recent years the serverless abstraction has gained significant traction within the IT industry. Google, Microsoft and AWS all now provide feature equivalent serverless implementations as part of their Cloud-based offerings and solution architects throughout the industry are utilizing serverless as part of mission critical enterprise systems. Throughout this paper we examine the performance profile of the serverless ecosystem in a low latency, high availability context, present results on the integral performance of such systems and outline some practical mitigation strategies to optimize serverless architectures. We confine our investigation specifically to one aspect of the AWS implementation of serverless; known as AWS Lambda. Our results show there are opportunities to tune the performance characteristics of Lambda-based architectures and we outline considerations such as cold starts and potential latency characteristics created by a combination of factors including external systems and events. We propose a diverse set of strategies, approaches and techniques which, when successfully implemented and deployed, simultaneously play to its strengths with the ultimate goal of providing a set of design patterns aimed at increasing the capability of serverless computing to a wider set of problem domains.},

abstract={This review focuses on the evolution of cloud computing and distributed ledger technologies (blockchains) over the last decade. Cloud computing relies mainly on a conceptually centralized service provisioning model, while blockchain technologies originate from a peer-to-peer and a completely distributed approach. Still, noteworthy commonalities between both approaches are often overlooked by researchers. Therefore, to the best of the authors knowledge, this paper reviews both domains in parallel for the first time. We conclude that both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of centralized service provisioning approaches are often the disadvantages of distributed ledger approaches and vice versa. It is obviously an interesting question whether both approaches could be combined in a way that the advantages can be added while the disadvantages could be avoided. We derive a software stack that could build the foundation unifying the best of these two worlds and that would avoid existing shortcomings like vendor lock-in, some security problems, and inherent platform dependencies.},

pages={234-244},
abstract={Lambda platform is a new concept based on an event-driven server-less computation that empowers application developers to build scalable enterprise software in a virtualized environment without provisioning or managing any physical servers (a server-less solution). In reality, however, devising an effective consolidation method to host multiple Lambda functions into a single machine is challenging. The existing simple resource allocation algorithms, such as the round-robin policy used in many commercial server-less systems, suffer from lack of responsiveness to a sudden surge in the incoming workload. This will result in an unsatisfactory performance degradation that is directly experienced by the end-user of a Lambda application. In this paper, we address the problem of CPU cap management in a Lambda platform for ensuring different QoS enforcement levels in a platform with shared resources, in case of fluctuations and sudden surges in the incoming workload requests. To this end, we present a closed-loop (feedback-based) CPU cap controller, which fulfills the QoS levels enforced by the application owners. The controller adjusts the number of working threads per QoS class and dispatches the outstanding Lambda functions along with the associated events to the most appropriate working thread. The proposed solution reduces the QoS violations by an average of 6.36 times compared to the round-robin policy. It can also maintain the end-to-end response time of applications belonging to the highest priority QoS class close to the target set-point while decreasing the overall response time by up to 52%.},

abstract={A Chatbot is an application that is designed to provide automated contextual communication. Today most chatbots are implemented on top of or as a gateway to popular messaging services, such as Facebook Messenger, Skype and Viber. Chatbots can be classified into many categories regarding their usage, such as conversational commerce, customer support, education, marketing and others. Due to their agile deployment ability on top of virtualized and serverless environments, chatbots are expected to play a pivotal role in the forthcoming 5G networks, which support virtualization capabilities at the edge of the network, making feasible the provision of diversified chatbot services customized to each user needs and requests. However, chatbot QoS might be affected under congested network conditions or in areas with poor signal reception quality. Currently, the performance of the chatbot has not been researched, while the users are experiencing only the results of the potential QoS degradation, such as loss or re-ordering of messages. This paper provides an experimental study of the chatbot apps performance/QoS under different network and reception conditions. The experiment was conducted using the 5G mobile network emulation testbed created and provided by the EU-funded TRIANGLE project.},

abstract={Wind turbines can affect radar systems used for missions in defense, aviation safety, and weather forecasting. Both range and Doppler reflections from wind turbines can create clutter' reduce detection sensitivity, and obscure potential targets. An accurate and up-to-date database of wind turbine locations and status is needed in order to assess their impact on radar functionalities. Overhead and satellite images are important data sources to assess the status of wind turbines. To significantly reduce human workload in classifying the status of wind turbines through overhead imagery, we trained classifiers using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automate the wind turbine status classification problem. We leveraged the existing AlexNet and GoogLeNet CNN frameworks, paired with overhead imagery from Google maps, to train a classifier to determine whether a turbine structure exists at a location where one has been registered. The automated classifier achieved an average accuracy of 97%. Our classifier can act as a highly efficient prefilter to select wind turbines for status verification by human operators.1},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles have rapidly become the air vehicle of choice across many industries in the global market, with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) predicting no less than 4.3 million unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) sold annually by 2020 [1]. The aerospace industry has enjoyed great success in the rapid innovation of aircrafts and automation, but with rapid innovations in new technologies, comes new risks and vulnerabilities. Aviation, unlike many other industries, operates in extremely high-risk environments, with very little thresholds to security breaches. In a world with rapid advances in technology and elevated threats to homeland security from technologically able state and nonstate actors, it becomes an unavoidable obligation on military and civil aviation regulatory bodies to reinforce the need to investigate and assess the security of UAS in conventional and software-defined radio (SDR) cyberphysical UAS architectures, with their corresponding attack vulnerabilities, to ensure the aviation UAS industry is ready to face the many security challenges ahead with a clear security framework for the design and implementation of secure UAS.},

abstract={Air traffic is doubling every 15 years, and aviation systems must modernize to address sustainability challenges. The need to balance capacity, efficiency, safety, and environmental requirements is reflected by the several air traffic management (ATM) and avionics modernization initiatives under way. The major collaborative research programs today are the European Union's Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) project and the United States' Next-Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) led by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Other modernization initiatives include the Collaborative Action for Renovation of Air Traffic Systems in Japan, SIRIUS in Brazil, OneSky in Australia, and similar programs in Canada, China, India, and Russia [1]. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has authorized a globally coordinated plan, published as the Global Air Navigation Plan (GANP) [1], to guide the harmonized implementation of communication, navigation, surveillance, and avionics (CNS+A) enhancements across regions and states. In the CNS+A context, aircraft safety is a shared responsibility between airborne and ground-based resources [1]. Hence, this is a safety challenge requiring changes to the current regulatory framework to properly capture the nature of this shared responsibility and the concept of integrated CNS+A systems. Certification of aircraft and ground equipment (hardware and software) and organizational approvals are essential elements to ensure continued and enhanced safety.},

abstract={Serverless Computing and Function as a Service (FaaS) is gaining traction in cloud-based application architectures used by startups and matured organizations alike. Organizations that are keen to leverage modern technology to gain a disruptive edge, optimal efficiency, advanced agility and save cost are adopting these architectural styles rapidly. Cloud service provider offer and dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources in serverless computing. The serverless architectures allows the developers to focus on business logic exclusively without worrying about preparing the runtime, managing deployment and infrastructure related concerns. FaaS may be assumed as a subset of Serverless Computing, in which, instead of coding a full-fledged cloud based application, the developer just writes (often small) functions which are piece of code (in one of the multiple programming languages supported by the platform) dedicated to do a focused, often single task that are invoked by triggers. It offers dynamic allocation and scaling of the resources and innovative trigger based costing model. This paper introduces Serverless Computing, and Function as a Service (FaaS), explores its advantages and limitations, options available with popular cloud and Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers, and emerging use cases and success stories.},

abstract={With the implementation of the law of independence of distribution companies, a new role in the distribution body as an economic entity, along with other tasks in the service and the provision of stable and reliable electricity to consumers, was formed. Currently, more than a decade, the presence of distribution companies in the electricity market of Iran, accounts for more than 70% of the total costs of the distribution company for the purchase of electricity. Efficient and effective management of the firm is a continuous and dynamic process. Effective implementation of processes involves monitoring performance indicators and adopting and executing management decisions in a timely manner. Assessing performance is one of the important and influential factors in this process that executives accomplish for achieving the goals of the organization. Unfortunately, so far, for the electricity market sector in the distribution companies, performance measurement indicators have not been formulated and reported. In this paper, some of the most important indicators for assessing the technical and economic activities of the electricity market are based on technical knowledge, practical experience, and their effectiveness assessment, which, given their applicability and the results obtained, can be used to solve the electricity market issues in distributed companies.},

abstract={For predictive maintenance of equipment with Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies, existing IoT Cloud systems provide strong monitoring and data analysis capabilities for detecting and predicting status of equipment. However, we need to support complex interactions among different software components and human activities to provide an integrated analytics, as software algorithms alone cannot deal with the complexity and scale of data collection and analysis and the diversity of equipment, due to the difficulties of capturing and modeling uncertainties and domain knowledge in predictive maintenance. In this paper, we describe how we design and augment complex IoT big data cloud systems for integrated analytics of IIoT predictive maintenance. Our approach is to identify various complex interactions for solving system incidents together with relevant critical analytics results about equipment. We incorporate humans into various parts of complex IoT Cloud systems to enable situational data collection, services management, and data analytics. We leverage serverless functions, cloud services, and domain knowledge to support dynamic interactions between human and software for maintaining equipment. We use a real-world maintenance of Base Transceiver Stations to illustrate our engineering approach which we have prototyped with state-of-the art cloud and IoT technologies, such as Apache Nifi, Hadoop, Spark and Google Cloud Functions.},

abstract={In recent years, the waste management and recycling industry has been facing multiple challenges such as protecting the public from harmful hazardous waste, promoting recycling and material source separation into common material streams. For instance, separating waste of hazardous wastes such as paint or batteries can be costly during the source separation process after waste is collected. What is therefore needed is a smart waste management system that is capable of identifying waste materials prior to the separation process. To overcome these challenges and more, we introduce recycle.io, a serverless Internet of Things (IoT) architecture for smart waste management systems. Using recycle.io, it is then possible to determine in real-time the types of source material violations prior to the waste collection. In this manner, waste management systems can identify sources of violations and rectify this by bringing awareness to the public or issuing fines to prevent violations from occurring. We demonstrate usefulness of our approach throughout the paper.},

We propose The Architect, a rule-based system for serverless-microservices based high-level architecture generation. In the process of auto generating serverless-microservices high-level architecture, TheArchitect will preserve the highlighted quality measures. It will also provide a tool based support for the high-level architecture designing process of the software architect. Any software developer will be able to use TheArchitect to generate a proper architecture minimizing the involvement of a software architect. Furthermore, the positives of microservices and serverless technologies have made a significant impact on the software engineering community in terms of shifting from the era of building large monolith applications containing overly complex designs, to microservices and serverless based technologies. Hence The Architect focuses on generating best fitted microservices and serverless based high-level architecture for a given application.},

As a use case, we investigate just in time classification of client uploaded media (e.g., images, videos, etc.) against adult or hateful content. The system architecture is implemented using Spring MVC (Spring Boot) and AlexNet convolutional neural network CNN for image classification. Observed results show up to more than 10x improvements in throughput and energy efficiency depending on the target RNA (FPGA) device and the level of optimization of the employed hardware classifier.},

abstract={Ever-changing situation in the aviation demands a change in flight training programs that would reflect present needs and threats in contrary to the traditional training that didn't changed much for decades. Therefore, new alternative training concepts have been developed that cover these needs. However, these concepts do not apply to initial training which seem to be a crucial phase of a pilot training. Thus, the aim was to create a software solution that would identify individual flight maneuvers and evaluate them so that the overall evaluation would be done by considering objective evaluation and flight instructors' subjective expertise. A study was done with strictly given flight schedules. For the purpose of automatic maneuver detection, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise - DBSCAN clustering algorithm was used, which could determine maneuvers and thus exclude the noise from clusters of maneuvers. The results indicate that the proposed solution was able to identify the prescribed maneuvers with high sensitivity. The solution could be extended in the future to identify all flight maneuvers considering as many parameters from flight data recorder as possible and thus carry out complete objectively based pilot performance evaluation.},

Complete MC/DC is a gold standard for thoroughness of testing. However, it is challenging to generate test cases to achieve high MC/DC as it requires testers to manually conduct complex control flow analysis. In this paper, we propose MCDC-Star, a white-box based automated test case generation technique for achieving high MC/DC coverage criterion using greedy-based symbolic execution. By analyzing the control-flow of the subject program, MCDC-Star generates test cases that can improve the MC/DC efficiently and effectively. An experiment using three industrial programs was conducted, and the results show its high effectiveness and efficiency.},

abstract={Convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved great success in handwriting recognition. However, it relies on large set of labeled data in training and its performance will deteriorate when the data distribution varies. To solve this problem, traditional methods usually consider adaptation of the single top layer of CNN. To better reduce the distribution discrepancy, in this paper, we consider adaptation of all layers of CNN including both convolutional and full layers. Four variations of transformations are designed based on different assumptions about the space relations for adaptation of convolutional layers. In order to make adaptation of multiple layers, we propose to cascade the transformations of different layers to conduct adaptation in a deep manner, and therefore this method is denoted as deep transfer mapping (DTM).

pages={131-134},
abstract={Function as a Service(FaaS) has been widely prevalent in the cloud computing area with the evolution of the cloud computing paradigm and the growing demand for event-based computing models. We have analyzed the preparation load required for the actual execution of a function, from assignment of a function execution walker to loading a function on the FaaS platform, by testing the execution of a dummy function on a simple FaaS prototype. According to the analysis results, we found that the cost of first worker allocation requires 1,850ms even though the lightweight container is used, and then the worker re-allocation cost require 470ms at the same node. The result shows that the function service is not enough to be used as a high efficiency processing calculation platform. We propose a new worker scheduling algorithm to appropriately distribute the worker's preparation load related to execution of functions so that FaaS platform is suitable for high efficiency computing environment. Proposed algorithm is to distribute the worker 's allocation tasks in two steps before the request occurs, and predict the number of workers required to be allocated in advance. When applying the proposed worker scheduling algorithm in FaaS platform under development, we estimate that worker allocation request can be processed with an allocation cost of less than 3% compared to the FaaS prototype. Therefore, it is expected that the functional service will become a high efficiency computing platform through the significant improvement of the worker allocation cost.},

abstract={Serverless computing has recently experienced significant adoption by several applications, especially Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In serverless computing, rather than deploying and managing dedicated virtual machines, users are able to deploy individual functions, and pay only for the time that their code is actually executing. However, since serverless platforms are relatively new, they have a completely different pricing model that depends on the memory, duration, and the number of executions of a sequence/workflow of functions. In this paper we present an algorithm that optimizes the price of serverless applications in AWS Lambda. We first describe the factors affecting price of serverless applications which include: (1) fusing a sequence of functions, (2) splitting functions across edge and cloud resources, and (3) allocating the memory for each function. We then present an efficient algorithm to explore different function fusion-placement solutions and find the solution that optimizes the application's price while keeping the latency under a certain threshold. Our results on image processing workflows show that the algorithm can find solutions optimizing the price by more than 35%-57% with only 5%-15% increase in latency. We also show that our algorithm can find non-trivial memory configurations that reduce both latency and price.},

Our proposed ATC Scenario Training Technology (ASTT) is currently being developed as a Web-based ERAM training tool, designed to provide a recreation of the ERAM's core functionality with the ability to load/create/modify scenarios. The tool will allow for students to select an instructor-provided scenario and switch between the R-Side and EDST contexts in real time. The challenges of designing such a system are mainly constrained to the team development environment, interface design, scenario simulation, and user response processing domains, but the overall architecture needs to be considered closely. This paper reports on the challenges in designing and developing the underlying ASTT software technology as a computationally intensive and multifaceted system, specifically in the domains of the technology stack selection and development environment creation.

abstract={The FAA's NextGen Weather Processor and Common Support Services - Weather programs will enable significantly higher-performance weather product generation and dissemination capabilities than are possible with today's systems. In addition to covering an expanded geographical region, NextGen weather consolidates, improves, and expands terminal and en route weather information using a flexible framework based on standard services and standard data formats. Decision support systems may utilize weather images using Aviation Weather Display functions. NextGen weather services also provide digital data in standardized formats including eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and Network Common Data Form (NetCDF), so it is possible to integrate digital weather data with air traffic information. Such digital integration can be done in parallel using a Big Data framework that enables machine learning to assist in more efficient traffic management. In this paper we present an approach using a Big Data framework to perform data fusion of NextGen weather products with synthetic flight trajectory data. These services combine weather and air traffic information utilizing business rules to estimate weather impact. The paper also discusses other scenarios for use of such data and services in air traffic management.},

pages={1-10},
abstract={The integration of unmanned aircraft into the existing airspace will require reliable automated sensors and systems to ensure safe separation and operationally acceptable guidance. To support this goal, the aviation community is currently developing standards for Detect and Avoid (DAA) systems. In parallel, the Airborne Collision Avoidance System Xu (ACAS Xu) is under development by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as a DAA implementation that provides both Remain-Well-Clear (RWC) and Collision Avoidance (CA) alerting and guidance. The development of requirements for surveillance sensors and systems to support the required levels of safety and operational performance defined by the aviation community necessitate extensive parametric studies to evaluate end-to-end performance across a wide range of potential designs. With a high-dimensional design space, this task becomes intractable due to the computational cost of simulating a large set of encounters for each potential set of design parameters. Additionally, performance of ACAS Xu must be examined in the context of two alerting schemes: CA only and with both CA and RWC alerting. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of surrogate optimization techniques to derive surveillance performance requirements to support both RWC and CA alerting with ACAS Xu. We will illustrate the robustness of the framework for efficiently deriving requirements by performing the process both with and without RWC alerting. Additionally, we will show the ability to incorporate vendor design preferences and additional constraints on the design space imposed by the drafted DAA requirements. The results will substantiate a repeatable, flexible framework for deriving radar surveillance requirements, supporting the development of the ACAS Xu Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) and harmonizing the standards for DAA and CA.},

abstract={The air traffic transformation underway in the US with the FAA NextGen and in Europe with SESAR relies on information sharing and system interoperability to increase efficiencies, safety and capacity. The proliferation and dissemination of flight, weather, aeronautical, and environmental data by all air traffic participants represents a treasure trove of air traffic optimization opportunities awaiting to be exploited. Traditional data exploitation methods and tools tend to rely on structured data stores and analytical capability architected to answer defined and current questions. SGT, in collaboration with the US DOT Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, developed a prototype air transportation cloud based Data Lake to harness big data from a variety of sources and build the current and next generation of analytics capability. The Data Lake prototype ingests data from multiple sources including FAA sources like SFDPS, TFMData, TBFM, STDDS, ITWS, and AEDT data sources, and stores it in raw, processed, and refined format. The prototype offers an illustration for how users can realize powerful air traffic related data analysis using structured, unstructured and semi-structured data using open source tools to execute queries, searches, processing streams and to visualize data. Using a combination of traditional SQL and NOSQL, Open-Source and COTS products - PostgreSQL, Elastic-Logstash-Kibana, Apache Kafka, Apache Spark and visualization tools like Tableau, D3 and others, the project shows how analysts can quickly and easily build powerful data pipelines and statistical models.},

abstract={A whole host of applications for the use of small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have been enabled by new regulation for this class of system. However, much work remains to establish appropriate regulatory infrastructure that allows UAS to operate for commerce over populated areas. The magnitude of that effort is compounded by the wide-ranging variety of UAS types and possible Concepts of Operation (ConOps), as well as the diversity in quality and provenance of UAS components. This paper introduces a case study to investigate hazards posed by a small unmanned rotorcraft operating in proximity to a suburban environment for the purpose of package delivery. A potential mitigation to some of these hazards involves the use of an assured containment system, which is different from a common geofencing application. The proposed assured containment system is expected to reduce the risk posed by the operation, which may then be conducted in compliance with the parameters for operation outlined in 14 CFR Part 107, Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems [1].},

abstract={Traffic Management Initiatives (TMIs), including Ground Delay Programs (GDP) and Collaborative Trajectory Options Programs (CTOP), are tools that air traffic managers use to balance demand and capacity in congested airports and airspace regions. In the current Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) paradigm, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will set the Planned Acceptance Rates (PARs) for the constrained airspace resources, then run resource allocation algorithms to assign ground delays and/or reroutes to affected flights. In this paper, we have addressed a fundamental question in TMI PAR planning: do there exist optimal PARs which only depend on the physical airport or airspace capacity but not the demand? We show that this conjecture holds true in the deterministic capacity case but not in the general stochastic case. Several critical implications of this conclusion are discussed. We propose a new stochastic model and develop a heuristic saturation technique. We demonstrate that this technique can not only reveal the properties and limiting behaviors of GDP models but also could potentially be used as a robust PAR policy when facing demand uncertainty. We then show this ancillary saturation technique in GDP planning becomes an indispensable tool in CTOP optimization. The findings of this paper provide valuable insights in understanding the TMI rate-planning problem and a more robust algorithm for GDP optimization.},

abstract={While most modern commercial airplanes are flown with two pilots, long haul flight operations require augmented flight crews. The normal crew complement conducts the takeoff, climb-out and initial en route segments, additional pilots are on-board. These `relief' pilots will be rested and ready to take over the flying duties later in the flight. Flight duty times and pre- and post-flight rest requirements currently require multiple flight crews per airplane in order to maximize utilization of the airplane. Advances in intelligent systems, airspace modernization, human factors, and data links are raising the possibility of safely and efficiently operating commercial airplanes with reduced flight crews. As applied to long haul commercial flights, such Reduced Crew Operations (RCO) concepts may include periods of flight where there is only one pilot in the cockpit while other pilot(s) are taking prescribed rest periods. In the RCO concept, the normal flight crew complement (for example, captain and first officer) are in the cockpit for critical flight phases such as takeoff and landing and then alternate flying and resting during cruise. In the event of abnormal operations or an in-flight emergency, the resting pilot can be alerted and called to the flight deck. This paper examines the operational and regulation aspects of Reduced Crew Operations. An impact analysis of the applicable US Federal Aviation Regulations, particularly Part 117 Flight and Duty Limitations and Rest Requirements: Flight Crew Members, and Part 121 Operating Requirements: Domestic, Flag, and Supplemental Operations is presented. This paper provides a summary of the research into RCO concept of operations, including research jointly conducted by NASA and Rockwell Collins. Based on the regulation impacts and the studies, this paper identifies the present operational, procedural, and technical challenges that must be addressed to safely implement Reduced Crew Operations.},

abstract={This paper estimates the benefits and costs for an integrated arrival, departure, surface traffic management technology currently under operational evaluation at Charlotte Douglas International Airport. The technology under study is NASA's Airspace Technology Demonstration 2 (ATD-2) system. Using high-fidelity fast-time simulations of current-day operations (including modeling of current-day operational shortfalls) and future ATD-2 operations (including the modeling of associated ATD-2 benefit mechanisms), ATD-2 benefits were projected for three major U.S. airports. Individual airport benefits were then annualized (extrapolated to full year benefits) and nationalized (extrapolated to Core-30 FAA airports), to compute total projected monetary benefits per year. FAA-recommended cost assessment approaches were applied to compute projected ATD-2 implementation costs. Finally, costs were compared against National Airspace System (NAS)-wide benefits, and a projected return on investment was calculated. Our results estimate that the ATD-2 system can provide $2.6 billion in monetary benefits nationwide over the lifecycle of the program due to significant reduction in taxi delay as well as shifting of the delays from taxi to gate. The projected ATD-2 benefits significantly outweigh the projected implementation costs. Incorporation of ATD-2 into the FAA's planned Terminal Flight Data Manager (TFDM) system deployments is estimated to improve the benefit-cost ratio of the TFDM program from an earlier estimated 1.09 to 1.89 over the lifecycle of the program.},

abstract={A Ground Based Detect and Avoid (GBDAA) system, derived from the Terminal Automation Modernization Replacement (TAMR) system, the terminal air traffic control (ATC) automation system currently in use in US National Airspace (NAS) continues to evolve to provide enhanced detect and avoid decision making for unmanned aircraft (UA) operating in the NAS. GBDAA capabilities have been developed as a partnership between the USAF, State of Ohio, DOT Volpe Center, MITRE and Raytheon. The system displays airborne tracks provided by a collection of sensors for situational awareness and proximity alerts to crew and mission planners. Large and small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) operations are supported using both fixed and mobile facilities. The GBDAA system allows the pilot to make decisions about flight maneuvers without using ground observers or chase planes during day and night operations. Recent enhancements include the use of a separate GBDAA Operator (GO) display, synchronized with the UA's Pilot in Command's (PIC) display to allow for the safe passage of the UA throughout its operational airspace. The GO supports the PIC with alert prioritization and maneuver recommendations, allowing the PIC to focus on piloting tasks and reduce the time needed for avoidance maneuvers. Several types of UAS operations are described that include: · Table top sUAS operations at a small airfield · Medium sized unmanned aircraft (UA) Ground Control Systems (GCS) such as those used for Predators/Reapers and mobile cart technology. · Larger UAS operations such as those used for the Global Hawk with a separate mission operations center · Airspace utilization, such as transit corridor operations, transition from terminal operations to Class A airspace, and free flight considerations The availability of surveillance coverage and the size of the UAS operational airspace that can be supported can be determined based on available surveillance assets and airspace environment at each location. In many cases, existing surveillance assets are used to provide the information needed on the airspace being monitored. New radar equipment and modifications to existing surveillance assets can be used to augment existing ATC sensors and close surveillance coverage gaps. GBDAA decision making is provided by new software and the use of multisensor fusion tracking software that supports the display of track information for both cooperative and noncooperative targets. These are displayed to both the GO and PIC using a common situation display showing the operational airspace. Several ever increasingly urgent levels of proximity alerts are displayed to both flight crew members as they perform their respective tasks. This paper describes important aspects of the development of a mobile facility as the team integrated access to FAA surveillance radar assets, radio and telecommunications gear to create a complete set of GBDAA services that can be installed at different sites. The necessary airport field work, integration of surveillance, radio and phone connections and the installation of a fully functional GBDAA system into a 36-foot modified recreational vehicle is described. This “GBDAA Bus” provides a working environment to support operations for sUAS stakeholders carrying out different missions for both AFRL and the State of Ohio's UAS Center. Where no access is available to certified FAA/DoD airport surveillance and long-range radar sensors, several different types of towable sensors can be used, some even offering elevation approximation for non-cooperative targets.},

To ensure safe access for all stakeholders the Federal Aviation Administration has established regulations for hobbyist and commercial operators of UAVs, partially supplemented with concurrent guidelines for hobbyist from the Academy of Model Aeronautics. Initially, many of the regulations regarding UAVs sought to maintain current safety standards by ensuring air traffic segregation between manned and unmanned aircraft. That said, much of the ongoing regulation development has occurred without data and evidence-driven practices; regulators have based decisions without accurate knowledge of the real-world usage of UAVs. In an attempt to support ongoing regulation and policy development this initial study reports statistics regarding pilot observance of UAV regulations and guidelines when performing mapping operations. Over 168,000 UAV trajectories, representing real-world UAV mapping operations, are analyzed to determine if pilots likely maintained visualline-of-sight, and followed 400 ft altitude guidelines and airspace restrictions. While global variations are noted, UAV pilots performing mapping operations within the United States are observed to widely comply with regulations. Troubling however, the analysis indicates that the small group of UAV pilots exceeding altitude regulations are much more likely to break other regulations as well, thereby increasing the risk of interaction with manned aircraft.},

abstract={There is an increasing demand for the FAA to allow small UAS (sUAS) operations in the US national airspace system. The FAA must understand and quantify the risk of collisions with manned aircraft during desired sUAS operations in order to produce regulations and standards. The FAA has made extensive use of Monte Carlo collision risk analysis simulations in developing standards for manned aircraft collision avoidance systems, as well as separation standards and Detect and Avoid systems for large UAS. Similar Monte Carlo simulations are desired for use in collision risk simulations for sUAS operations and system development. A key component of Monte Carlo simulations are models of aircraft flight. Models for manned aircraft are developed from recorded radar data. These manned aircraft models are modified to model large UAS which fly in similar ways. However, new methods are needed to model sUAS flights since there is no corresponding dataset of flights, and their flight capabilities are significantly different from manned aircraft. We demonstrate a methodology for developing sUAS flight models that leverages OpenStreetMap, an open source geospatial information and map dataset, to generate representative unmanned operations at low altitudes for use in Monte Carlo collision risk simulations. For example we model rail line inspection flights by following rail lines, and hobbyist flights by locating parks and other recreational sites. We automatically identify geographic locations of interest for various use cases, and generate appropriate associated transit, search, and hover trajectories for different sUAS performance dynamics and cruise altitudes. We leverage the map data to identify potential variations in operational density.},

abstract={In every avionics system, Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components play an important role by enabling more complex functions. Even in safety-critical systems, COTS hardware components are ubiquitous nowadays. Since the avionics manufacturer do not develop the COTS components themselves, traditional avionics Development Assurance (DA) methods cannot be used. Instead other assurance strategies are used. The problem is that the complexity of the COTS components continuously increase and that several different types COTS components exist, each requiring different assurance strategies. This article includes a literature review over Certification Authority (CA) materials and research reports over COTS hardware components certification related documents since the early 1990s. We then contribute by an approach that can structure this material to provide an overview on COTS assurance methods or activities through an assurance case. The early results show that assurance cases are a possible way to argument COTS assurance and that these cases reveal interconnections between the assurance methods and as such contribute to the overall goal of increased confidence in using COTS components.},

abstract={Through development of a MITRE-funded prototype tool, we have demonstrated the feasibility of applying machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to help aviation regulatory agencies more efficiently, consistently, and effectively analyze requests to operate unmanned aircraft consistent with a complex set of operating rules and regulations. The prototype, called ARDeST (Application Review Decision Support Tool), uses NLP models derived from machine learning to aid in reviewing large numbers of applications requesting waivers or exemptions from existing aviation regulations. The prototype attempts to predict the likely decision outcome for each pending application, thereby helping agencies to triage incoming requests. It then provides decision support to the individual regulatory reviewer by identifying and highlighting key decision features that relate to issues that must be addressed for regulatory approval. All of the automated analyses are associated with confidence metrics derived from the underlying statistical machine learning algorithms employed, which can help decision makers in their prioritization and review process. By highlighting decisional factors and the sentences or paragraphs in which they are addressed, reviewers are able to focus principally on the most important material. This tool increases efficiency, reduces the cognitive load on the reviewer, and enables rapid decision making.},

abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) have an emerging interest in ontologies. A common ontology for avionics analytics can help pilots and Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) make difficult decisions with increasingly-sophisticated avionics, densely-occupied airspaces, and progressively-adverse weather. The connected airspace sets a context of big data, enriched features, and information uncertainty. This paper proposes to endow an Avionics Analytics Ontology (AAO) with semantic uncertainty to improve decision-making capabilities. The proposed approach incorporates the Uncertainty Representation and Reasoning Evaluation Framework (URREF) into the AAO for input information. The AAO focuses on veracity as a key component of information credibility to deal with uncertainty. The URREF assessment aims to enhance avionics analytics when considering semantic and physical data sources. Thus, situation AWareness (SAW) and Situation Assessment (SA) as well as Situation Understanding (SU) in information fusion are ultimately enhanced by means of statistical metrics of veracity. This paper also shows experimental results from two application scenarios. Concluding remarks and future research directions are also presented.},

pages={1-10},
abstract={To address the Integrated Arrival, Departure, and Surface (IADS) challenge, NASA is developing and demonstrating trajectory-based departure automation under a collaborative effort with the FAA and industry known as Airspace Technology Demonstration 2 (ATD-2). ATD-2 builds upon and integrates previous NASA research capabilities that include the Spot and Runway Departure Advisor (SARDA), the Precision Departure Release Capability (PDRC), and the Terminal Sequencing and Spacing (TSAS) capability. The ATD-2 field demonstration is organized into three phases. Phase I illustrates a Baseline IADS demonstration and includes all components of ATD-2 running in operational environments. Subsequent phases will fuse together strategic scheduling components as well as take into account metroplex considerations. This paper describes the baseline IADS system that was deployed at the end of 2017 and is continuing to run as part of the ATD-2 demonstration taking place at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport (CLT). The primary areas of deployment and system use are in the CLT Air Traffic Control Tower, CLT TRACON, CLT American Airlines ramp tower, Washington Center facility and American Airlines Integration Operations Center (IOC). In addition to describing the functions and capabilities that are part of the baseline IADS system, this paper also provides metrics regarding operational use as well as initial benefits metrics. Benefit metrics continue to be collected and aggregated across the areas of system delay, throughput, taxi time, fuel burn savings, and emissions savings. Furthermore, benefits as a result of common awareness of delays and the impact of takeoff and departure restrictions stemming from traffic flow management initiatives are described. The overall benefit of improved predictability and efficiency as a result of the baseline IADS system demonstration is also discussed.},

pages={1-8},
abstract={Currently the aerospace community is faced with both challenges and opportunities in addressing safety in systems, software, and hardware. These challenges and opportunities include; : Increasing technology and environmental complexity making it difficult to assess for safety under current practices, : Regulatory guidance that is not adequately agile to keep up with the pace of innovations, : Shrinking budgets with pressure to do more with fewer resources, : Increasing global competition since aviation products are being designed, developed and fielded by more countries in the world, and : Opportunities to make use of advancing technology to increase safety by managing complexity. To create a more flexible, efficient, and safer system, certification authorities worldwide are transforming oversight based on transactions to oversight based on collaboration and shared risk. The aviation industry is also transforming to more self-guided responsibilities. The applicant and the regulators have begun a transition to a state which has progressively less direct involvement of the regulators in the compliance activities of the applicant. One of the foundational cultural, technical and business decisions to assuring avionics is the proper application of standards. This will result in safer equipment and afford the applicant a means to demonstrate maturity in safety-culture with measurable continuous improvement. Though currently applicants strive to increase maturity in compliance activities, these efforts are distinct within each applicant organization, appear to be ad hoc from an external perspective, and are not always measured. Such internal maturity indicators could be used for deriving the value-added level of regulatory oversight. Regulatory oversight in the transformed state needs to be intelligently customized to the level needed for the project to provide value and to preserve safety. The FAA currently uses some measures for estimating the proper level of project involvement using numerous factors, one of which is the applicant maturity in the accountability framework. Current assessment of maturity is not always supported by data. This paper proposes a method to sharpen value-added oversight, using software compliance as an example, to measure and demonstrate maturity via mindful application of standards (RTCA/DO-178B/C, RTCA/DO-278/A, RTCA/DO-254). This method is based on principles of the Capability Maturity Model, manufacturing quality, critical characteristics, key characteristics, and monitoring to find non-conforming parts, non-conforming tools, and non-conforming processes. These methods are superimposed on the idea of a software experience factory. This paper further gives examples of the types of question to ask with the focus on improving the tools, processes, and people. The applicant could use this method irrespective of the organizational standard practices to demonstrate the organizational safety culture and accountability. This method also makes a business case for increased product quality, increased work efficiency, increased job satisfaction, and better control over schedules because of de creased regulatory involvement.},

abstract={Understanding aviation transportation infrastructure system behavior and coupling with communication networks is essential for securing and restoring functionality against cyber-enabled threats. While significant progress has been made in the past decade on developing infrastructure resilience theories based on network structure and operations, translating and generalizing them to real-world practice has often been challenging due to imperfect data and inapplicability of modeling assumptions. These typically include: 1) stylized network structures without uncertainty, 2) node homogeneity, 3) static criticality measures, and 4) unrealistic cascade models originating from single points of failure. This paper presents the modeling perspectives and approaches that aim to address these theory-to-practice challenges using a well-grounded network-of-networks (NoN) construct. Real-world modeling challenges are identified and a network theory-guided conceptual NoN model is developed that may be operationalized with the U.S. national airspace system airport network and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) communication network as an application domain.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are getting closer to becoming ubiquitous in everyday life. Among them, Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have seen an outburst of attention recently, specifically in the area with a demand for autonomy. A key challenge standing in the way of making MAVs autonomous is that researchers lack the comprehensive understanding of how performance, power, and computational bottlenecks affect MAV applications. MAVs must operate under a stringent power budget, which severely limits their flight endurance time. As such, there is a need for new tools, benchmarks, and methodologies to foster the systematic development of autonomous MAVs. In this paper, we introduce the MAVBench' framework which consists of a closed-loop simulator and an end-to-end application benchmark suite. A closed-loop simulation platform is needed to probe and understand the intra-system (application data flow) and inter-system (system and environment) interactions in MAV applications to pinpoint bottlenecks and identify opportunities for hardware and software co-design and optimization. In addition to the simulator, MAVBench provides a benchmark suite, the first of its kind, consisting of a variety of MAV applications designed to enable computer architects to perform characterization and develop future aerial computing systems. Using our open source, end-to-end experimental platform, we uncover a hidden, and thus far unexpected compute to total system energy relationship in MAVs. Furthermore, we explore the role of compute by presenting three case studies targeting performance, energy and reliability. These studies confirm that an efficient system design can improve MAV's battery consumption by up to 1.8X.},

abstract={Personal assistant using a human operator need some time to process single request such as ticket booking, ordering something, and get services. One request can contain many queries for some information provided on the internet. Business performance values time efficiency so must be considered an alternative way to take request. Chatbot can give 24 hours service which can become an advantage besides using a human personal assistant. Chatbot acts like routing agent that can classify user context in conversation. Chatbot helped with natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the request and extract some keyword information. One important process in NLP is morphological analysis and part of speech (POS) tagging. POS help to parse the meaning of chat text based on a set of rules. The rule base is specific to some language and designed to capture all the keyword relies on chat text. Keyword in booking conversation term is like departure and destination city and also the date of flight. There is a variation from a user determining city and date. NLP in booking confirmation has a task to analyze various pattern describing ordering requests like city and date. Messenger bot would be an example of assistance that can help user connected to many services some like ticketing service through conversation interaction. The contribution of this research is to conduct some scenario that happening in ordering tickets.

abstract={A novel method is proposed to compensate the three-phase unbalanced currents of power grid under three-phase unbalanced load for a two-stage photovoltaic (PV) power system without the augmentation of active power filter. The PV power system is composed of an interleaved DC/DC converter and a three-level neutral-point clamped (NPC) inverter. Moreover, the PV power system possesses the smart inverter function, in which the output active and reactive powers of the PV inverter are predetermined by a power factor according to grid codes of the utilities. In the proposed method, dq0-axis compensation currents are obtained through low pass filters to compensate the three-phase unbalanced currents of power grid. Furthermore, in order to improve the control performance of the DC bus voltage of the PV power system under unbalanced load variation condition, an online trained compensatory neural fuzzy network with an asymmetric membership function (CFNN-AMF) is proposed to replace the traditional PI controller for the DC bus voltage control. In the proposed CFNN-AMF, the compensatory parameter to integrate pessimistic and optimistic operations of fuzzy systems is embedded in the CFNN. Finally, excellent compensation performance for the three-phase currents of power grid under three-phase unbalanced load can be achieved from the experimental results.},

abstract={The IoT area has grown significantly in the last few years and is expected to reach a gigantic amount of 50 billion devices by 2020. The appearance of serverless architectures, specifically highlighting FaaS, raises the question of the suitability of using them in IoT environments. Combining IoT with a serverless architectural design can effective when trying to make use of local processing power that exists in a local network of IoT devices and creating a fog layer that leverages computational capabilities that are closer to the end-user. In this approach, which is placed between the device and the serverless function, when a device requests for the execution of a serverless function will decide based on previous metrics of execution if the serverless function should be executed locally, in the fog layer of a local network of IoT devices, or if it should be executed remotely, in one of the available cloud servers. Therefore, this approach allows dynamically allocating functions to the most suitable layer.},

abstract={Recent advancements in virtualization and software architecture have led to the new paradigm of serverless computing, which allows developers to deploy applications as stateless functions without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Accordingly, a serverless platform handles the lifecycle, execution and scaling of the actual functions; these need to run only when invoked or triggered by an event. Thus, the major benefits of serverless computing are low operational concerns and efficient resource management and utilization. Serverless computing is currently offered by several public cloud service providers. However, there are certain limitations on the public cloud platforms, such as vendor lock-in and restrictions on the computation of the functions. Open source serverless frameworks are a promising solution to avoid these limitations and bring the power of serverless computing to on-premise deployments. However, these frameworks have not been evaluated before. Thus, we carry out a comprehensive feature comparison of popular open source serverless computing frameworks. We then evaluate the performance of selected frameworks: Fission, Kubeless and OpenFaaS. Specifically, we characterize the response time and ratio of successfully received responses under different loads and provide insights into the design choices of each framework.},

abstract={High‐altitude nuclear electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) has been recognized as a threat to electrical and electronic equipment since the early 1960s. This chapter describes the phenomenon of HEMP, the effect it has on aircraft, and the methods used for hardening and testing hardened aircraft. An external coupling (EM) wave will induce currents and charges onto the external surface of the aircraft. An aircraft can be in several different EM coupling configurations during its mission: in‐flight, ground alert, in‐flight refueling, or with a trailing wire antenna extended. In a HEMP‐hardened aircraft, the system specification is written in terms of a design margin, which is the ratio of the maximum HEMP‐induced cable currents to the minimum equipment immunity at each cable connector interface. HEMP simulator hardness verification testing is conducted in 3 phases including an active system test, a passive system test, and a direct drive test.},

abstract={PANOSE is a system for classifying and matching typefaces based on their design features. It composes of 10 digits where each digit represents a specific design feature. It uses in several font management tools as option for ordering and searching fonts regarding their design features. Also, it uses in font replacement process when an application or an operating system detects a missing font in an immigrant document or website. Currently, PANOSE is only defined for fonts that have Latin characters. In this paper, a new model is defined to extend PANOSE coverage to include Arabic characters. The reliability of the model has been evaluated by conducting two clustering processes for 30 fonts of Naskh style. Our model, PANOSE-A, is used to measure a similarity matrix for one clustering process while the other process used a similarity matrix produced by using font matching tool. The Silhouette coefficient for both clustering was calculated, giving 97.6 with the font matching tool and 96.6 with PANOSE-A, which indicate the validity and consistency of the results.},

abstract={The serverless computing paradigm brings multiple benefits to application developers who are interested in consuming computing resources as services without the need to manage physical capacities or limits. There are several deployment technologies and languages available suitable for deploying applications to a single cloud provider. However, for multi-cloud application deployments, multiple technologies have to be used and orchestrated. In addition, the event-driven nature of serverless computing imposes further requirements on modeling such application structures in order to automate their deployment. In this paper, we tackle these issues by introducing an event-driven deployment modeling approach using the standard Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) that fully employs the suggested standard lifecycle to provision and manage multi-cloud serverless applications. To show the feasibility of our approach, we extended the existing TOSCA-based ecosystem OpenTOSCA.},

abstract={Annotation systems provide services that vary from adding simple information for signifying content of interest, to indicate patterns in documents for creating statistical models and applying machine learning techniques. In this paper, we argue that AI mechanisms should be part of the annotation process to collaborate with annotation systems' end users (i.e. annotators) as oppose to be just an outcome from annotators' work. Indeed, current systems do not delve into AI aspects to support the annotation process, lacking features that we argue as essential in annotation systems. That is, collaboration between annotators and AI, collaborative knowledge curation by extracting and structuring knowledge from annotations considering the context of annotation anchors (i.e. area that was selected to create an annotation and comprises the content of interest). To illustrate the gains of this approach, we present HAS, the Hyperknowledge Annotation System. HAS allows one to annotate multimedia content (e.g., text, image, and video) and its tight integration with AI-based services enables the extraction of additional semantic information from the annotated content. In our approach, both the annotation and the information extracted from the content are structured using the hyperknowledge conceptual model, which promotes the use of the spatiotemporal query capabilities of this model for retrieving annotations based on semantic queries. We argue that integrating AI-based services and using the hyperknowledge model for knowledge structuring leverage multimedia annotation systems, enabling the development of novel use cases.},

In this regard, the three major production services are currently Amazon Step Functions (December 2016), Azure Durable Functions (June 2017), and IBM Composer (October 2017), still young and experimental projects with a long way ahead. In this article, we will compare and analyze these three serverless orchestration systems under a common evaluation framework.

abstract={Serverless, otherwise known as "Function-as-a-Service" (FaaS), is a compelling evolution of cloud computing that is highly scalable and event-driven. Serverless applications are composed of multiple independent functions, each of which can be implemented in a range of programming languages. This paper seeks to understand the impact of the choice of language runtime on the performance and subsequent cost of serverless function execution. It presents the design and implementation of a new serverless performance testing framework created to analyse performance and cost metrics for both AWS Lambda and Azure Functions. For optimum performance and cost management of serverless applications, Python is the clear choice on AWS Lambda. C# .NET is the top performer and most economical option for Azure Functions. NodeJS on Azure Functions and .NET Core 2 on AWS should be avoided or at the very least, used carefully in order to avoid their potentially slow and costly start-up times.},

abstract={Serverless computing is a new computing paradigm that promises to revolutionize the way applications are built and provisioned. In this computing kind, small pieces of software called functions are deployed in the cloud with zero administration and minimal costs for the software developer. Further, this computing kind has various applications in areas like image processing and scientific computing. Due to the above advantages, the current uptake of serverless computing is being addressed by traditional big cloud providers like Amazon, who offer serverless platforms for serverless application deployment and provisioning. However, as in the case of cloud computing, such providers attempt to lock-in their customers with the supply of complementary services which provide added-value support to serverless applications. To this end, to resolve this issue, serverless frameworks have been recently developed. Such frameworks either abstract away from serverless platform specificities, or they enable the production of a mini serverless platform on top of existing clouds. However, these frameworks differ in various features that do have an impact on the serverless application lifecycle. To this end, to assist the developers in selecting the most suitable framework, this paper attempts to review these frameworks according to a certain set of criteria that directly map to the application lifecycle. Further, based on the review results, some remaining challenges are supplied, which when confronted will make serverless frameworks highly usable and suitable for the handling of both serverless as well as mixed application kinds.},

The model of computation that the serverless is imposing is as flexible as it is hard to manage and grasp. We present a novel approach towards serverless computing that tightly integrates it with the visual-textual, functional programming language: Luna. This way we are hoping to achieve the clarity and cognitive ease of visual solutions while retaining the flexibility and expressive power of textual programming languages.

abstract={Function as a Service (FaaS) is a young and rapidly evolving cloud paradigm. Due to its hardware abstraction, inherent virtualization problems come into play and need an assessment from the FaaS point of view. Especially avoidance of idling and scaling on demand cause a lot of container starts and as a consequence a lot of cold starts for FaaS users. The aim of this paper is to address the cold start problem in a benchmark and investigate influential factors on the duration of the perceived cold start. We conducted a benchmark on AWS Lambda and Microsoft Azure Functions with 49500 cloud function executions. Formulated as hypotheses, the influence of the chosen programming language, platform, memory size for the cloud function, and size of the deployed artifact are the dimensions of our benchmark. Cold starts on the platform as well as the cold starts for users were measured and compared to each other. Our results show that there is an enormous difference for the overhead the user perceives compared to the billed duration. In our benchmark, the average cold start overheads on the user's side ranged from 300ms to 24s for the chosen configurations.},

abstract={Serverless computing platforms provide Function(s)-as-a-Service (FaaS) to end users while promising reduced hosting costs, high availability, fault tolerance, and dynamic elasticity for hosting individual functions known as microservices. Serverless Computing environments abstract infrastructure management including creation of virtual machines (VMs), containers, and load balancing from users. To conserve cloud server capacity and energy, cloud providers allow serverless computing infrastructure to go COLD, deprovisioning hosting infrastructure when demand falls, freeing capacity to be harnessed by others. In this paper, we present on a case study migration of the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS), a Java-based environmental modeling application to the AWS Lambda serverless platform. We investigate performance and cost implications of memory reservation size, and evaluate scaling performance for increasing concurrent workloads. We then investigate the use of Keep-Alive workloads to preserve serverless infrastructure to minimize cold starts and ensure fast performance after idle periods for up to 100 concurrent client requests. We show how Keep-Alive workloads can be generated using cloud-based scheduled event triggers, enabling minimization of costs, to provide VM-like performance for applications hosted on serverless platforms for a fraction of the cost.},

abstract={Addressing environmentally safe management of waste is becoming increasingly a challenging task. The predicament of the rate at which waste is generated due to increasing populations is also contributing to this challenge. One possible approach for effectively handling waste can be achieved by source reduction and recycling. The problem, however, improving the collection of waste can be costly particularly during the source separation process after waste is collected. It would be desirable if there exists a mechanism that can help municipalities, local governments or waste management companies to monitor in real-time sources of violations prior to the waste collection process. In this paper, we introduce recycle.io, an Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled waste management system that is based on a serverless architecture that can identify these sources of violations. Using recycle.io, it is then possible to track the violations geographically which can help local governments, for example, to improve or enforce tighter regulations for waste disposal. Our recycle.io system uses Microsoft Azure IoT Hub for device management. Throughout the paper, we demonstrate usefulness of using our approach for urban waste management in smart cities.},

abstract={Ridge regression is a regularization technique that can be used together with other regression algorithms to model highly correlated data. Like many other traditional techniques, ridge regression of big data version requires a large number of iterations over the dataset to converge. As the dataset cannot all be stored in memory, the dataset is split into RAM-accommodable subsets for training, however, this strategy is time-consuming for reading all subsets from hard drive to memory over and over. To overcome the memory barrier, we proposed to use working sufficient statistics to solve the problem [1]. The parameters of the working sufficient matrix is small enough to be stored in RAM all the time. They can be updated at per row level to allow online computation. This strategy only requires one iteration over the dataset. While our previous work proved its theoretical correctness, it was not clear how our innovative algorithm would work in practice. In this study, we aims to validate and evaluate the performance improvement of the algorithm we proposed in earlier work-Three sets of experiments were conducted using large data-sets published by FAA and BTS to examine the computation time, memory requirement, and the accuracy of the output. Results showed that our exact ridge aggression algorithm enjoyed many benefits, such as faster computing time, minimal memory requirements and more accurate estimates.},

abstract={Serverless computing, or Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), is emerging as a popular alternative model to on-demand cloud computing. Function services are executed by a FaaS provider; a client no longer uses cloud infrastructure directly as in traditional cloud consumption. Is serverless computing a feasible and beneficial approach to big data processing, regarding performance, scalability, and cost effectiveness? In this paper, we explore this research question using matrix multiplication as example. We define requirements for the design of serverless big data applications, present a prototype for matrix multiplication using FaaS, and discuss and synthesize insights from results of extensive experimentation. We show that serverless big data processing can lower operational and infrastructure costs without compromising system qualities; serverless computing can even outperform cluster-based distributed compute frameworks regarding performance and scalability.},

pages={4501-4507},
abstract={Saving nature using Big Data Analytics is a very noble goal. Using New York taxi rides data, we decided to learn how many rides could be consolidated. It was a journey we would like to share. First, we had to choose the platform for calculation between Amazon Athena, Serverless Microservices, SQL or NoSql databases, Hadoop and Spark. Then, we had to find an optimal solution for the platform using assorted tuning and optimization techniques. Although the problem seems to be straight forward, it turned out that the solution is quite challenging because of the input size, data quality, calculation complexities and numerous EMR/Spark tuning options. We have been using New York taxi data from 2009 to 2017 to quantify the rides that can be joined together. The taxi rides were consolidated based on pickup location, pickup time and drop-off location. We have been calculating the percentage of taxi rides that can be joined. The benchmark originally set was rides within five minutes with a pickup and drop-off locations within half a kilometer. Then we started experimenting with different times and locations. We have been using parquet format, parallel Scala collections, compression, filtering, new column introduction, tuning parameters, I/O overhead tuning, bucketing, timeouts and partitioning. Over 1.2 billion rides were processed using Amazon EMR with Spark. We have been optimizing calculation time and processing price. Spark has hundreds of parameters, EMR has over fifty instances to choose from. It was challenging to process our data within reasonable time. We were able to find the optimal Spark queries (plans), tested different types of joins and compared their performances. Also, we were able to compare I/O and in-memory operations during partitioning and large files manipulation (the input file sizes were hundreds of Gigabytes). The results were amazing - we could consolidate around thirty five percent of total rides, saving tons of gas and improving environment and traffic in New York City.},

year={2018},

pages={708-717},
abstract={In cloud, many different service frameworks with new concepts such as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), Serverless, and Stateless emerge recently. They are essentially certain instantiations of Micro-Service architecture, in which, a software application is implemented as a set of "loosely-coupled services" [32]. From design perspective, these services are considered as the most fine-grained units implementing business logics. Existing frameworks mostly focus on deployment and management of Micro-Services in cloud. However, the internal management within Micro-Service at thread level and function level does not attract enough attention. These missing pieces are critical for telecom applications, in term of programming model, scalability and performance. In this paper, we present Lite-Service, a new framework addressing device, edge and cloud operation environments in telecom industry. It adopts FaaS, Serverless and Stateless programming models to separate telecom logics from runtimes in order to improve development efficiency and reduce operation cost. The Lite-Service framework features 2 additional runtimes: function-level runtime for complex telecom function scheduling; thread-level intra-service runtime for fast response to load change. An autonomous self-adaptive scheduler and decentralized service management schemes are proposed to enhance performance and service adaptability in different telecom deployment scenarios. Empirical results show that the Lite-Service framework is effective for building and scheduling telecom applications in device, edge and cloud.},

abstract={Serverless is the new generation of cloud services that supports the pay-per-use policy in true spirit by charging only for the execution time of the hosted code. Amazon introduced serverless service of Lambda in 2014 and it is consider as the most popular serverless cloud service till date. This paper focuses on the serverless cloud services of Lambda and elaborates the importance of Lambda based serverless cloud services for hosting the disaster management information systems (DMIS). We have identified two repeatedly occurring phases of the life cycle of a DMIS. These phases are high activity phase and low activity phase. Our findings state that serverless cloud services are well-suited for both of these phases of a DMIS. Serverless reduce the operational cost during the low activity phase by detaching the code from running containers and it improves the scalability during the high activity phase by quickly assigning the already available containers from the container pool. However, this all comes with the price of reduced QoS for initial requests and our experimental results reflect the extent of this quality degradation.},

abstract={Blood vessel segmentation helps to know the progress of the disease during diagnosis. The presence of intensity in-homogeneity, conglutination tissue and noise in medical images has led to difficulty in extraction of different sizes of blood vessels, difficulty in separating vessels for further analysis (such as quantification of angiogenesis), difficulty in distinguishing vessels from non vessels. Most of the available techniques are 2D-based. Despite the fact that 2D-based segmentation is easy, it doesn't provide full information about anatomic structure. Most of the available 3D vessel segmentation techniques require human intervention and fail to segment different sizes of vessels. In this paper, a 3D hybrid approach for segmentation has been developed, based on white top hat scale space bilateral hessian vessel enhancement filter and hysteresis threshold method combined with multi-threshold Otsu method. The hybrid method can address noise and intensity in-homogeneity problem, as a result, more vessels of different sizes are detected. The method can also incorporate spatial information, abnormalities in the vessels are detected. Vessels of different sizes are separated to ease further analysis. Conglutination tissue (that obstruct segmentation process) is eliminated to ease extraction of different sizes of vessels.},

Fifty-six healthy young adults participated in this study, which involves a set of stress stimulus tasks and EEG recordings. Discrete Wavelet Transformation has been used to extract alpha wave from raw EEG data and then the widely used Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA) was calculated to evaluate the stress state. Statistical results show that Frontal Alpha Asymmetry index obtained in classical music group has a significant difference if compared to personal preferred group and control group (rest in silence), indicating that classical music is a more effective tool for mental stress relief. Regarding the timing settings to listen to the music, there is not a statistical difference, indicating that listening to music before, during and after the stressful events has no significant relief effect.},

In June 2016, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) released the operational rules for routine commercial use of small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), which is anticipated to further spur the growth of the global UAV industry in the coming years. To unlock the full potential of UAVs to enable large-scale usage, it is imperative to develop innovative wireless communication technologies, not only for supporting the critical control and non-payload communications (CNPC) to ensure the safe operation of all UAVs, but also for enabling the high-capacity payload data transmissions for various rate-demanding applications. Integrating UAVs into fi fth generation (5G) (and beyond) cellular systems is a promising technology to achieve the above goals.},

abstract={This work deals with the development of a station for measuring hydro-meteorological parameters from large water reservoirs. It allows data to be collected, stored and automatically transmitted to a web server. These data is needed to calibrate numerical models that help in the characterization of the different lakes of the Province of Córdoba, Argentina; today under increasing eutrophication risk. The station measures meteorological parameters on the lake's surface using sensors for wind speed and direction, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure and solar radiation. Under water, in the first prototype, it is possible to measure temperature at different depths using a chain of thermal sensors, with the goal of determining the presence of vertical gradients of temperature, thermal stratification, thermocline depth, upwelling, vertical mixing, etc. It is foreseen for the evolution of the system to include dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, ORP, and total dissolved solids sensors. The telemetry system is a GSM/GPRS device that uses the local cellular network. In addition, there is an alternative wireless device for backup in case of failure of the primary telemetry system or unavailability of the cellular network. The station is self-powered by a photovoltaic and battery system. This work presents preliminary results obtained in laboratory tests, prior to the installation of the prototype.},

abstract={ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) is a cooperative surveillance technology in which an aircraft determines its position through satellite navigation and issues it periodically, which allows tracking. The information can be received by the ground stations of air traffic control as a complement to the secondary radar system that does not need to receive a signal from the ground to emit. It can also be received by other aircraft to allow knowledge of the situation and allow self-separation. The ADS-B is automatic in that it does not require any pilot action or external input and is in turn dependent, which depends on the data of the navigation system of the aircraft. ADS-B equipment are currently mandatory parts in parts of Australia's airspace, while in the United States and Europe they are part of the aircraft that own these devices by the year 2020. Argentina is governed by ICAO regulations (International Civil Aviation) Organization) and the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) of the United States, which implies the same application times in Argentina. This paper explains the development of a receiving earth station system and decoder of the ADS-B system using an embedded platform, combining COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) and associated software components. An OrangePI+ board, an SDR-RTL-2832U receiver and a LoRa transceiver were used to distribute the information to remote stations for further processing and visualization in a distributed manner.},

abstract={Communication networks need to be both adaptive and scalable. The last few years have seen an explosive growth of software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) to address this need. Both technologies help enable networking software to be decoupled from the hardware so that software functionality is no longer constrained by the underlying hardware and can evolve independently. Both SDN and NFV aim to advance a software-based approach to networking, where networking functionality is implemented in software modules and executed on a suitable cloud computing platform. Achieving this goal requires the virtualization paradigm used in these services that play an important role in the transition to software-based networks. Consequently, the corresponding computing platforms accompanying the virtualization technologies need to provide the required agility, robustness, and scalability for the services executed. Serverless computing has recently emerged as a new paradigm in virtualization and has already significantly changed the economics of offloading computations to the cloud. It is considered as a low-latency, resource-efficient, and rapidly deployable alternative to traditional virtualization approaches, such as those based on virtual machines and containers. Serverless computing provides scalability and cost reduction, without requiring any additional configuration overhead on the part of the developer. In this paper, we explore and survey how serverless computing technology can help building adaptive and scalable networks and show the potential pitfalls of doing so.},

abstract={Drones are estimated to play a critical role in the smart city, assisting with a variety of use cases: medical, transportation and agriculture. The applications of drones in the smart city will involve multiple drone platforms that operate simultaneously to run missions. Therefore, the safe and secure environment for drones' operational quality and stability is necessary. It is also essential for governments to implement regulations to enforce safe security standards and disallow the implementation of weak cybersecurity measures in live environments. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) predicted that 30,000 drones could be flying in U.S. skies in less than 20 years. The investigation of the drone traffic safety and development of the intelligent transportation system needs drone-following models, which describes the one-by-one following process of drones in the traffic flow. There are two types of drone-following models that are proposed and discussed in this paper. The first models based on the principle that keeps a safe distance according to relative velocity, which based on the determining of the drone acceleration depending on the differences in speeds and gaps between the given drone and its leading drone. Another model is the Markov drone-following model which is improved model based on the approximation of the stochastic diffusion process of speed decision. The simulation results show that the changes in velocities of the following drones are nearly the same as leading one.},

abstract={Blockchain technologies and smart contracts are becoming mainstream research fields in computer science and researchers are continuously investigating new frontiers for new applications. Likewise, microservices are getting more and more popular in the latest years thanks to their properties, that allow teams to slice existing information systems into small and independent services that can be developed independently by different teams. A symmetric paradigm applies to smart contracts as well, which represent well defined, usually isolated, executable programs, typically implementing simple and autonomous tasks with a well defined purpose, which can be assumed as services provided by the Contract. In this work we analyze a concrete case study where the microservices architecture environment is replicated and implemented through an equivalent set of smart contracts, showing for the first time the feasibility of implementing a microservices-based system with smart contracts and how the two innovative paradigms match together. Results show that it is possible to implement a simple microservices-based system with smart contracts maintaining the same set of functionalities and results. The result could be highly beneficial in contexts such as smart voting, where not only the data integrity is fundamental but also the source code executed must be trustable.},

abstract={Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV), also known as Unmanned Air Systems (UAS), are gaining more attention in recent years. Some potential commercial applications may include cargo transfer between major cities, package and food delivery to individual households, etc. However, it is well-known that UAVs are much less reliable and have far more accidents than manned aircraft. This is probably one of the most important reasons that FAA is hesitant to open up the national airspace (NAS) and imposes tight restrictions to UAVs. In this paper, we present some recent research results done by our team to deal with major contingencies such as lost communications and engines failures. In particular, contingency planning software prototypes have been developed that can deal with those aforementioned major contingencies. Architectures of contingency planning software and some exemplar application scenarios will be discussed throughout the paper.},

abstract={The focus of research into 5G networks to date has been largely on the required advances in network architectures, technologies, and infrastructures. Less effort has been put on the applications and services that will make use of and exploit the flexibility of 5G networks built upon the concept of software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). Media-based applications are amongst the most demanding services, requiring large bandwidths for high audio–visual quality, low-latency for interactivity, and sufficient infrastructure resources to deliver the computational power for running the media applications in the networked cloud. This paper presents a novel service virtualization platform (SVP), called 5G-MEDIA SVP, which leverages the principles of NFV and SDN to facilitate the development, deployment, and operation of media services on 5G networks. The platform offers an advanced cognitive management environment for the provisioning of network services (NSs) and media-related applications, which directly link their lifecycle management with user experience as well as optimization of infrastructure resource utilization. Another innovation of 5G-MEDIA SVP is the integration of serverless computing with media intensive applications in 5G networks, increasing cost effectiveness of operation and simplifying development and deployment time. The proposed SVP is being validated against three media use cases: 1) immersive virtual reality 3-D gaming application; 2) remote production of broadcast content incorporating user generated contents; and 3) dynamically adaptive content distribution networks for the intelligent distribution of ultrahigh definition content. The preliminary results of the 5G-MEDIA SVP platform evaluation are compared against current practice and show that the proposed platform provides enhanced functionality for the operators and infrastructure owners, while ensuring better NS performance to service providers and end users.},

year={2019},

pages={1-1},
abstract={In order to construct a high-performance synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) drive system, an intelligent maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) tracking control using a recurrent Legendre fuzzy neural network (RLFNN) is proposed in this study. First, a traditional MTPA (TMTPA) control system based on fieldoriented control (FOC) is introduced. Since the reluctance torque of the SynRM is highly nonlinear and time-varying, the MTPA tracking control is very difficult to achieve by using the TMTPA control in practical applications. Then, an adaptive computed current (ACC) speed control using the proposed RLFNN for the MTPA tracking control of a SynRM drive system, which does not use a lookup table and can effectively obtain the optimal current angle command of MTPA online, is described in detail. The ACC speed control is applied to generate the stator current magnitude command, and an adaptation law is proposed to online adapt the value of a lumped uncertainty in the ACC control. Moreover, the adaptation law is derived using the Lyapunov stability theorem to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the ACC speed control. Furthermore, the proposed RLFNN is employed to produce the incremental command of the current angle. In addition, the ACC speed control and RLFNN are implemented in a TMS320F28075 32-bit floating-point digital signal processor (DSP) for a 4 kW SynRM drive system. Finally, the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed intelligent MTPA tracking control are verified by some experimental results.},

pages={969-976},
abstract={Ground level enhancement (GLE) 72, which occurred 10 September 2017, is the most recent of two solar particle-induced enhancements in ground level measurements of cosmic radiation secondary neutrons in solar cycle 24. GLEs have been unusually rare in this solar cycle. GLEs can significantly increase ionizing radiation dose rates at aviation altitudes for hours to days, leading to concern among crewmembers. Real-time monitoring and preliminary evaluation of solar proton events, including GLEs, in regard to effective dose rates at aviation altitudes has been ongoing since the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration began operating its Solar Radiation Alert System (SRAS) in 2002. Since then, SRAS has been revised multiple times. In this report, model calculations of dose rates during GLE 72 from Maps of Ionizing Radiation in the Atmosphere (MIRA), the latest SRAS software based on CARI-7A, are compared with those from the model Professional Aviation Dose Calculator (PANDOCA) developed by the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt). At very low cutoff rigidities model calculations agree within 40% and indicate no significant increase in radiation exposures at commercial aviation altitudes. The larger than expected differences at very low cutoff rigidities indicate Geostationary Orbiting Environmental Satellite particle flux data alone that are insufficient to produce consistent solar particle dose estimates.},

abstract={Space weather is an important driver of the exposure of aircrew and passengers to cosmic rays at flight altitudes, which has been a matter of concern for several decades. The assessment of the corresponding radiation doses can be realized by measurements or model calculations that cover the whole range of the radiation field in terms of geomagnetic shielding, atmospheric shielding, and the effects of space weather. Since the radiation field at aviation altitudes is very complex in terms of particle composition and energy distribution, the accurate experimental determination of doses at aviation altitudes is still a challenging task. Accordingly, the amount of data with comparatively small uncertainties is scarce. The Community Coordinated Modeling Center invited the Federal Aviation Administration, the German Aerospace Center, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to make their radiation models for aviation CARI-7A, PANDOCA, and NAIRAS available for interested users via the Community Coordinated Modeling Center web site. A concomitant comparison of model calculations with measuring data provided information on the predicting capabilities and the uncertainties of the current versions of these models under quiet space weather conditions.},

abstract={By the advent of FaaS Cloud services and the micro-services programming architecture, designing task allocation algorithms with higher performance has become a crucial task. Motivated by this high-interested challenge, we propose a new allocation algorithm called PESS-MinA based on our novel modular model for FaaS Edge-Cloud environments. In contradiction to widely-used Max-Min and Min-Min algorithms which are both reactive and deterministic, this algorithm is based on stochastic score, and thus provides proactivity considerations. Experiments with Google Cloud Trace dataset show that our algorithm exhibits better performance in both resource load balancing and QoS assurance of FaaS. According to simulations, PESS-MinA decreased the dropped tasks percentage from 2.9% to 0.01%, alongside with a triple balancing score.},

The fuzziness of FE is remedied here by creating an intelligent, self-adaptive and flexible decision model The proposed model is non-bureaucratic, manages fuzziness, and it is capable to provide insight for future trends Furthermore, it contributes to knowledge accumulation by maintaining all data of ideas, both accepted or rejected, enabling knowledge based design. The intelligent is provided by the growth of idea, their computation and assessment. I.e. the model itself weighs ideas independently and adaptively by respecting the size and population of the associated idea group. This is achieved by using K-means clustering algorithm by which meaningful changes in accumulated ideas are detected to calculate trend. The synthesized model supports managers and researchers to organize the FFE.},

abstract={The emergence of virtualisation and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) have dramatically transformed the telecom industry through network function virtualisation (NFV). A recently introduced cloud-native concept, Platform as a Service (PaaS), ensures to further boost the performance, portability and cost efficiency of the NFV. The 5G-MEDIA project proposes the application of a serverless paradigm known as Function-as-a- Service (FaaS) to NFV for the media applications exploiting the 5G technologies. In addition to integration of FaaS, the 5G-MEDIA application/service development kit (SDK) supports microservice-based application development for both hypervisor-based and containerized approaches, specifically supporting Docker, unikernel and LXC. In this paper, we provide an overview of the 5G-MEDIA SDK which is built to support NFV-based next generation media applications and to achieve a development time in the order of minutes.

abstract={Paphia textile is a shellfish which widely consumed by the society and it can be contaminated with heavy metals due to the increasing in domestic and industrial activities. This research was carried out to study the efficiency of catalytic chelation technique to remove heavy metals like lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and nickel (Ni) from Paphia textile. Three types of chelating agents, namely trisodium citrate, sodium acetate and disodium oxalate and three types of catalysts supported on Al2O3 namely MgO, CaO and BaO were used. The treatment conditions were carried out using chelating agent at 400 mg/L, one-hour treatment time and treatment temperature of 32.50 ± 0.50°C. Metal concentrations were analyzed using Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS). The initial concentrations of Pb, Ni and Cd in P. textile were 1.77±0.09 μg/g, 0.82±0.07 μg/g and 0.85±0.00 μg/g and removed to 84.69%, 78.60% and 41.96% respectively after chelation treatment. The trend of chelating agent followed the order of trisodium citrate, sodium acetate and disodium oxalate. Further treatment using catalyst revealed CaO/Al2O3 catalysts gave the highest percentage removal with 87.79% of Pb, 83.56% of Ni and 76.43% of Cd at an optimum calcination temperature of 1000°C. This study had successfully proven that catalytic chelation technique is able to enhance the removal of heavy metals compared to chelation technique from P. textile to achieve permissible limits set by Malaysian Food Regulation (Cd and Ni: 1.00 μg/g; Pb: 2.00 μg/g) and Commission Regulation of European Union (Cd and Ni: 1.00 μg/g; Pb: 1.50 μg/g).},

abstract={On-Device AI is an emerging paradigm that aims to make devices more intelligent, autonomous and proactive by equipping them with machine and deep learning routines for robust decision making and optimal execution in devices' operations. On-Device intelligence promises the possibility of computing huge amounts of data close to its source, e.g., sensor and multimedia data. By doing so, devices can complement their counterpart cloud services with more sophisticated functionality to provide better applications and services. However, increased computational capabilities of smart devices, wearables and IoT devices along with the emergence of services at the Edge of the network are driving the trend of migrating and distributing computation between devices. Indeed, devices can reduce the burden of executing resource intensive tasks via collaborations in the wild. While several work has shown the benefits of an opportunistic collaboration of a device with others, not much is known regarding how devices can be organized as a group as they move together. In this paper, we contribute by analyzing how dynamic group organization of devices can be utilized to distribute intelligence on the moving Edge. The key insight is that instead of On-Device solutions complementing with cloud, dynamic groups can be formed to complement each other in an On-Multi-Device manner. Thus, we highlight the challenges and opportunities from extending the scope of On-Device AI from an egocentric view to a collaborative, multi-device view.},
